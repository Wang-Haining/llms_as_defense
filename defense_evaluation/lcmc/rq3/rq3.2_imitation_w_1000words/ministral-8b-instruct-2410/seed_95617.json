            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt to modern thinking in several ways. They argue that the Church is losing followers because it isn't always welcoming to certain groups or ideas, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. The Church's strong stance on these issues, while understandable, can appear outdated to some. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might prevent a further decline in its following.\n\nMoreover, some people are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these subjects. For instance, those who support abortion might feel uncomfortable in a community that considers it wrong. Similarly, those who advocate for same-sex marriage could feel alienated by the Church's stance against it.\n\nWhile the Church's opposition to female priests and married priests is a contentious issue, it's unclear if allowing these changes would have prevented past scandals. Some argue that the Church's celibate priesthood is a sign of its devotion to God, but others question why priests cannot also have family lives like other professionals. Ultimately, whether priests should be allowed to marry is a complex issue with no clear-cut answer.",
            "I don't personally see a problem with gay marriage. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice, so why should people be held responsible for their sexual orientation? It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to say that. It's not really a choice, like how some people are born straight and others are gay. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this either; it's not a security or moral issue. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "Allowing gay marriage is a logical conclusion as there's no compelling argument against it. Many people erroneously believe homosexual couples threaten traditional families, but this is misleading. The dynamics of a gay relationship are as unique as those of a heterosexual union, with both sharing similar elements. Civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should extend to all committed couples, regardless of sexual orientation. Currently, a partner cannot visit a sick spouse in a hospital due to legal restrictions, which seems illogical. Scientific studies show that gay couples have the same relationship factors contributing to satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The crux of the issue is that gay couples seek a legal document, not a church ceremony. Segregating gay couples into civil unions while excluding them from marriage is akin to separate but unequal treatment. Concerns about adoption and community impact are unfounded, as parenting skills and community involvement are personality-driven, not sexual orientation. The federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide, with a constitutional amendment reversing the current ban. President Bush's stance, largely rooted in moral and religious beliefs, is divisive, considering the government's role in enforcing religious standards. Stereotypes about gay people being psychologically damaged are unfounded, as indicated by the American Psychological Association's findings. Ignoring research and over-reliance on popular opinion fosters misunderstanding.",
            "Working at a hospital pharmacy this summer, I've noticed that the legality of a drug doesn't determine its medicinal benefits. While I don't advocate for the public availability of illegal substances, I believe they should be used for their medicinal properties as long as they're beneficial. Take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, for instance—pharmacies use these controlled substances regularly despite their illegal status, because they have proven medical uses. It's a matter of embracing the benefits of these substances, including marijuana, without being swayed by societal taboos.\n\nMarijuana's reputation isn't entirely justified, as it's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. Removing the stigma around marijuana is key to its responsible use. Gradual legalization could be an effective approach to integrating marijuana into society, but first, we must dispel the idea that it's a dangerous, taboo substance.",
            "Well, I think the church has certainly adapted to the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Back when I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses, and even matching shoes and purses. It was a bit more formal then, especially at my private school where we'd all meet there on weekends. But these days, they've introduced a teenager-specific mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually, especially during summer when you see folks in beach clothes coming straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now. It's certainly become more casual, which is a change from the formal attire of the past.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think those issues could have been entirely prevented. Even if priests were allowed to marry, it wouldn't necessarily change much. Some men who become pedophiles are married and still have attractions towards young kids. I think it's more about genetics than about being brought up in a particular way. I don't believe marriage could hide those tendencies. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, that would be shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. In terms of the church itself, I don't have any other thoughts to add.",
            "(Chuckles)\nInitially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the entire country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We seemed to have gone into Iraq under false pretenses, using the September 11th attacks as a pretext. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be completely false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and has yet to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, after presenting evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced. To me, that's malfeasance, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. It seems like they came into office with a mission to go to war. One of the Bush administration's former officials even wrote in his book that the younger Bush entered with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein. Additionally, there's a suspicion that they aimed to expand our energy supply. I think it's gone on too long, but I'm worried about what would happen if we withdrew now. The country could potentially lapse into civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, involving a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be a good idea either, as it could lead to more long-term problems over Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is dissolving, and the Parliament doesn't seem effective. The Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a messy situation.\n\n(Chuckles)\nNone that I can express in polite company",
            "Talk into it? Okay, let's chat. So, how do you feel about the War in Iraq? Let me think. Well, at this point, I think it's become somewhat pointless. It's not even a declared war, and I feel like it was just our way of getting back at Iraq, who we thought was behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into following the details of the war, but I understand we're trying to build democracy there to make it more like the U.S. and maybe secure oil resources. However, I don't think this is a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, it will upset everyone, and they'll have to rebuild their country from scratch. I'm just not an expert on this topic, so let me see if I can express my thoughts better. I believe the war should continue, but I don't think we should refer to it as a war anymore since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. We only use guns and such to show our strength, but I don't think there's a strong reason to keep calling it a war. I think it's better to stay and help build a better Iraq, but it's also a waste of resources. Plus, it makes Bush look like one of the worst presidents due to the current situation. It's like the Vietnam War all over again – undeclared and now called a meaningless war. If we continue the Iraq War, it could go on for years. It's hard to say if I want it to end because I know many families have loved ones in Iraq. They have lives too, and we've disrupted their society. But if we stay, we'll try to mold Iraq into something more like the U.S., which could cause more hatred and make the Al-Qaeda problem worse. I think it's going to be a long, drawn-out conflict. So, that's my take.",
            "It's just not right to make it legal or for a state to declare it as such. I firmly believe it's up to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It would be a clear defiance of the constitution to try and enforce any power over it. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for some areas like Boston. It's not the government's place to decide what churches can or can't make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Adding an amendment would be wrong and contradictory to the constitution, and it could be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. Therefore, I don't see why the federal government should be involved. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal Catholic beliefs, which is a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. It might even boost the economy and society in some ways.",
            "The war in Iraq is a complex and controversial issue. Let's start from the beginning. I don't believe the government was completely truthful with the American people regarding the reasons for the war.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq and link it to the September 11th terrorist attacks was, in my opinion, a leap in logic. The government played on the public's emotions to gain support for the invasion. The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the beginning, especially the preemptive strike.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq reminded me of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it seems they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not well-prepared for the chaos that followed.\n\nThe government removed the Iraqi government and attempted to install a democratic one, similar to the attempt in Vietnam. However, it was clear that this would be a lengthy and challenging process. The government should have been more transparent about the challenges ahead.\n\nLooking back, I think the government was not well-prepared for the aftermath and tried to conceal the difficulties from the public. This war has been ongoing for several years, and despite the training of Iraqi troops, the situation is still unstable.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one, and I struggled with it during the 2004 presidential election. I considered voting for George Bush because I believed he should finish what he started. However, the high number of American casualties and the question of whether the invasion was purely about oil also weighed heavily on me.\n\nIt is hard to know how much longer this war will continue. I hope it ends soon, but it may be naive to expect an immediate resolution.",

I think it's unfair to deny people rights over something they can't control. I mean, it's inhumane, and I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics or government should have a say in this—it's a personal, household matter. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples, and they live their lives just like any other family. I think it's absurd that Bush tries to interpret the meaning of marriage in his own way. It's just not right.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that being gay may be a chemical predisposition, not something influenced by upbringing. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something in the public eye or debated at the national level. No, I don't think it should be a public or federal issue.",

            "The war seems to have dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, it appears we've lost sight of that original purpose and are now possibly involved for the sake of demonstrating our global prowess. George Bush's father had previous disagreements with Saddam Hussein, and it's unclear if these personal grievances played a role. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, it would be justifiable. However, it seems our motivations have shifted and degenerated over time. We're now at war just for the sake of being at war, not wanting to appear weak by ending it without a decisive outcome. This conflict has been ongoing for too long, and it's time to stop. Other countries must take responsibility for their own governance, especially since we're spending billions on a war that we've long lost sight of. It's a significant strain on our economy, money that could be better spent addressing our own issues, such as poverty and healthcare.",
            "I have a question to clarify something.\n\nWell, it was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a situation like...\n\nSure, okay.\n\nNo, I don't think that’s an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. I understand that on Myspace, you need to have a friend or something to see someone’s profile. If that's the case, you’ve accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission, right? So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHmm, well, that's tough. I mean, obviously, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.\" I mean, I don’t think it would really be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But then again, it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence that the student was planning something, or were they just randomly looking and happened to see that?\n\nOh, I see. Well, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this man who went onto a girl’s profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like less than a minute and got her to meet with him. I mean, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it’s me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your appearance, sometimes even your class schedule. They pretty much know a lot about you – all sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but, at the same time, the whole point is I think the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don’t want to limit it too much. So, it’s a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.\n\nI heard that my roommate was telling me that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school. I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace. I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that. That’s the only other thought I can think of.",
            "Hmm\nUh\nAlright, a couple more things on the Iraq War.\nUh\nI guess I feel a bit hypocritical discussing it\nI mean, I don't want to join the chorus of people saying \"I was against it from the start\"\nBut I was, and it's not really relevant anymore\nBecause, well, pretty much everyone thought it was a bad idea except for the administration\nAnd now, you look at the polls\nUh\nSeventy-five to eighty percent worldwide think it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nSeventy percent of U.S. troops there\nI mean, even the people we're supposedly helping are telling us to leave\nAnd pulling out will be a disaster, but staying is too\nThere's just no right way to handle this\nUh\nI think it's just the cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle East\nWe think we can impose our way of life\nBut that's not how they want to run their lives\nAnd yes, Saddam was a bad guy, but invading wasn't the right move\nIt was like quicksand, once we got in, we couldn't get out\nI mean, what's the point of staying now?\nI haven't heard a solid reason from the administration\nAnd I read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave within the year\nThese are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go\nMaybe we should just listen to them\nIf they say we should leave, we can say we're going and not be blamed if things go wrong\nAnd if we do decide to help afterward, at least we'll be the good guys\nWell, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but it's a step up from where we are now",
            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just women; it affects men too, depending on the industry or the role they take on\nUm\nFor instance, while women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they struggle to break into positions of power in the business world, men can also face challenges\nUm\nTake, for example, a man in the fashion industry or a stay-at-home dad\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, men often face skepticism because they are perceived to lack understanding of the female perspective\nAnd a stay-at-home dad might face societal judgment for not being the primary breadwinner\nUm\nI believe that gender discrimination is prevalent across various fields and societal perceptions can vary greatly\nUm\nBut I think we're making progress, although it's slow, as more women are reaching higher positions and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted\nUm\nTo change society's mindset, it's essential to promote the positive qualities of those who face discrimination without being too forceful\nUm\nIt's a complex issue that requires time and patience to address fully",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, but they decriminalized it. Essentially, it's been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. If caught and cited, the repercussions for job interviews and other things won't be as severe as they would be for a drug charge. However, the future ramifications of getting caught are still a concern for many, especially kids and other worried individuals. Despite this, there's an argument that arrests and trials cost a lot of money, and many municipalities, especially those in financial distress, may not want to make that sort of concession. In a more liberal place like Denver, though, decriminalization has been successful, freeing up funds for programs like public education, social services for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not that we want marijuana to be everywhere, but rather that we should consider the financial implications as well. I don't know how I feel about it being widely available though, like cigarettes. It might lead to more people smoking and driving, which is taboo in many places. Additionally, I think alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more long-term effects on lifestyle. Ultimately, no two people react the same way to substances, and I think both have their adverse effects.",
            "Yes, I would say yes.\nYou know, a lot of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition, something they've done for a long time. It's good to be grounded in history, but it is also crucial to adapt to change.\nFor many Catholics, attending Church every week is a must, and their adherence to rituals is quite strict. Sometimes, I feel they look down on those who don't follow the rules strictly or are not perfect Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents' religions were different—my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian—and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's denomination. That's not very inclusive, especially considering the Church's teachings to love others.\nIt feels like the Church's doctrine and its practice don't always match up, as some teachings are quite outdated. They seem to hold onto traditions even when they're no longer relevant.\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily stop pedophilia, as the motivation behind such actions isn't necessarily linked to marital status. They might engage in such behavior regardless of their marital status. So, I don't think it would make a significant difference.",
            "I must admit, I'm still undecided on this matter. It's a prickly issue, straddling the line between church and state, and how to define marriage. Something so close to the heart of our society can be terribly tricky to navigate without causing offense. I believe that if we consider all civil unions as such, then it might make the most sense to treat them as such. After all, it's simply a union of two people, and the government should not delve into the specifics of one's religious or personal beliefs. If all states can come to a logical consensus, then they should push for federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. It's not important enough to warrant amending the constitution. Simply put, no.",
            "I was, after all, raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous to me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself. Many states are democratic, and others are republican, which means there's likely to be a vast difference of opinion on the subject. If you live in a democratic state, you understand the leaning towards legalizing gay marriage, and since you've chosen to live there, you should respect that decision. I believe homosexuals should enjoy the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and I believe legalization should be a state-by-state issue. Bush, I feel, shouldn't dictate how the entire country feels about this, as he won't be in office for much longer. If a democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just be another back-and-forth, and the best approach is to let each state decide based on their own values and beliefs.",
            "Some stories just grab your attention...like this one. Um, I don't at all. Um, let’s see, I'm not really sure how to put this. The way I figure it, Myspace is a public thing. It's basically a bulletin board where you post things for everyone to see. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it, whether they're school officials or not. So, I think it's only reasonable that school officials see what's posted on Myspace. Even if it's not under the school's name, they could access it through their homes. But, if it's to prevent something like a school shooting, which is a responsibility of the school system, then I think that's perfectly fine. I feel like it's a public thing, and the school officials aren't invading privacy if they're trying to make the school a safer place. I mean, they go on there just to catch students and get them in trouble, and that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, um, alright, well, um, hmm. It’s a lot easier to express yourself when you’re writing, but, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing. And, with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that’s ridiculous. Um, everything, like I’m worried to post stuff, even through emails, because I’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up. Um, like, everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. Like, you know, if you do something while you’re a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, and they find an email that you sent somehow. And, once it’s on the internet, it’s always on the internet, and there's no way of getting out of it. You will get in trouble, and it wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, it’s a public thing. Um, I don’t know, let’s see here. Like I had said before, I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. Um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they’re dropping them off at a safe place. I’ve actually discussed that with a teacher of mine. I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff. And, um, that’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks. Uh, we had to be safe about that. We had drill stuff, and even though that doesn’t have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was, you know, in case people would come into the building, I guess. Um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place. And, um, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case. They were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh, no, that’s about it.",
            "I initially supported the war, especially given my personal connection to 9/11. I wanted justice and to cause as much chaos as they did to us. However, I believe we acted irrationally, driven by emotion and anger, without a clear plan. I now question if it was the right decision. The people there, as long as they're fighting each other, won't be fighting with us. I don't think our presence there is making a difference. They're more interested in getting us to leave than improving their own country. We were just looking for revenge, and the president acted on the people's emotions. We couldn't let Iraq get away with attacking us, but I think we could have had a better plan. There was no clear goal or unity. I don't think we're making enough progress to stay there, and I believe that once we leave, the situation will collapse. We're harming ourselves by staying."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt to modern thinking in several ways. They argue that the Church is losing followers because it isn't always welcoming to certain groups or ideas, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. The Church's strong stance on these issues, while understandable, can appear outdated to some. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might prevent a further decline in its following.\n\nMoreover, some people are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these subjects. For instance, those who support abortion might feel uncomfortable in a community that considers it wrong. Similarly, those who advocate for same-sex marriage could feel alienated by the Church's stance against it.\n\nWhile the Church's opposition to female priests and married priests is a contentious issue, it's unclear if allowing these changes would have prevented past scandals. Some argue that the Church's celibate priesthood is a sign of its devotion to God, but others question why priests cannot also have family lives like other professionals. Ultimately, whether priests should be allowed to marry is a complex issue with no clear-cut answer.",
            "I don't personally see a problem with gay marriage. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice, so why should people be held responsible for their sexual orientation? It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to say that. It's not really a choice, like how some people are born straight and others are gay. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this either; it's not a security or moral issue. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "Allowing gay marriage is a logical conclusion as there's no compelling argument against it. Many people erroneously believe homosexual couples threaten traditional families, but this is misleading. The dynamics of a gay relationship are as unique as those of a heterosexual union, with both sharing similar elements. Civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should extend to all committed couples, regardless of sexual orientation. Currently, a partner cannot visit a sick spouse in a hospital due to legal restrictions, which seems illogical. Scientific studies show that gay couples have the same relationship factors contributing to satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The crux of the issue is that gay couples seek a legal document, not a church ceremony. Segregating gay couples into civil unions while excluding them from marriage is akin to separate but unequal treatment. Concerns about adoption and community impact are unfounded, as parenting skills and community involvement are personality-driven, not sexual orientation. The federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide, with a constitutional amendment reversing the current ban. President Bush's stance, largely rooted in moral and religious beliefs, is divisive, considering the government's role in enforcing religious standards. Stereotypes about gay people being psychologically damaged are unfounded, as indicated by the American Psychological Association's findings. Ignoring research and over-reliance on popular opinion fosters misunderstanding.",
            "Working at a hospital pharmacy this summer, I've noticed that the legality of a drug doesn't determine its medicinal benefits. While I don't advocate for the public availability of illegal substances, I believe they should be used for their medicinal properties as long as they're beneficial. Take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, for instance—pharmacies use these controlled substances regularly despite their illegal status, because they have proven medical uses. It's a matter of embracing the benefits of these substances, including marijuana, without being swayed by societal taboos.\n\nMarijuana's reputation isn't entirely justified, as it's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. Removing the stigma around marijuana is key to its responsible use. Gradual legalization could be an effective approach to integrating marijuana into society, but first, we must dispel the idea that it's a dangerous, taboo substance.",
            "Well, I think the church has certainly adapted to the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Back when I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses, and even matching shoes and purses. It was a bit more formal then, especially at my private school where we'd all meet there on weekends. But these days, they've introduced a teenager-specific mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually, especially during summer when you see folks in beach clothes coming straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now. It's certainly become more casual, which is a change from the formal attire of the past.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think those issues could have been entirely prevented. Even if priests were allowed to marry, it wouldn't necessarily change much. Some men who become pedophiles are married and still have attractions towards young kids. I think it's more about genetics than about being brought up in a particular way. I don't believe marriage could hide those tendencies. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, that would be shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. In terms of the church itself, I don't have any other thoughts to add.",
            "(Chuckles)\nInitially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the entire country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We seemed to have gone into Iraq under false pretenses, using the September 11th attacks as a pretext. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be completely false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and has yet to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, after presenting evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced. To me, that's malfeasance, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. It seems like they came into office with a mission to go to war. One of the Bush administration's former officials even wrote in his book that the younger Bush entered with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein. Additionally, there's a suspicion that they aimed to expand our energy supply. I think it's gone on too long, but I'm worried about what would happen if we withdrew now. The country could potentially lapse into civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, involving a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be a good idea either, as it could lead to more long-term problems over Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is dissolving, and the Parliament doesn't seem effective. The Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a messy situation.\n\n(Chuckles)\nNone that I can express in polite company",
            "Talk into it? Okay, let's chat. So, how do you feel about the War in Iraq? Let me think. Well, at this point, I think it's become somewhat pointless. It's not even a declared war, and I feel like it was just our way of getting back at Iraq, who we thought was behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into following the details of the war, but I understand we're trying to build democracy there to make it more like the U.S. and maybe secure oil resources. However, I don't think this is a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, it will upset everyone, and they'll have to rebuild their country from scratch. I'm just not an expert on this topic, so let me see if I can express my thoughts better. I believe the war should continue, but I don't think we should refer to it as a war anymore since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. We only use guns and such to show our strength, but I don't think there's a strong reason to keep calling it a war. I think it's better to stay and help build a better Iraq, but it's also a waste of resources. Plus, it makes Bush look like one of the worst presidents due to the current situation. It's like the Vietnam War all over again – undeclared and now called a meaningless war. If we continue the Iraq War, it could go on for years. It's hard to say if I want it to end because I know many families have loved ones in Iraq. They have lives too, and we've disrupted their society. But if we stay, we'll try to mold Iraq into something more like the U.S., which could cause more hatred and make the Al-Qaeda problem worse. I think it's going to be a long, drawn-out conflict. So, that's my take.",
            "It's just not right to make it legal or for a state to declare it as such. I firmly believe it's up to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It would be a clear defiance of the constitution to try and enforce any power over it. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for some areas like Boston. It's not the government's place to decide what churches can or can't make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Adding an amendment would be wrong and contradictory to the constitution, and it could be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. Therefore, I don't see why the federal government should be involved. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal Catholic beliefs, which is a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. It might even boost the economy and society in some ways.",
            "The war in Iraq is a complex and controversial issue. Let's start from the beginning. I don't believe the government was completely truthful with the American people regarding the reasons for the war.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq and link it to the September 11th terrorist attacks was, in my opinion, a leap in logic. The government played on the public's emotions to gain support for the invasion. The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the beginning, especially the preemptive strike.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq reminded me of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it seems they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not well-prepared for the chaos that followed.\n\nThe government removed the Iraqi government and attempted to install a democratic one, similar to the attempt in Vietnam. However, it was clear that this would be a lengthy and challenging process. The government should have been more transparent about the challenges ahead.\n\nLooking back, I think the government was not well-prepared for the aftermath and tried to conceal the difficulties from the public. This war has been ongoing for several years, and despite the training of Iraqi troops, the situation is still unstable.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one, and I struggled with it during the 2004 presidential election. I considered voting for George Bush because I believed he should finish what he started. However, the high number of American casualties and the question of whether the invasion was purely about oil also weighed heavily on me.\n\nIt is hard to know how much longer this war will continue. I hope it ends soon, but it may be naive to expect an immediate resolution.",
            "Well, let me just say, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. It's a personal choice, and I believe it's rooted more in biology than sociology. I think it's unfair to deny people rights over something they can't control. I mean, it's inhumane, and I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics or government should have a say in this—it's a personal, household matter. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples, and they live their lives just like any other family. I think it's absurd that Bush tries to interpret the meaning of marriage in his own way. It's just not right.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that being gay may be a chemical predisposition, not something influenced by upbringing. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something in the public eye or debated at the national level. No, I don't think it should be a public or federal issue.",

            "The war seems to have dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, it appears we've lost sight of that original purpose and are now possibly involved for the sake of demonstrating our global prowess. George Bush's father had previous disagreements with Saddam Hussein, and it's unclear if these personal grievances played a role. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, it would be justifiable. However, it seems our motivations have shifted and degenerated over time. We're now at war just for the sake of being at war, not wanting to appear weak by ending it without a decisive outcome. This conflict has been ongoing for too long, and it's time to stop. Other countries must take responsibility for their own governance, especially since we're spending billions on a war that we've long lost sight of. It's a significant strain on our economy, money that could be better spent addressing our own issues, such as poverty and healthcare.",
            "I have a question to clarify something.\n\nWell, it was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a situation like...\n\nSure, okay.\n\nNo, I don't think that’s an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. I understand that on Myspace, you need to have a friend or something to see someone’s profile. If that's the case, you’ve accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission, right? So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHmm, well, that's tough. I mean, obviously, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.\" I mean, I don’t think it would really be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But then again, it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence that the student was planning something, or were they just randomly looking and happened to see that?\n\nOh, I see. Well, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this man who went onto a girl’s profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like less than a minute and got her to meet with him. I mean, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it’s me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your appearance, sometimes even your class schedule. They pretty much know a lot about you – all sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but, at the same time, the whole point is I think the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don’t want to limit it too much. So, it’s a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.\n\nI heard that my roommate was telling me that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school. I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace. I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that. That’s the only other thought I can think of.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just women; it affects men too, depending on the industry or the role they take on\nUm\nFor instance, while women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they struggle to break into positions of power in the business world, men can also face challenges\nUm\nTake, for example, a man in the fashion industry or a stay-at-home dad\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, men often face skepticism because they are perceived to lack understanding of the female perspective\nAnd a stay-at-home dad might face societal judgment for not being the primary breadwinner\nUm\nI believe that gender discrimination is prevalent across various fields and societal perceptions can vary greatly\nUm\nBut I think we're making progress, although it's slow, as more women are reaching higher positions and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted\nUm\nTo change society's mindset, it's essential to promote the positive qualities of those who face discrimination without being too forceful\nUm\nIt's a complex issue that requires time and patience to address fully",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, but they decriminalized it. Essentially, it's been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. If caught and cited, the repercussions for job interviews and other things won't be as severe as they would be for a drug charge. However, the future ramifications of getting caught are still a concern for many, especially kids and other worried individuals. Despite this, there's an argument that arrests and trials cost a lot of money, and many municipalities, especially those in financial distress, may not want to make that sort of concession. In a more liberal place like Denver, though, decriminalization has been successful, freeing up funds for programs like public education, social services for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not that we want marijuana to be everywhere, but rather that we should consider the financial implications as well. I don't know how I feel about it being widely available though, like cigarettes. It might lead to more people smoking and driving, which is taboo in many places. Additionally, I think alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more long-term effects on lifestyle. Ultimately, no two people react the same way to substances, and I think both have their adverse effects.",
            "Yes, I would say yes.\nYou know, a lot of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition, something they've done for a long time. It's good to be grounded in history, but it is also crucial to adapt to change.\nFor many Catholics, attending Church every week is a must, and their adherence to rituals is quite strict. Sometimes, I feel they look down on those who don't follow the rules strictly or are not perfect Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents' religions were different—my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian—and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's denomination. That's not very inclusive, especially considering the Church's teachings to love others.\nIt feels like the Church's doctrine and its practice don't always match up, as some teachings are quite outdated. They seem to hold onto traditions even when they're no longer relevant.\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily stop pedophilia, as the motivation behind such actions isn't necessarily linked to marital status. They might engage in such behavior regardless of their marital status. So, I don't think it would make a significant difference.",
            "I must admit, I'm still undecided on this matter. It's a prickly issue, straddling the line between church and state, and how to define marriage. Something so close to the heart of our society can be terribly tricky to navigate without causing offense. I believe that if we consider all civil unions as such, then it might make the most sense to treat them as such. After all, it's simply a union of two people, and the government should not delve into the specifics of one's religious or personal beliefs. If all states can come to a logical consensus, then they should push for federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. It's not important enough to warrant amending the constitution. Simply put, no.",
            "I was, after all, raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous to me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself. Many states are democratic, and others are republican, which means there's likely to be a vast difference of opinion on the subject. If you live in a democratic state, you understand the leaning towards legalizing gay marriage, and since you've chosen to live there, you should respect that decision. I believe homosexuals should enjoy the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and I believe legalization should be a state-by-state issue. Bush, I feel, shouldn't dictate how the entire country feels about this, as he won't be in office for much longer. If a democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just be another back-and-forth, and the best approach is to let each state decide based on their own values and beliefs.",
            "Some stories just grab your attention...like this one. Um, I don't at all. Um, let’s see, I'm not really sure how to put this. The way I figure it, Myspace is a public thing. It's basically a bulletin board where you post things for everyone to see. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it, whether they're school officials or not. So, I think it's only reasonable that school officials see what's posted on Myspace. Even if it's not under the school's name, they could access it through their homes. But, if it's to prevent something like a school shooting, which is a responsibility of the school system, then I think that's perfectly fine. I feel like it's a public thing, and the school officials aren't invading privacy if they're trying to make the school a safer place. I mean, they go on there just to catch students and get them in trouble, and that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, um, alright, well, um, hmm. It’s a lot easier to express yourself when you’re writing, but, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing. And, with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that’s ridiculous. Um, everything, like I’m worried to post stuff, even through emails, because I’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up. Um, like, everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. Like, you know, if you do something while you’re a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, and they find an email that you sent somehow. And, once it’s on the internet, it’s always on the internet, and there's no way of getting out of it. You will get in trouble, and it wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, it’s a public thing. Um, I don’t know, let’s see here. Like I had said before, I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. Um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they’re dropping them off at a safe place. I’ve actually discussed that with a teacher of mine. I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff. And, um, that’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks. Uh, we had to be safe about that. We had drill stuff, and even though that doesn’t have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was, you know, in case people would come into the building, I guess. Um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place. And, um, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case. They were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh, no, that’s about it.",
            "I initially supported the war, especially given my personal connection to 9/11. I wanted justice and to cause as much chaos as they did to us. However, I believe we acted irrationally, driven by emotion and anger, without a clear plan. I now question if it was the right decision. The people there, as long as they're fighting each other, won't be fighting with us. I don't think our presence there is making a difference. They're more interested in getting us to leave than improving their own country. We were just looking for revenge, and the president acted on the people's emotions. We couldn't let Iraq get away with attacking us, but I think we could have had a better plan. There was no clear goal or unity. I don't think we're making enough progress to stay there, and I believe that once we leave, the situation will collapse. We're harming ourselves by staying."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt to modern thinking in several ways. They argue that the Church is losing followers because it isn't always welcoming to certain groups or ideas, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. The Church's strong stance on these issues, while understandable, can appear outdated to some. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might prevent a further decline in its following.\n\nMoreover, some people are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these subjects. For instance, those who support abortion might feel uncomfortable in a community that considers it wrong. Similarly, those who advocate for same-sex marriage could feel alienated by the Church's stance against it.\n\nWhile the Church's opposition to female priests and married priests is a contentious issue, it's unclear if allowing these changes would have prevented past scandals. Some argue that the Church's celibate priesthood is a sign of its devotion to God, but others question why priests cannot also have family lives like other professionals. Ultimately, whether priests should be allowed to marry is a complex issue with no clear-cut answer.",
            "I don't personally see a problem with gay marriage. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice, so why should people be held responsible for their sexual orientation? It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to say that. It's not really a choice, like how some people are born straight and others are gay. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this either; it's not a security or moral issue. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "Allowing gay marriage is a logical conclusion as there's no compelling argument against it. Many people erroneously believe homosexual couples threaten traditional families, but this is misleading. The dynamics of a gay relationship are as unique as those of a heterosexual union, with both sharing similar elements. Civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should extend to all committed couples, regardless of sexual orientation. Currently, a partner cannot visit a sick spouse in a hospital due to legal restrictions, which seems illogical. Scientific studies show that gay couples have the same relationship factors contributing to satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The crux of the issue is that gay couples seek a legal document, not a church ceremony. Segregating gay couples into civil unions while excluding them from marriage is akin to separate but unequal treatment. Concerns about adoption and community impact are unfounded, as parenting skills and community involvement are personality-driven, not sexual orientation. The federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide, with a constitutional amendment reversing the current ban. President Bush's stance, largely rooted in moral and religious beliefs, is divisive, considering the government's role in enforcing religious standards. Stereotypes about gay people being psychologically damaged are unfounded, as indicated by the American Psychological Association's findings. Ignoring research and over-reliance on popular opinion fosters misunderstanding.",
            "Working at a hospital pharmacy this summer, I've noticed that the legality of a drug doesn't determine its medicinal benefits. While I don't advocate for the public availability of illegal substances, I believe they should be used for their medicinal properties as long as they're beneficial. Take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, for instance—pharmacies use these controlled substances regularly despite their illegal status, because they have proven medical uses. It's a matter of embracing the benefits of these substances, including marijuana, without being swayed by societal taboos.\n\nMarijuana's reputation isn't entirely justified, as it's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. Removing the stigma around marijuana is key to its responsible use. Gradual legalization could be an effective approach to integrating marijuana into society, but first, we must dispel the idea that it's a dangerous, taboo substance.",
            "Well, I think the church has certainly adapted to the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Back when I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses, and even matching shoes and purses. It was a bit more formal then, especially at my private school where we'd all meet there on weekends. But these days, they've introduced a teenager-specific mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually, especially during summer when you see folks in beach clothes coming straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now. It's certainly become more casual, which is a change from the formal attire of the past.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think those issues could have been entirely prevented. Even if priests were allowed to marry, it wouldn't necessarily change much. Some men who become pedophiles are married and still have attractions towards young kids. I think it's more about genetics than about being brought up in a particular way. I don't believe marriage could hide those tendencies. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, that would be shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. In terms of the church itself, I don't have any other thoughts to add.",
            "(Chuckles)\nInitially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the entire country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We seemed to have gone into Iraq under false pretenses, using the September 11th attacks as a pretext. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be completely false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and has yet to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, after presenting evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced. To me, that's malfeasance, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. It seems like they came into office with a mission to go to war. One of the Bush administration's former officials even wrote in his book that the younger Bush entered with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein. Additionally, there's a suspicion that they aimed to expand our energy supply. I think it's gone on too long, but I'm worried about what would happen if we withdrew now. The country could potentially lapse into civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, involving a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be a good idea either, as it could lead to more long-term problems over Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is dissolving, and the Parliament doesn't seem effective. The Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a messy situation.\n\n(Chuckles)\nNone that I can express in polite company",
            "Talk into it? Okay, let's chat. So, how do you feel about the War in Iraq? Let me think. Well, at this point, I think it's become somewhat pointless. It's not even a declared war, and I feel like it was just our way of getting back at Iraq, who we thought was behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into following the details of the war, but I understand we're trying to build democracy there to make it more like the U.S. and maybe secure oil resources. However, I don't think this is a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, it will upset everyone, and they'll have to rebuild their country from scratch. I'm just not an expert on this topic, so let me see if I can express my thoughts better. I believe the war should continue, but I don't think we should refer to it as a war anymore since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. We only use guns and such to show our strength, but I don't think there's a strong reason to keep calling it a war. I think it's better to stay and help build a better Iraq, but it's also a waste of resources. Plus, it makes Bush look like one of the worst presidents due to the current situation. It's like the Vietnam War all over again – undeclared and now called a meaningless war. If we continue the Iraq War, it could go on for years. It's hard to say if I want it to end because I know many families have loved ones in Iraq. They have lives too, and we've disrupted their society. But if we stay, we'll try to mold Iraq into something more like the U.S., which could cause more hatred and make the Al-Qaeda problem worse. I think it's going to be a long, drawn-out conflict. So, that's my take.",
            "It's just not right to make it legal or for a state to declare it as such. I firmly believe it's up to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It would be a clear defiance of the constitution to try and enforce any power over it. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for some areas like Boston. It's not the government's place to decide what churches can or can't make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Adding an amendment would be wrong and contradictory to the constitution, and it could be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. Therefore, I don't see why the federal government should be involved. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal Catholic beliefs, which is a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. It might even boost the economy and society in some ways.",
            "The war in Iraq is a complex and controversial issue. Let's start from the beginning. I don't believe the government was completely truthful with the American people regarding the reasons for the war.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq and link it to the September 11th terrorist attacks was, in my opinion, a leap in logic. The government played on the public's emotions to gain support for the invasion. The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the beginning, especially the preemptive strike.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq reminded me of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it seems they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not well-prepared for the chaos that followed.\n\nThe government removed the Iraqi government and attempted to install a democratic one, similar to the attempt in Vietnam. However, it was clear that this would be a lengthy and challenging process. The government should have been more transparent about the challenges ahead.\n\nLooking back, I think the government was not well-prepared for the aftermath and tried to conceal the difficulties from the public. This war has been ongoing for several years, and despite the training of Iraqi troops, the situation is still unstable.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one, and I struggled with it during the 2004 presidential election. I considered voting for George Bush because I believed he should finish what he started. However, the high number of American casualties and the question of whether the invasion was purely about oil also weighed heavily on me.\n\nIt is hard to know how much longer this war will continue. I hope it ends soon, but it may be naive to expect an immediate resolution.",
            "Well, let me just say, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. It's a personal choice, and I believe it's rooted more in biology than sociology. I think it's unfair to deny people rights over something they can't control. I mean, it's inhumane, and I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics or government should have a say in this—it's a personal, household matter. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples, and they live their lives just like any other family. I think it's absurd that Bush tries to interpret the meaning of marriage in his own way. It's just not right.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that being gay may be a chemical predisposition, not something influenced by upbringing. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something in the public eye or debated at the national level. No, I don't think it should be a public or federal issue.",

            "The war seems to have dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, it appears we've lost sight of that original purpose and are now possibly involved for the sake of demonstrating our global prowess. George Bush's father had previous disagreements with Saddam Hussein, and it's unclear if these personal grievances played a role. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, it would be justifiable. However, it seems our motivations have shifted and degenerated over time. We're now at war just for the sake of being at war, not wanting to appear weak by ending it without a decisive outcome. This conflict has been ongoing for too long, and it's time to stop. Other countries must take responsibility for their own governance, especially since we're spending billions on a war that we've long lost sight of. It's a significant strain on our economy, money that could be better spent addressing our own issues, such as poverty and healthcare.",
            "I have a question to clarify something.\n\nWell, it was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a situation like...\n\nSure, okay.\n\nNo, I don't think that’s an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. I understand that on Myspace, you need to have a friend or something to see someone’s profile. If that's the case, you’ve accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission, right? So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHmm, well, that's tough. I mean, obviously, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.\" I mean, I don’t think it would really be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But then again, it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence that the student was planning something, or were they just randomly looking and happened to see that?\n\nOh, I see. Well, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this man who went onto a girl’s profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like less than a minute and got her to meet with him. I mean, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it’s me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your appearance, sometimes even your class schedule. They pretty much know a lot about you – all sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but, at the same time, the whole point is I think the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don’t want to limit it too much. So, it’s a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.\n\nI heard that my roommate was telling me that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school. I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace. I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that. That’s the only other thought I can think of.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just women; it affects men too, depending on the industry or the role they take on\nUm\nFor instance, while women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they struggle to break into positions of power in the business world, men can also face challenges\nUm\nTake, for example, a man in the fashion industry or a stay-at-home dad\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, men often face skepticism because they are perceived to lack understanding of the female perspective\nAnd a stay-at-home dad might face societal judgment for not being the primary breadwinner\nUm\nI believe that gender discrimination is prevalent across various fields and societal perceptions can vary greatly\nUm\nBut I think we're making progress, although it's slow, as more women are reaching higher positions and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted\nUm\nTo change society's mindset, it's essential to promote the positive qualities of those who face discrimination without being too forceful\nUm\nIt's a complex issue that requires time and patience to address fully",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, but they decriminalized it. Essentially, it's been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. If caught and cited, the repercussions for job interviews and other things won't be as severe as they would be for a drug charge. However, the future ramifications of getting caught are still a concern for many, especially kids and other worried individuals. Despite this, there's an argument that arrests and trials cost a lot of money, and many municipalities, especially those in financial distress, may not want to make that sort of concession. In a more liberal place like Denver, though, decriminalization has been successful, freeing up funds for programs like public education, social services for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not that we want marijuana to be everywhere, but rather that we should consider the financial implications as well. I don't know how I feel about it being widely available though, like cigarettes. It might lead to more people smoking and driving, which is taboo in many places. Additionally, I think alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more long-term effects on lifestyle. Ultimately, no two people react the same way to substances, and I think both have their adverse effects.",
            "Yes, I would say yes.\nYou know, a lot of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition, something they've done for a long time. It's good to be grounded in history, but it is also crucial to adapt to change.\nFor many Catholics, attending Church every week is a must, and their adherence to rituals is quite strict. Sometimes, I feel they look down on those who don't follow the rules strictly or are not perfect Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents' religions were different—my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian—and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's denomination. That's not very inclusive, especially considering the Church's teachings to love others.\nIt feels like the Church's doctrine and its practice don't always match up, as some teachings are quite outdated. They seem to hold onto traditions even when they're no longer relevant.\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily stop pedophilia, as the motivation behind such actions isn't necessarily linked to marital status. They might engage in such behavior regardless of their marital status. So, I don't think it would make a significant difference.",
            "I must admit, I'm still undecided on this matter. It's a prickly issue, straddling the line between church and state, and how to define marriage. Something so close to the heart of our society can be terribly tricky to navigate without causing offense. I believe that if we consider all civil unions as such, then it might make the most sense to treat them as such. After all, it's simply a union of two people, and the government should not delve into the specifics of one's religious or personal beliefs. If all states can come to a logical consensus, then they should push for federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. It's not important enough to warrant amending the constitution. Simply put, no.",
            "I was, after all, raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous to me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself. Many states are democratic, and others are republican, which means there's likely to be a vast difference of opinion on the subject. If you live in a democratic state, you understand the leaning towards legalizing gay marriage, and since you've chosen to live there, you should respect that decision. I believe homosexuals should enjoy the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and I believe legalization should be a state-by-state issue. Bush, I feel, shouldn't dictate how the entire country feels about this, as he won't be in office for much longer. If a democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just be another back-and-forth, and the best approach is to let each state decide based on their own values and beliefs.",
            "Some stories just grab your attention...like this one. Um, I don't at all. Um, let’s see, I'm not really sure how to put this. The way I figure it, Myspace is a public thing. It's basically a bulletin board where you post things for everyone to see. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it, whether they're school officials or not. So, I think it's only reasonable that school officials see what's posted on Myspace. Even if it's not under the school's name, they could access it through their homes. But, if it's to prevent something like a school shooting, which is a responsibility of the school system, then I think that's perfectly fine. I feel like it's a public thing, and the school officials aren't invading privacy if they're trying to make the school a safer place. I mean, they go on there just to catch students and get them in trouble, and that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, um, alright, well, um, hmm. It’s a lot easier to express yourself when you’re writing, but, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing. And, with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that’s ridiculous. Um, everything, like I’m worried to post stuff, even through emails, because I’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up. Um, like, everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. Like, you know, if you do something while you’re a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, and they find an email that you sent somehow. And, once it’s on the internet, it’s always on the internet, and there's no way of getting out of it. You will get in trouble, and it wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, it’s a public thing. Um, I don’t know, let’s see here. Like I had said before, I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. Um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they’re dropping them off at a safe place. I’ve actually discussed that with a teacher of mine. I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff. And, um, that’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks. Uh, we had to be safe about that. We had drill stuff, and even though that doesn’t have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was, you know, in case people would come into the building, I guess. Um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place. And, um, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case. They were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh, no, that’s about it.",
            "I initially supported the war, especially given my personal connection to 9/11. I wanted justice and to cause as much chaos as they did to us. However, I believe we acted irrationally, driven by emotion and anger, without a clear plan. I now question if it was the right decision. The people there, as long as they're fighting each other, won't be fighting with us. I don't think our presence there is making a difference. They're more interested in getting us to leave than improving their own country. We were just looking for revenge, and the president acted on the people's emotions. We couldn't let Iraq get away with attacking us, but I think we could have had a better plan. There was no clear goal or unity. I don't think we're making enough progress to stay there, and I believe that once we leave, the situation will collapse. We're harming ourselves by staying."
