            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in several ways. It's no secret that the institution is experiencing a decline in its flock, and I think this is largely due to its rigid stances on certain issues. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which can be off-putting to many people. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective, I think they would see a decrease in those turning away from their teachings. Many are increasingly finding issue with the Church's views on these subjects, and I feel that they may be losing followers because of it. For instance, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's considered completely wrong. Similarly, those who are in favor of gay marriage might not want to be part of a following that disapproves. While I don't think allowing female priests or married clergy would have necessarily prevented the recent scandals, I believe the Church could benefit from adopting a more modern approach. The notion of priests being 'married to God' and dedicating their lives exclusively to their faith is outdated, especially compared to the modern world where people typically balance their work and personal lives.",
            "Look, I'm not here to argue for or against gay marriage. It's not something I've given much thought to, but I don't think it's right to say that people who are gay shouldn't get married just because they were born that way. It's not a choice, so I don't think they should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but people of the same sex can't. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who these people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's not the government's place to interfere in people's personal lives.",
            "I believe that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There aren't any compelling reasons against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples endanger the traditional family structure, but this perspective overlooks the numerous differences and complexities involved. It's like comparing two sides of a coin; one can never be the same as the other, yet they are fundamentally the same. When it comes to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, marriage offers a way for couples to share responsibilities and support each other. In a relationship, it doesn't matter whether it's between a man and a woman or two men or two women. Homosexual couples have the same relationship factors and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. What people often misunderstand is that married couples aren't asking for religious ceremonies; they just want a legal document from the government. It's like segregation; separate but unequal. The federal government should legalize gay marriage across all states. I'm concerned that President Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies among individuals and groups. Using religious beliefs to create an amendment banning gay marriage is hypocritical, especially when considering recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage, but this is not supported by research. The American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to scientific research instead of popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Now, it's not that illegal drugs are inherently beneficial, but they can have medicinal uses. Personally, I'm not a fan of making those drugs available to the public. However, for medicinal purposes? Absolutely. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial, and I think we should give it a fair shake if it can help people. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's illegal, but pharmacists use it all the time because it has benefits. If we deny that just because of the taboo around marijuana, that's not right.\n\nYou see, there are a lot of drugs that are illegal but have their uses. We should be embracing the benefits of marijuana, not dismissing them just because of its illegal status. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol. Abusing either can lead to bad things, but marijuana isn't as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we remove the stigma, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday in cute dresses and matching shoes. But now, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer. You'll see families running in late, and even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. As for the accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I think those couldn't have been prevented. Men who are married and still become pedophiles—it's not about being allowed to marry or not. It's about the person. When they choose to become priests, they're still attracted to young kids, regardless of their marital status. I think it's more about genetics than upbringing. The church might not have been able to prevent this, but if they knew about it and covered it up, shame on them. I don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "A chuckle escaped me as I reflected on the Iraq War. Initially, I was fine with the idea, but given the lingering trauma from September 11, it seemed like we entered the conflict under false pretenses. The Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, suggesting Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction—a claim that's since proven false. This has always irked me, and the Iraq conflict still gets under my skin.\n\nThe Bush administration's dishonesty didn't stop there. They fed the American people a line of lies and, even now, haven't taken responsibility for it. Colin Powell, for instance, admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially since 9/11. They seem to have entered office with a desire to go to war.\n\nA former Treasury Secretary, whose name I can't recall, alleged that the younger Bush was seeking revenge for his father's administration and expansion of our energy supply—both underhanded motivations. I believe the conflict has dragged on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\n\nThe UN and the U.S. are considering a coalition with regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea. It could exacerbate problems, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a significant issue. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and with the Parliament ineffective and factions vying for control, political instability looms.",
            "You want to discuss the War in Iraq? Alright, let's see. Well, at this point, I feel it's rather pointless. It wasn't even a declared war, right? It was more of a \"get back at Iraq\" thing because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into keeping up with it, to be honest. I don't know the details, but I know we're over there trying to build democracy and get oil, but it's not worth it, as it's causing more unrest and chaos. If we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever. And if we leave, they'll be angry because we messed things up. It's a tough topic.\n\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair, and we're not really calling it a war anymore. We're using guns to show we're strong and American. But I don't think it's a real reason to stay over there. It should have been declared by Congress, but it wasn't. I don't think it's a big point to stay and try to help, as it's wasting our resources. It's making Bush look bad, too. Like in the Vietnam War, it's now called a meaningless war, and he'll be remembered as the president who started it. I'd say it'll go on for years and years. It's hard to want it to end because of the families affected. I don't know, it's complicated.",
            "I simply don't think it's fair or right to legalize it or even for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe any attempt to enforce control over this issue would defy that principle. I feel it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the constitution allows for religious tolerance. Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for some areas like Boston. I don't believe the government should be involved in this debate as it's not about the economy or society's well-being. The President's push for this amendment seems to be more about his personal Catholic beliefs and preferences than anything else. It's not my place to decide what's best for religion, it's up to the churches.",
            "The war in Iraq\nWell, to begin, I don't believe the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though in reality, they didn't have much in common. The government exploited the public's outrage and grief over 9/11 to justify the invasion, which began in 2003. I am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I believe the Iraq War was a repeat of many aspects of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it didn't. The war has resulted in a significant number of American casualties, and the government was unprepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The U.S. removed Iraq's government and tried to implement a democratic one, similar to the Cold War effort in Vietnam. However, the U.S. government should have known that establishing democracy is a long and difficult process. They made it seem like a short, successful mission, which was naive. The war continues today, with many American troops still risking their lives. The U.S. government didn't plan for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They should have known it would take years to successfully implement a new form of government. The decision to vote for George Bush in the 2004 election was influenced by my concern for the people in Iraq. I couldn't abandon them after we took away their government and way of life. However, there's also the consideration of the high American casualties involved. The war in Iraq is a difficult decision because it's incredibly hard to abandon the people we have been helping. I just hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it's unlikely.",
            "Alright, let's dive right in. I've always been in favor of gay marriage, and I think it's a matter of personal preference. It's been increasingly shown that it could be biological, not sociological, so denying people rights based on something they can't control is, in my opinion, inhumane. I'm always an advocate for gay marriage. I don't think politics or government should interfere; it's a personal issue that should be decided at the household level. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs and go about their daily lives without issue. I find it absurd that Bush is trying to dictate how we interpret marriage, especially when people can get married without anyone's notice, but gay couples can't. It's a private matter that should stay private. I've read that it's tied to a chemical predisposition in the brain, not societal influences like being an only child or growing up in a single-parent household. I also think that if a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so quietly, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it becomes a public spectacle. It's a private affair, not something to be dictated by the government. And no, I don't think there's any reason for it to be a matter of national or federal policy.",

            "The war seems to have lasted far too long. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've long since lost sight of that purpose, and our actions now seem more about proving our superpower status. Additionally, there may have been personal agendas involving George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original motivation was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be understandable, but if there were ulterior motives, it would be unjust. Our purpose was initially clear and achieved in the first few months, but the conflict has dragged on for years. It feels like we're prolonging the war to avoid losing face rather than achieving a decisive victory. We've been fighting for too long, and it's time for the other country's government to take charge. We're draining our economy with this endless conflict, and there are pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need our attention. The money spent on this war could be better used to fund our own needs, not to sustain a prolonged conflict that has lost its original cause.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that the incident was averted because someone found some information online. Ok, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. I mean, you accept that people can see your profile if they're your \"friend.\" So, anytime you put information on the internet, you have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. If someone was able to prevent a tragedy by seeing that, then it was a good thing. It's tough, though, because you can't have someone looking at everyone's profiles all the time. That could become a form of discrimination, like, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" It wouldn't be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation, though. Maybe they were looking for evidence that a student was planning something. I don't really know. Sure, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. I'm bothered by the idea of creepy people out there knowing things about me. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in less than a minute, just by looking at her profile. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes IM me, knowing who I am, without me knowing their real name. It's hard because they might know a lot about you, like your interests, what you look like, your class schedule, who your friends are, and all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I have it to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.",
            "You know, I just feel awkward discussing this, honestly. I mean, I'd hate to be lumped in with those who were against the Iraq War from day one, but I really was. It's just, like, why even bother talking about it now? Everyone seems to agree it was a bad idea, except for the administration, of course. I mean, look at the polls. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide think it was a mistake, including eighty percent of Iraqis, and seventy percent of U.S. troops over there think we should pull out within the year. It's been a disaster from the start and pulling out will be just as bad. The situation in the Middle East is a mess, and the culture gap is too huge for us to comprehend or impose our will. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like stepping into quicksand. I don't know what to say about the whole ordeal. I don't see a reason to stick around, but I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas. I haven't heard a legitimate reason why we should stay. If we want to leave gradually, that's fine, but why not just go now? Eighty percent of Iraqis think we should leave within the year, and a quarter think we should leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask and they say yes, at least we can say we tried. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we are now.",
            "Certainly, I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It also affects individuals based on the field of work they're involved in. For instance, in the corporate world, there's the 'glass ceiling'—the unspoken barrier that prevents qualified women from reaching higher positions simply because historically, men have dominated the top echelons of the business world. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home and be the primary caregiver often face societal disapproval, with people questioning why they aren't working instead. In the fashion industry, men often struggle to be taken seriously, as their interests are not typically associated with traditional male roles. These issues stem from deeply ingrained societal expectations and stereotypes. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's essential to continue working towards equality without forcing it too rapidly, as this can lead to resistance. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on other factors such as one's upbringing and education. For example, someone from a rural background might face bias due to their grammar or accent, despite their intelligence and capabilities.",
            "The states have, well, they've decriminalized marijuana, rather than fully legalizing it. This means it's now treated more like a traffic ticket than a criminal offense. While this change has its pros and cons, some of the potential future repercussions are still a concern for people, especially in terms of how it could affect job interviews. On the other end, there's a financial argument too. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. Consequently, some cities, particularly those that are financially struggling, might not be eager to make this change even if it could free up resources. However, in more liberal cities like Denver, the decision to decriminalize marijuana seems to be working well, and the extra money has been used to fund public education, elderly care, and homeless programs. But, I'm not sure I'd want to see it sold in gas stations like cigarettes, with people smoking it everywhere. It's still a bit taboo in many places, and I think it would just feel awkward if it were so widely accepted. Plus, while alcohol can impair your motor skills, marijuana can have more severe effects on people's lives. However, no two people react the same way to substances, and it's hard to generalize. Both alcohol and marijuana have their own negative impacts.",
            "I would agree\nBecause\nWell\nA lot of their practices are very traditional\nLike they've been doing the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to maintain tradition\nBut\nIt’s also essential to be flexible to change\nWell\nMany Catholics believe they must attend Church weekly\nAnd\nThey’re quite strict about how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on those who don’t follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nThey’re not accepting of those who aren’t pure Catholics\nAnd\nThey also reject people of other faiths\nLike\nFor instance\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI apologize\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nJust because of my dad's religion\n\nSo\nThat’s not really\nA tolerant approach\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn that way\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut\nThe Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to adhere to it anyway\n\nI don’t think that would necessarily affect it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily stop them from\nLike\nEngaging in pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nI probably don’t think that would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably occur anyway",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't definitively say who's right or wrong. However, it's certainly one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. On one hand, the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are delicate subjects that can easily offend people. On the other hand, if marriage is considered a sacrament or a union between two people, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or secular context? I think all civil unions, including those between same-sex couples, should be recognized by the government as civil unions rather than marriage. It's about two people committing to each other, not about the nature of their union. If all states can come to a logical conclusion on this matter, they should push to make it federal law. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't broad enough to warrant such a change. It's not a large enough cause to amend the constitution. Simply put, no",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so homosexuality remains a complex issue for me. My close circle includes many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national concern but rather a decision for each state to make individually. This is because many states lean one way or another politically, and I find it unfair for a national leader to impose their views on an issue that largely affects the locals. I believe that every state should decide for itself whether to legalize gay marriage based on its own values and preferences. I don't think President Bush, for instance, should impose his views on the entire country. I understand that he is a democratically elected leader, but I don't agree with his stance on this issue. I think that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own stance on gay marriage, and I believe that his current policy should be left to their discretion. After all, it's the residents of these states who will ultimately face the consequences of such a decision, not the president.",
            "Well, let me break it down. Myspace is, by definition, a public space. Posting something on the internet is akin to shouting it from a hilltop; it's meant to be seen by others. So when school officials access a student's Myspace page, they're not violating any privacy rights. It's like having a conversation in a public forum – you can't expect it to stay private. However, I don't think they should use the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that might make the school safer, then they're doing their job. It's a delicate balance, like how parents expect schools to be safe havens. Lockdown drills and other safety measures aren't about student privacy, they're about preventing tragedies like the ones we've seen. So, I guess they're just doing their duty to keep the school safe. That's my two cents.",

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in several ways. It's no secret that the institution is experiencing a decline in its flock, and I think this is largely due to its rigid stances on certain issues. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which can be off-putting to many people. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective, I think they would see a decrease in those turning away from their teachings. Many are increasingly finding issue with the Church's views on these subjects, and I feel that they may be losing followers because of it. For instance, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's considered completely wrong. Similarly, those who are in favor of gay marriage might not want to be part of a following that disapproves. While I don't think allowing female priests or married clergy would have necessarily prevented the recent scandals, I believe the Church could benefit from adopting a more modern approach. The notion of priests being 'married to God' and dedicating their lives exclusively to their faith is outdated, especially compared to the modern world where people typically balance their work and personal lives.",
            "Look, I'm not here to argue for or against gay marriage. It's not something I've given much thought to, but I don't think it's right to say that people who are gay shouldn't get married just because they were born that way. It's not a choice, so I don't think they should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but people of the same sex can't. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who these people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's not the government's place to interfere in people's personal lives.",
            "I believe that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There aren't any compelling reasons against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples endanger the traditional family structure, but this perspective overlooks the numerous differences and complexities involved. It's like comparing two sides of a coin; one can never be the same as the other, yet they are fundamentally the same. When it comes to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, marriage offers a way for couples to share responsibilities and support each other. In a relationship, it doesn't matter whether it's between a man and a woman or two men or two women. Homosexual couples have the same relationship factors and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. What people often misunderstand is that married couples aren't asking for religious ceremonies; they just want a legal document from the government. It's like segregation; separate but unequal. The federal government should legalize gay marriage across all states. I'm concerned that President Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies among individuals and groups. Using religious beliefs to create an amendment banning gay marriage is hypocritical, especially when considering recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage, but this is not supported by research. The American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to scientific research instead of popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Now, it's not that illegal drugs are inherently beneficial, but they can have medicinal uses. Personally, I'm not a fan of making those drugs available to the public. However, for medicinal purposes? Absolutely. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial, and I think we should give it a fair shake if it can help people. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's illegal, but pharmacists use it all the time because it has benefits. If we deny that just because of the taboo around marijuana, that's not right.\n\nYou see, there are a lot of drugs that are illegal but have their uses. We should be embracing the benefits of marijuana, not dismissing them just because of its illegal status. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol. Abusing either can lead to bad things, but marijuana isn't as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we remove the stigma, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday in cute dresses and matching shoes. But now, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer. You'll see families running in late, and even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. As for the accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I think those couldn't have been prevented. Men who are married and still become pedophiles—it's not about being allowed to marry or not. It's about the person. When they choose to become priests, they're still attracted to young kids, regardless of their marital status. I think it's more about genetics than upbringing. The church might not have been able to prevent this, but if they knew about it and covered it up, shame on them. I don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "A chuckle escaped me as I reflected on the Iraq War. Initially, I was fine with the idea, but given the lingering trauma from September 11, it seemed like we entered the conflict under false pretenses. The Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, suggesting Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction—a claim that's since proven false. This has always irked me, and the Iraq conflict still gets under my skin.\n\nThe Bush administration's dishonesty didn't stop there. They fed the American people a line of lies and, even now, haven't taken responsibility for it. Colin Powell, for instance, admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially since 9/11. They seem to have entered office with a desire to go to war.\n\nA former Treasury Secretary, whose name I can't recall, alleged that the younger Bush was seeking revenge for his father's administration and expansion of our energy supply—both underhanded motivations. I believe the conflict has dragged on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\n\nThe UN and the U.S. are considering a coalition with regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea. It could exacerbate problems, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a significant issue. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and with the Parliament ineffective and factions vying for control, political instability looms.",
            "You want to discuss the War in Iraq? Alright, let's see. Well, at this point, I feel it's rather pointless. It wasn't even a declared war, right? It was more of a \"get back at Iraq\" thing because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into keeping up with it, to be honest. I don't know the details, but I know we're over there trying to build democracy and get oil, but it's not worth it, as it's causing more unrest and chaos. If we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever. And if we leave, they'll be angry because we messed things up. It's a tough topic.\n\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair, and we're not really calling it a war anymore. We're using guns to show we're strong and American. But I don't think it's a real reason to stay over there. It should have been declared by Congress, but it wasn't. I don't think it's a big point to stay and try to help, as it's wasting our resources. It's making Bush look bad, too. Like in the Vietnam War, it's now called a meaningless war, and he'll be remembered as the president who started it. I'd say it'll go on for years and years. It's hard to want it to end because of the families affected. I don't know, it's complicated.",
            "I simply don't think it's fair or right to legalize it or even for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe any attempt to enforce control over this issue would defy that principle. I feel it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the constitution allows for religious tolerance. Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for some areas like Boston. I don't believe the government should be involved in this debate as it's not about the economy or society's well-being. The President's push for this amendment seems to be more about his personal Catholic beliefs and preferences than anything else. It's not my place to decide what's best for religion, it's up to the churches.",
            "The war in Iraq\nWell, to begin, I don't believe the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though in reality, they didn't have much in common. The government exploited the public's outrage and grief over 9/11 to justify the invasion, which began in 2003. I am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I believe the Iraq War was a repeat of many aspects of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it didn't. The war has resulted in a significant number of American casualties, and the government was unprepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The U.S. removed Iraq's government and tried to implement a democratic one, similar to the Cold War effort in Vietnam. However, the U.S. government should have known that establishing democracy is a long and difficult process. They made it seem like a short, successful mission, which was naive. The war continues today, with many American troops still risking their lives. The U.S. government didn't plan for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They should have known it would take years to successfully implement a new form of government. The decision to vote for George Bush in the 2004 election was influenced by my concern for the people in Iraq. I couldn't abandon them after we took away their government and way of life. However, there's also the consideration of the high American casualties involved. The war in Iraq is a difficult decision because it's incredibly hard to abandon the people we have been helping. I just hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it's unlikely.",
            "Alright, let's dive right in. I've always been in favor of gay marriage, and I think it's a matter of personal preference. It's been increasingly shown that it could be biological, not sociological, so denying people rights based on something they can't control is, in my opinion, inhumane. I'm always an advocate for gay marriage. I don't think politics or government should interfere; it's a personal issue that should be decided at the household level. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs and go about their daily lives without issue. I find it absurd that Bush is trying to dictate how we interpret marriage, especially when people can get married without anyone's notice, but gay couples can't. It's a private matter that should stay private. I've read that it's tied to a chemical predisposition in the brain, not societal influences like being an only child or growing up in a single-parent household. I also think that if a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so quietly, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it becomes a public spectacle. It's a private affair, not something to be dictated by the government. And no, I don't think there's any reason for it to be a matter of national or federal policy.",

            "The war seems to have lasted far too long. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've long since lost sight of that purpose, and our actions now seem more about proving our superpower status. Additionally, there may have been personal agendas involving George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original motivation was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be understandable, but if there were ulterior motives, it would be unjust. Our purpose was initially clear and achieved in the first few months, but the conflict has dragged on for years. It feels like we're prolonging the war to avoid losing face rather than achieving a decisive victory. We've been fighting for too long, and it's time for the other country's government to take charge. We're draining our economy with this endless conflict, and there are pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need our attention. The money spent on this war could be better used to fund our own needs, not to sustain a prolonged conflict that has lost its original cause.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that the incident was averted because someone found some information online. Ok, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. I mean, you accept that people can see your profile if they're your \"friend.\" So, anytime you put information on the internet, you have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. If someone was able to prevent a tragedy by seeing that, then it was a good thing. It's tough, though, because you can't have someone looking at everyone's profiles all the time. That could become a form of discrimination, like, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" It wouldn't be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation, though. Maybe they were looking for evidence that a student was planning something. I don't really know. Sure, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. I'm bothered by the idea of creepy people out there knowing things about me. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in less than a minute, just by looking at her profile. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes IM me, knowing who I am, without me knowing their real name. It's hard because they might know a lot about you, like your interests, what you look like, your class schedule, who your friends are, and all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I have it to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.",
            "You know, I just feel awkward discussing this, honestly. I mean, I'd hate to be lumped in with those who were against the Iraq War from day one, but I really was. It's just, like, why even bother talking about it now? Everyone seems to agree it was a bad idea, except for the administration, of course. I mean, look at the polls. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide think it was a mistake, including eighty percent of Iraqis, and seventy percent of U.S. troops over there think we should pull out within the year. It's been a disaster from the start and pulling out will be just as bad. The situation in the Middle East is a mess, and the culture gap is too huge for us to comprehend or impose our will. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like stepping into quicksand. I don't know what to say about the whole ordeal. I don't see a reason to stick around, but I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas. I haven't heard a legitimate reason why we should stay. If we want to leave gradually, that's fine, but why not just go now? Eighty percent of Iraqis think we should leave within the year, and a quarter think we should leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask and they say yes, at least we can say we tried. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we are now.",
            "Certainly, I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It also affects individuals based on the field of work they're involved in. For instance, in the corporate world, there's the 'glass ceiling'—the unspoken barrier that prevents qualified women from reaching higher positions simply because historically, men have dominated the top echelons of the business world. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home and be the primary caregiver often face societal disapproval, with people questioning why they aren't working instead. In the fashion industry, men often struggle to be taken seriously, as their interests are not typically associated with traditional male roles. These issues stem from deeply ingrained societal expectations and stereotypes. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's essential to continue working towards equality without forcing it too rapidly, as this can lead to resistance. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on other factors such as one's upbringing and education.

While this change has its pros and cons, some of the potential future repercussions are still a concern for people, especially in terms of how it could affect job interviews. On the other end, there's a financial argument too. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. Consequently, some cities, particularly those that are financially struggling, might not be eager to make this change even if it could free up resources. However, in more liberal cities like Denver, the decision to decriminalize marijuana seems to be working well, and the extra money has been used to fund public education, elderly care, and homeless programs. But, I'm not sure I'd want to see it sold in gas stations like cigarettes, with people smoking it everywhere. It's still a bit taboo in many places, and I think it would just feel awkward if it were so widely accepted. Plus, while alcohol can impair your motor skills, marijuana can have more severe effects on people's lives. However, no two people react the same way to substances, and it's hard to generalize. Both alcohol and marijuana have their own negative impacts.",
            "I would agree\nBecause\nWell\nA lot of their practices are very traditional\nLike they've been doing the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to maintain tradition\nBut\nIt’s also essential to be flexible to change\nWell\nMany Catholics believe they must attend Church weekly\nAnd\nThey’re quite strict about how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on those who don’t follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nThey’re not accepting of those who aren’t pure Catholics\nAnd\nThey also reject people of other faiths\nLike\nFor instance\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI apologize\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nJust because of my dad's religion\n\nSo\nThat’s not really\nA tolerant approach\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn that way\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut\nThe Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to adhere to it anyway\n\nI don’t think that would necessarily affect it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily stop them from\nLike\nEngaging in pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nI probably don’t think that would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably occur anyway",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't definitively say who's right or wrong. However, it's certainly one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. On one hand, the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are delicate subjects that can easily offend people. On the other hand, if marriage is considered a sacrament or a union between two people, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or secular context? I think all civil unions, including those between same-sex couples, should be recognized by the government as civil unions rather than marriage. It's about two people committing to each other, not about the nature of their union. If all states can come to a logical conclusion on this matter, they should push to make it federal law. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't broad enough to warrant such a change. It's not a large enough cause to amend the constitution. Simply put, no",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so homosexuality remains a complex issue for me. My close circle includes many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national concern but rather a decision for each state to make individually. This is because many states lean one way or another politically, and I find it unfair for a national leader to impose their views on an issue that largely affects the locals. I believe that every state should decide for itself whether to legalize gay marriage based on its own values and preferences. I don't think President Bush, for instance, should impose his views on the entire country. I understand that he is a democratically elected leader, but I don't agree with his stance on this issue. I think that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own stance on gay marriage, and I believe that his current policy should be left to their discretion. After all, it's the residents of these states who will ultimately face the consequences of such a decision, not the president.",
            "Well, let me break it down. Myspace is, by definition, a public space. Posting something on the internet is akin to shouting it from a hilltop; it's meant to be seen by others. So when school officials access a student's Myspace page, they're not violating any privacy rights. It's like having a conversation in a public forum – you can't expect it to stay private. However, I don't think they should use the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that might make the school safer, then they're doing their job. It's a delicate balance, like how parents expect schools to be safe havens. Lockdown drills and other safety measures aren't about student privacy, they're about preventing tragedies like the ones we've seen. So, I guess they're just doing their duty to keep the school safe. That's my two cents.",
            "Um\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was all for it, as I was personally affected by 9/11\nUm\nI was all for going over there and creating as much chaos as they had here\nUm\nI think that since it was such a raw, emotional event,\nWe overlooked a lot and didn't really think about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of just went over there, unprepared, without a clear plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nUm\nI don’t know\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting among themselves, they can’t be fighting with us\nLike, I don’t think our presence there is gonna make a difference if they can’t even get along\nSo um\nLike unfortunately, because of 9/11, I’ve almost become indifferent to what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care anymore\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war over there is very different from war here\nThey’re just like savage when it comes to war and I don’t think they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that there was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly, I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in several ways. It's no secret that the institution is experiencing a decline in its flock, and I think this is largely due to its rigid stances on certain issues. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which can be off-putting to many people. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective, I think they would see a decrease in those turning away from their teachings. Many are increasingly finding issue with the Church's views on these subjects, and I feel that they may be losing followers because of it. For instance, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's considered completely wrong. Similarly, those who are in favor of gay marriage might not want to be part of a following that disapproves. While I don't think allowing female priests or married clergy would have necessarily prevented the recent scandals, I believe the Church could benefit from adopting a more modern approach. The notion of priests being 'married to God' and dedicating their lives exclusively to their faith is outdated, especially compared to the modern world where people typically balance their work and personal lives.",
            "Look, I'm not here to argue for or against gay marriage. It's not something I've given much thought to, but I don't think it's right to say that people who are gay shouldn't get married just because they were born that way. It's not a choice, so I don't think they should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but people of the same sex can't. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who these people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's not the government's place to interfere in people's personal lives.",
            "I believe that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There aren't any compelling reasons against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples endanger the traditional family structure, but this perspective overlooks the numerous differences and complexities involved. It's like comparing two sides of a coin; one can never be the same as the other, yet they are fundamentally the same. When it comes to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, marriage offers a way for couples to share responsibilities and support each other. In a relationship, it doesn't matter whether it's between a man and a woman or two men or two women. Homosexual couples have the same relationship factors and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. What people often misunderstand is that married couples aren't asking for religious ceremonies; they just want a legal document from the government. It's like segregation; separate but unequal. The federal government should legalize gay marriage across all states. I'm concerned that President Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies among individuals and groups. Using religious beliefs to create an amendment banning gay marriage is hypocritical, especially when considering recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage, but this is not supported by research. The American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to scientific research instead of popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Now, it's not that illegal drugs are inherently beneficial, but they can have medicinal uses. Personally, I'm not a fan of making those drugs available to the public. However, for medicinal purposes? Absolutely. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial, and I think we should give it a fair shake if it can help people. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's illegal, but pharmacists use it all the time because it has benefits. If we deny that just because of the taboo around marijuana, that's not right.\n\nYou see, there are a lot of drugs that are illegal but have their uses. We should be embracing the benefits of marijuana, not dismissing them just because of its illegal status. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol. Abusing either can lead to bad things, but marijuana isn't as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we remove the stigma, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday in cute dresses and matching shoes. But now, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer. You'll see families running in late, and even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. As for the accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I think those couldn't have been prevented. Men who are married and still become pedophiles—it's not about being allowed to marry or not. It's about the person. When they choose to become priests, they're still attracted to young kids, regardless of their marital status. I think it's more about genetics than upbringing. The church might not have been able to prevent this, but if they knew about it and covered it up, shame on them. I don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "A chuckle escaped me as I reflected on the Iraq War. Initially, I was fine with the idea, but given the lingering trauma from September 11, it seemed like we entered the conflict under false pretenses. The Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, suggesting Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction—a claim that's since proven false. This has always irked me, and the Iraq conflict still gets under my skin.\n\nThe Bush administration's dishonesty didn't stop there. They fed the American people a line of lies and, even now, haven't taken responsibility for it. Colin Powell, for instance, admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially since 9/11. They seem to have entered office with a desire to go to war.\n\nA former Treasury Secretary, whose name I can't recall, alleged that the younger Bush was seeking revenge for his father's administration and expansion of our energy supply—both underhanded motivations. I believe the conflict has dragged on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\n\nThe UN and the U.S. are considering a coalition with regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea. It could exacerbate problems, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a significant issue. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and with the Parliament ineffective and factions vying for control, political instability looms.",
            "You want to discuss the War in Iraq? Alright, let's see. Well, at this point, I feel it's rather pointless. It wasn't even a declared war, right? It was more of a \"get back at Iraq\" thing because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into keeping up with it, to be honest. I don't know the details, but I know we're over there trying to build democracy and get oil, but it's not worth it, as it's causing more unrest and chaos. If we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever. And if we leave, they'll be angry because we messed things up. It's a tough topic.\n\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair, and we're not really calling it a war anymore. We're using guns to show we're strong and American. But I don't think it's a real reason to stay over there. It should have been declared by Congress, but it wasn't. I don't think it's a big point to stay and try to help, as it's wasting our resources. It's making Bush look bad, too. Like in the Vietnam War, it's now called a meaningless war, and he'll be remembered as the president who started it. I'd say it'll go on for years and years. It's hard to want it to end because of the families affected. I don't know, it's complicated.",
            "I simply don't think it's fair or right to legalize it or even for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe any attempt to enforce control over this issue would defy that principle. I feel it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the constitution allows for religious tolerance. Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for some areas like Boston. I don't believe the government should be involved in this debate as it's not about the economy or society's well-being. The President's push for this amendment seems to be more about his personal Catholic beliefs and preferences than anything else. It's not my place to decide what's best for religion, it's up to the churches.",
            "The war in Iraq\nWell, to begin, I don't believe the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though in reality, they didn't have much in common. The government exploited the public's outrage and grief over 9/11 to justify the invasion, which began in 2003. I am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I believe the Iraq War was a repeat of many aspects of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it didn't. The war has resulted in a significant number of American casualties, and the government was unprepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The U.S. removed Iraq's government and tried to implement a democratic one, similar to the Cold War effort in Vietnam. However, the U.S. government should have known that establishing democracy is a long and difficult process. They made it seem like a short, successful mission, which was naive. The war continues today, with many American troops still risking their lives. The U.S. government didn't plan for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They should have known it would take years to successfully implement a new form of government. The decision to vote for George Bush in the 2004 election was influenced by my concern for the people in Iraq. I couldn't abandon them after we took away their government and way of life. However, there's also the consideration of the high American casualties involved. The war in Iraq is a difficult decision because it's incredibly hard to abandon the people we have been helping. I just hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it's unlikely.",
            "Alright, let's dive right in. I've always been in favor of gay marriage, and I think it's a matter of personal preference. It's been increasingly shown that it could be biological, not sociological, so denying people rights based on something they can't control is, in my opinion, inhumane. I'm always an advocate for gay marriage. I don't think politics or government should interfere; it's a personal issue that should be decided at the household level. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs and go about their daily lives without issue. I find it absurd that Bush is trying to dictate how we interpret marriage, especially when people can get married without anyone's notice, but gay couples can't. It's a private matter that should stay private. I've read that it's tied to a chemical predisposition in the brain, not societal influences like being an only child or growing up in a single-parent household. I also think that if a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so quietly, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it becomes a public spectacle. It's a private affair, not something to be dictated by the government. And no, I don't think there's any reason for it to be a matter of national or federal policy.",

            "The war seems to have lasted far too long. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've long since lost sight of that purpose, and our actions now seem more about proving our superpower status. Additionally, there may have been personal agendas involving George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original motivation was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be understandable, but if there were ulterior motives, it would be unjust. Our purpose was initially clear and achieved in the first few months, but the conflict has dragged on for years. It feels like we're prolonging the war to avoid losing face rather than achieving a decisive victory. We've been fighting for too long, and it's time for the other country's government to take charge. We're draining our economy with this endless conflict, and there are pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need our attention. The money spent on this war could be better used to fund our own needs, not to sustain a prolonged conflict that has lost its original cause.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that the incident was averted because someone found some information online. Ok, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. I mean, you accept that people can see your profile if they're your \"friend.\" So, anytime you put information on the internet, you have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. If someone was able to prevent a tragedy by seeing that, then it was a good thing. It's tough, though, because you can't have someone looking at everyone's profiles all the time. That could become a form of discrimination, like, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" It wouldn't be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation, though. Maybe they were looking for evidence that a student was planning something. I don't really know. Sure, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. I'm bothered by the idea of creepy people out there knowing things about me. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in less than a minute, just by looking at her profile. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes IM me, knowing who I am, without me knowing their real name. It's hard because they might know a lot about you, like your interests, what you look like, your class schedule, who your friends are, and all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I have it to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.",
            "You know, I just feel awkward discussing this, honestly. I mean, I'd hate to be lumped in with those who were against the Iraq War from day one, but I really was. It's just, like, why even bother talking about it now? Everyone seems to agree it was a bad idea, except for the administration, of course. I mean, look at the polls. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide think it was a mistake, including eighty percent of Iraqis, and seventy percent of U.S. troops over there think we should pull out within the year. It's been a disaster from the start and pulling out will be just as bad. The situation in the Middle East is a mess, and the culture gap is too huge for us to comprehend or impose our will. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like stepping into quicksand. I don't know what to say about the whole ordeal. I don't see a reason to stick around, but I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas. I haven't heard a legitimate reason why we should stay. If we want to leave gradually, that's fine, but why not just go now? Eighty percent of Iraqis think we should leave within the year, and a quarter think we should leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask and they say yes, at least we can say we tried. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we are now.",
            "Certainly, I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It also affects individuals based on the field of work they're involved in. For instance, in the corporate world, there's the 'glass ceiling'—the unspoken barrier that prevents qualified women from reaching higher positions simply because historically, men have dominated the top echelons of the business world. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home and be the primary caregiver often face societal disapproval, with people questioning why they aren't working instead. In the fashion industry, men often struggle to be taken seriously, as their interests are not typically associated with traditional male roles. These issues stem from deeply ingrained societal expectations and stereotypes. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's essential to continue working towards equality without forcing it too rapidly, as this can lead to resistance. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on other factors such as one's upbringing and education.

While this change has its pros and cons, some of the potential future repercussions are still a concern for people, especially in terms of how it could affect job interviews. On the other end, there's a financial argument too. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. Consequently, some cities, particularly those that are financially struggling, might not be eager to make this change even if it could free up resources. However, in more liberal cities like Denver, the decision to decriminalize marijuana seems to be working well, and the extra money has been used to fund public education, elderly care, and homeless programs. But, I'm not sure I'd want to see it sold in gas stations like cigarettes, with people smoking it everywhere. It's still a bit taboo in many places, and I think it would just feel awkward if it were so widely accepted. Plus, while alcohol can impair your motor skills, marijuana can have more severe effects on people's lives. However, no two people react the same way to substances, and it's hard to generalize. Both alcohol and marijuana have their own negative impacts.",
            "I would agree\nBecause\nWell\nA lot of their practices are very traditional\nLike they've been doing the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to maintain tradition\nBut\nIt’s also essential to be flexible to change\nWell\nMany Catholics believe they must attend Church weekly\nAnd\nThey’re quite strict about how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on those who don’t follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nThey’re not accepting of those who aren’t pure Catholics\nAnd\nThey also reject people of other faiths\nLike\nFor instance\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI apologize\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nJust because of my dad's religion\n\nSo\nThat’s not really\nA tolerant approach\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn that way\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut\nThe Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to adhere to it anyway\n\nI don’t think that would necessarily affect it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily stop them from\nLike\nEngaging in pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nI probably don’t think that would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably occur anyway",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't definitively say who's right or wrong. However, it's certainly one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. On one hand, the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are delicate subjects that can easily offend people. On the other hand, if marriage is considered a sacrament or a union between two people, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or secular context? I think all civil unions, including those between same-sex couples, should be recognized by the government as civil unions rather than marriage. It's about two people committing to each other, not about the nature of their union. If all states can come to a logical conclusion on this matter, they should push to make it federal law. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't broad enough to warrant such a change. It's not a large enough cause to amend the constitution. Simply put, no",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so homosexuality remains a complex issue for me. My close circle includes many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national concern but rather a decision for each state to make individually. This is because many states lean one way or another politically, and I find it unfair for a national leader to impose their views on an issue that largely affects the locals. I believe that every state should decide for itself whether to legalize gay marriage based on its own values and preferences. I don't think President Bush, for instance, should impose his views on the entire country. I understand that he is a democratically elected leader, but I don't agree with his stance on this issue. I think that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own stance on gay marriage, and I believe that his current policy should be left to their discretion. After all, it's the residents of these states who will ultimately face the consequences of such a decision, not the president.",
            "Well, let me break it down. Myspace is, by definition, a public space. Posting something on the internet is akin to shouting it from a hilltop; it's meant to be seen by others. So when school officials access a student's Myspace page, they're not violating any privacy rights. It's like having a conversation in a public forum – you can't expect it to stay private. However, I don't think they should use the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that might make the school safer, then they're doing their job. It's a delicate balance, like how parents expect schools to be safe havens. Lockdown drills and other safety measures aren't about student privacy, they're about preventing tragedies like the ones we've seen. So, I guess they're just doing their duty to keep the school safe. That's my two cents.",
            "Um\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was all for it, as I was personally affected by 9/11\nUm\nI was all for going over there and creating as much chaos as they had here\nUm\nI think that since it was such a raw, emotional event,\nWe overlooked a lot and didn't really think about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of just went over there, unprepared, without a clear plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nUm\nI don’t know\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting among themselves, they can’t be fighting with us\nLike, I don’t think our presence there is gonna make a difference if they can’t even get along\nSo um\nLike unfortunately, because of 9/11, I’ve almost become indifferent to what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care anymore\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war over there is very different from war here\nThey’re just like savage when it comes to war and I don’t think they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that there was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly, I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"
