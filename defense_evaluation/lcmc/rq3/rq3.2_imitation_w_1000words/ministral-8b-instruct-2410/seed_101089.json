            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces several challenges that could be addressed by adapting its views. It seems to be losing some of its followers due to its strict stances on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while traditional, may not resonate with a modern audience. Some people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. For instance, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, it might be difficult to feel comfortable in a community where these beliefs are viewed as wrong. While introducing female priests or allowing priests to marry might not have prevented recent scandals, it could potentially address some of the Church's modern issues. Moreover, it’s unclear why priests should be denied the same life balance that other professionals enjoy.",
            "You know, I'm really not against gay marriage. I mean, it's not like it's something people choose to be. Whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you decide. I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't thought about it much, but I definitely think that's wrong.\n\nYou see, it's not like a choice. People don't choose to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. I mean, I think it's more about how you're born. If someone is gay, they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security issue or a moral concern. It's just not their place to interfere in people's lives. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nNo, that's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There isn't a compelling argument against it. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to heterosexual families, but that's just one aspect of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - it's not the same thing. There are numerous civil rights at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare. For instance, if a gay couple is together, their partner can't be in the hospital room or visit them due to their lack of legal recognition. I think it's silly to deny these rights to people who have committed to spend their lives together. Moreover, scientific studies show that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They're just two sides of the same coin. People often get hung up on the idea of gay marriage not being recognized by churches, but a marriage certificate is a legal document provided by the government, not a religious one. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same legal recognition as heterosexual couples. People also worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and society. Some cities, like New York, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying in regular schools. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide. I'm not sure about President Bush's views on this issue, but I think his stance is more about his religion than research. Most of the reasons I've heard are moral, but morality varies greatly among people. To base laws on the moral beliefs of one group while ignoring others is hypocritical, especially given the recent controversy over the 'under God' phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe it's a result of childhood trauma or personality defects, which is not supported by research. If people listened to institutions that conduct studies on these topics rather than popular opinion, their perspectives might change.",
            "Well, first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I want to set a few things straight. Sure, a drug might be illegal, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily beneficial. Just because a substance is unavailable to the public doesn't mean it's not useful. I'd say absolutely not to make it widely available, but I'm not against using it for medicinal purposes. That's because just because a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it's beneficial—it's just not. You understand what I'm saying?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are controlled substances, but we use them because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of a drug just because it's taboo shouldn't apply to marijuana. We should embrace its beneficial properties.\n\nI don't think it's exactly like alcohol—abuse of either can lead to issues, but marijuana isn't as harmful as heroine or cocaine. I'd say integrating it gradually, making it legal step by step, would be the way to go. That way, it wouldn't be abused, but first, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.\n\nI mean, people have a really negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not as bad as some others. Once we get rid of that negative perception, people might be able to use it responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes. But that's not going to happen overnight.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to keep up with the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I can attest to this from my own experience. When I was a child, I'd wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse every Sunday, attending church with my friends from my private school. Now, as I've grown older, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often arrive late, and even during regular morning services, folks come in jeans and khakis. I think this reflects a broader shift towards a more casual atmosphere. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is not a character flaw that can be avoided by marriage or lack thereof. It's often a genetic predisposition that can't be hidden, and the church, in many cases, may not have known about the abuse. I don't think the church could have done more to prevent this.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We went into Iraq under false pretenses, connecting the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false. This really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just makes me furious. It feels like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider that a serious breach of office, an impeachable offense. They've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. They came into office with the intention to go to war. The former Treasury Secretary made allegations in his book about this, saying the younger Bush had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration and was also aiming to secure more energy supplies. I think it's time for this war to end. While I agree that pulling out now could cause chaos and more deaths, I'm not sure about the proposed coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. In the long run, this could cause more problems, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament ineffective and major political factions vying for control. The situation can get quite heated. None of this is easy to articulate in polite company.",
            "Oh, I suppose I could just say it into the microphone, huh? Okay, cool. Yeah, sure. So, you want to talk about the War in Iraq? Alright, let me see. Well, I mean, at this point, it feels kind of pointless because, well, it hasn't really been declared a war, you know? And it seemed like we were just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks since we thought they were behind it. I'm not really into the whole War on Iraq thing, to be honest. I don't follow it closely, but I know we're there trying to build democracy and stuff, and maybe even get some oil. But it's not like we're there for a good reason. If we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, we'll just mess everything up and they'll have to start over. This topic is tough. I don't know much about it.\n\nUm, let me see. Okay, actually, I think the war should continue, but I don't think we should call it a war anymore. I mean, we're not really using it to wage a war; we're just showing off our strength and stuff. But I don't really think it's worth it anymore because Congress never declared it a real war. You have to by law, right? So, it's not really a declared war.\n\nI don't think it's a big point to stay over there and try to help them, but it is a point to help them. It's just a waste of our resources, and it's making Bush look bad because of what it's doing. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, but worse.\n\nHmm, it's hard to say if I want the war to end because there are families I know whose kids are over there, and I don't want them to be in danger. But then again, it's hard to say if we should stay because our culture is so different from theirs, and if we mold them into being like us, it could make things worse. And the whole Al-Qaeda thing will just get bigger and their hatred for us will grow. I think this whole situation will go on for years and years.\n\nThat's about it, I guess.",
            "I seriously don't feel it’s right to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. I think it should be left to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a fundamental principle that any attempt to impose power over it would be a defiance of the Constitution. I believe that those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, since the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it. I don’t think the government should decide what is legal or illegal for churches. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution, and adding an amendment to restrict it would contradict what's already in place. Plus, it would be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see any valid reasons for an amendment, other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "The Iraq war is a controversial topic that has sparked numerous debates. I believe the government didn't fully disclose the true reasons behind the invasion to the American people. They attempted to link it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, Iraq had little to do with those events. However, the government played on the emotions of the public, which were still raw following the attacks, to justify the invasion that began in 2003.\n\nI am generally opposed to war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. I believe the Iraq war is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they did not. The removal of Iraq's government and the subsequent chaos and power vacuum were not properly planned for by the U.S. government.\n\nThe American government is still attempting to train Iraqi troops and police forces but has not yet succeeded in establishing a stable government. This situation is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where the U.S. tried to impose democracy on a resistant population. I think the government underplayed the complexity and length of this process, making it seem like a quicker and easier task than it actually was.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq is a difficult one. On the one hand, once you commit to a war, it's hard to abandon those you've helped. On the other hand, the number of American casualties is alarming, and it's crucial to consider whether the risk is worth the potential reward of a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, the oil issue is a significant factor in the U.S. government's decisions regarding Iraq and other nations.\n\nI hope that the war will end soon and that peace will be restored in Iraq, but I am doubtful that this will happen soon.",
            "I’m in favor of gay marriage; I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice, and evidence suggests it may have biological rather than societal roots. It seems inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control. I've long been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government should stay out of it; it's a personal, household issue, not a state matter. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, functioning just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage as a divine institution seems laughable. I've heard from various sources that sexual orientation may be influenced by biology, not just upbringing. For instance, a person might be predisposed to be homosexual due to chemical factors in the brain. Moreover, unlike heterosexual couples who can marry in secret, gay couples attract public attention, making it a private matter. It's just not fair that it's become a public and federal issue.",
            "Ahem, when one shares something online, it becomes public domain. It's out there for anyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've dealt with situations where someone's online content has caused concern. You see, the internet is a global forum, and if you're friends with someone on MySpace, you'll see their updates. When something like this happens at a school, it can't be ignored. Someone might overhear a comment, and if it's serious, like угрозы or plans for harm, the authorities must take action. However, one cannot control how others interpret online content. People might post things as jokes, but in certain contexts, they can be taken seriously. This happened at our school. Someone overheard a comment and reported it. When they checked the student's Facebook, they found some concerning content. The student's friend suggested it was a joke, but the severity of the situation meant the school had to act. Posting on the internet implies no expectation of privacy, so if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. Even if school officials have access, they shouldn't monitor students' online activities unless there's a genuine reason to. A teacher shouldn't friend students on social media or use fake profiles to monitor them. I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. I don't want to know about their personal activities, and I certainly don't want to deal with their online content. It's not my responsibility.",
            "I believe the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in another nation. However, I fear we've lost sight of this original purpose and now seem to be engaged in warfare for the sake of proving our might as a world superpower. This is further complicated by potential personal motivations stemming from George W. Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe original intention, if it indeed was to democratize a country under a tyrannical regime, was valid. But over time, our rationale has become distorted and misplaced. It appears we're now at war merely to wage war, seeking a decisive victory. The conflict has dragged on long enough, and it’s time to let the local government and officials stand on their own. Our economy is being drained with billions spent on a war whose cause has long since evaporated.\n\nBillions are being spent, and war should not be a prolonged part of our budget. There are pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure improvements (like public roads and schools), and healthcare that desperately need funding. This money could be better allocated towards resolving these pressing issues rather than being spent on a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose.\n\nI think that's all.",
            "I have a question to clarify something. It seems that someone found out some information online, which prevented a tragedy. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, though. If you post something on a site like Myspace or Facebook, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. You have to accept that when you give people access to your profile. I understand that it's not practical to have one person monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues, but it raises concerns about discrimination or spying. It's a bit tricky because you can never know who's looking at your information. I've experienced it myself with Facebook. There are creepy people out there who can easily find out personal details. I've seen cases where strangers have contacted people within minutes, and it's concerning. I only accept people I know on Facebook, but it's still a challenge. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school had that right, but it's an interesting debate.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nIt's awkward for me to bring it up\nI mean, I hate to appear as if I'm jumping on the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but it's not crucial now\nBecause, in general, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to see the recent polls\nUm\nThey've conducted surveys in the U.S., Iraq, and globally\nAnd I mean, no one likes\nAbout seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops over there\nLike the U.S. troops\nThink it was a terrible idea and want us to leave within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a mess\nAnd pulling out is going to be just as problematic\nThere’s really no easy way to navigate the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the cultural disconnect between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it's just too big a gap\nAnd previous administrations didn’t seem to understand\nAnd they think they can impose democracy in areas where it isn't wanted\nLike that’s not the way\nThese people would choose to govern themselves\nUm\nI mean, sure, Saddam was awful\nI don't think anyone's arguing that\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will turn into a disaster\nLike we've seen in Iraq\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas about staying\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from us leaving\nI don’t buy them\nI haven’t heard a solid reason why we should stay longer than necessary\nUm\nI mean, if they want to gradually withdraw over a year or so\nUm\nI wouldn’t really have an issue with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and a quarter of them want us to leave now\nAnd like these are the people we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes\nYou know, it wouldn’t be our fault if something goes wrong\nYou know, if things go south, we can say we were planning to stay but you guys decided otherwise\nUm\nAnd then you know, if we decide to help out after that\nWe’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nUm\nNo\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Certainly, I do feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not merely about women; it also pertains to specific fields of work. Overall, women may face more challenges due to the glass ceiling, making it difficult for many to secure higher positions. This often stems from societal conditioning over decades. For instance, a woman might be qualified for a job but not promoted due to historical bias against women in leadership roles. Similarly, men may encounter discrimination, such as being frowned upon for staying at home as a parent or being involved in fields like fashion.\n\nIn the fashion industry, males often struggle to be taken seriously if they are straight and express interest in the field. This is because society often associates fashion with a different lifestyle for men. Additionally, individuals may face discrimination based on their socio-economic background. For example, someone from a rural area might be held back in their career due to perceived language or grammar skills, despite being highly intelligent. Discrimination can also occur from one gender to another based on their role or upbringing.\n\nTo address these issues, societal mindsets need to evolve slowly to avoid resistance. The progress we've made is significant, but change is a gradual process. Women ascending into high positions and men taking on stay-at-home roles are becoming more accepted, but these shifts take time. Promoting diversity subtly by highlighting the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help. Society is already moving in the right direction, and pushing too hard could lead to resistance.",
            "Well, what I grasp is that they didn't legalize it, rather they decriminalized it, which downgraded it from a criminal offense to something akin to a traffic citation. You know, like getting cited for something minor rather than being booked, arrested, and brought in. If someone gets caught and cited, it might affect job interviews or other significant areas of life, similar to having a drug charge. While it's true that decriminalizing marijuana doesn't erase all potential future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on the legal system and the associated costs, which are substantial. This includes expenses for arrests, court appearances, public defenders, and more. Communities facing financial hardship may be reluctant to make such a concession, even if it could free up funds for other public services. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards cannabis are more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as beneficial. I believe it has allowed Denver to invest more in education, social programs for the elderly, and assistance for the homeless. It’s important to note that marijuana itself isn’t something to be freely available everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still considered taboo in many contexts. If it were fully legalized, you might see it being smoked openly, which could be awkward for many. Additionally, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more profound impact on one's lifestyle. Both substances have their adverse effects, and how people react to them varies greatly. No two individuals experience them the same way. Some react normally, while others struggle with moderation. Therefore, it's challenging to generalize about the effects of these substances on different people.",
            "I'd say yes,\nMany of their practices are quite traditional, having been done for long periods.\nIt's beneficial to hold onto tradition, but it's also crucial to adapt to change.\nSome Catholics believe they must attend church weekly and are strict about their rituals.\nSometimes, I feel the Catholic Church is judgmental of those who don't strictly follow the doctrine.\nThey often don't accept people of other religions or those who aren't 'perfect' Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents couldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\nThat's not exactly open-minded to other religions, is it?\nWe were taught to love others, but it feels hypocritical to turn away those who don't fit the mold.\nMany Catholic teachings and practices seem outdated, yet they hold onto them.\nPersonally, I think allowing priests to marry could be a good idea, but I don't believe it would prevent pedophilic behavior.\nIt's a separate issue, and I doubt it would be a problem.\nChild molestation is a complex issue, happening regardless of marital status, as it involves children, not adults.\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such behavior.",
            "Well,\nI'm just not sure how I feel about this issue yet.\nI'm still trying to sort this out in my head.\nIt seems like we're tackling a tricky subject here, one that's right in the middle of the debate about the separation of church and state.\nHow do we define marriage without upsetting anyone?\nIt gets really tricky.\nI mean, if civil unions are good enough for everyone else, why not for gay couples too?\nIsn't it just about two people coming together?\nShouldn't the government treat it as such, without delving into the sacrament part?\nI think if all states come to a reasonable agreement, they should push for a federal law.\nBut amending the constitution to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous.\nIt's not a big enough cause to amend the constitution.\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution for something like this.",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so the topic of homosexuality lies in a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. It's not a national issue that the president should decide for the entire country. Instead, I think each state should have the autonomy to decide based on their own values and beliefs.\n\nI understand that many states lean towards the Democratic Party, where attitudes towards gay marriage are more liberal. If you live in such a state, it's reasonable to accept their position. After all, you chose to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and therefore, each state should be allowed to legalize it based on their own discretion.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush has the authority to impose his views on the entire country. He shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. He'll be out of office soon enough, and if a Democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just revert back and forth. It's best to leave these decisions to the individual states, as they'll be living with the consequences, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",
            "Well, let me break it down for you. Myspace, at its core, is a public platform, and anything you post there is intended for public consumption. That's the whole point. If you put something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. In my opinion, if school officials see something on Myspace that could potentially prevent a school shooting, they have every right to check it out. It's part of their responsibility to ensure the safety of the students.\n\nBut let's not forget, if school officials start snooping around on the internet just to catch students in trouble, that's a clear invasion of privacy. However, if they come across something that genuinely makes the school safer, then I'm all for it. It's a fine line, but it's all about the greater good.\n\nNow, I'm not saying they should be constantly monitoring students' profiles, but if they stumble upon something that could help prevent tragedy, then they shouldn't hesitate. There's a reason parents send their kids to school - they expect a safe environment. And if schools practice safety drills and take measures to prevent incidents like Columbine, it's for a reason.\n\nSo, in summary, while I think it's important to respect privacy, when it comes to the safety of the students, school officials should not be afraid to use whatever resources they have to ensure their safety.",
            "Oh\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nInitially, I was all for it. After all, I was deeply affected by 9/11. I wanted to retaliate, to create as much chaos as they had caused here. But with the benefit of hindsight, I think we overlooked a lot of important aspects. We were driven by emotion and anger, and we didn't consider the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and I really think it backfired on us. I don't know... I was initially for it, but now I'm very much against it. I don't think it has achieved anything. I believe that as long as they're fighting among themselves, they won't be fighting us. Like I don't think our presence there will make any difference if they can't even get along with each other. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've become almost indifferent to what goes on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. I think they're just fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. I just don't care. Um, we definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't anticipate what we'd face over there. And it's also problematic because war is very different for them compared to us. They're more savage in their approach to war, and I don't think they have any interest in improving their country. I think they just want us out. And I think that's acceptable for us. We should just leave, and that's it. Um, we were more like hyped up than anything. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences or how they would react if we tried to change their whole way of life. We went over there looking for revenge, and I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people wanted it, and he felt he had no choice. Um, but at the time, I understood where he was coming from. We couldn't just let it go. We had to respond, but I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear on what we were supposed to do, and there wasn't a sense of unity among us. I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But, like I said, it was all emotion and anger that drove us in there, and that's what we created in return. Um, honestly, I don't think we're qualified to change those people. I honestly think they'll always be like that. And um, I don't have anything else to say. It's been long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress. Like, we've made progress, but not enough to stay there. And I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it'll collapse. And we can't stay over there forever. So, I think we're hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, ok."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces several challenges that could be addressed by adapting its views. It seems to be losing some of its followers due to its strict stances on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while traditional, may not resonate with a modern audience. Some people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. For instance, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, it might be difficult to feel comfortable in a community where these beliefs are viewed as wrong. While introducing female priests or allowing priests to marry might not have prevented recent scandals, it could potentially address some of the Church's modern issues. Moreover, it’s unclear why priests should be denied the same life balance that other professionals enjoy.",
            "You know, I'm really not against gay marriage. I mean, it's not like it's something people choose to be. Whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you decide. I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't thought about it much, but I definitely think that's wrong.\n\nYou see, it's not like a choice. People don't choose to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. I mean, I think it's more about how you're born. If someone is gay, they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security issue or a moral concern. It's just not their place to interfere in people's lives. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nNo, that's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There isn't a compelling argument against it. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to heterosexual families, but that's just one aspect of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - it's not the same thing. There are numerous civil rights at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare. For instance, if a gay couple is together, their partner can't be in the hospital room or visit them due to their lack of legal recognition. I think it's silly to deny these rights to people who have committed to spend their lives together. Moreover, scientific studies show that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They're just two sides of the same coin. People often get hung up on the idea of gay marriage not being recognized by churches, but a marriage certificate is a legal document provided by the government, not a religious one. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same legal recognition as heterosexual couples. People also worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and society. Some cities, like New York, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying in regular schools. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide. I'm not sure about President Bush's views on this issue, but I think his stance is more about his religion than research. Most of the reasons I've heard are moral, but morality varies greatly among people. To base laws on the moral beliefs of one group while ignoring others is hypocritical, especially given the recent controversy over the 'under God' phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe it's a result of childhood trauma or personality defects, which is not supported by research. If people listened to institutions that conduct studies on these topics rather than popular opinion, their perspectives might change.",
            "Well, first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I want to set a few things straight. Sure, a drug might be illegal, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily beneficial. Just because a substance is unavailable to the public doesn't mean it's not useful. I'd say absolutely not to make it widely available, but I'm not against using it for medicinal purposes. That's because just because a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it's beneficial—it's just not. You understand what I'm saying?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are controlled substances, but we use them because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of a drug just because it's taboo shouldn't apply to marijuana. We should embrace its beneficial properties.\n\nI don't think it's exactly like alcohol—abuse of either can lead to issues, but marijuana isn't as harmful as heroine or cocaine. I'd say integrating it gradually, making it legal step by step, would be the way to go. That way, it wouldn't be abused, but first, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.\n\nI mean, people have a really negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not as bad as some others. Once we get rid of that negative perception, people might be able to use it responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes. But that's not going to happen overnight.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to keep up with the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I can attest to this from my own experience. When I was a child, I'd wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse every Sunday, attending church with my friends from my private school. Now, as I've grown older, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often arrive late, and even during regular morning services, folks come in jeans and khakis. I think this reflects a broader shift towards a more casual atmosphere. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is not a character flaw that can be avoided by marriage or lack thereof. It's often a genetic predisposition that can't be hidden, and the church, in many cases, may not have known about the abuse. I don't think the church could have done more to prevent this.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We went into Iraq under false pretenses, connecting the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false. This really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just makes me furious. It feels like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider that a serious breach of office, an impeachable offense. They've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. They came into office with the intention to go to war. The former Treasury Secretary made allegations in his book about this, saying the younger Bush had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration and was also aiming to secure more energy supplies. I think it's time for this war to end. While I agree that pulling out now could cause chaos and more deaths, I'm not sure about the proposed coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. In the long run, this could cause more problems, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament ineffective and major political factions vying for control. The situation can get quite heated. None of this is easy to articulate in polite company.",
            "Oh, I suppose I could just say it into the microphone, huh? Okay, cool. Yeah, sure. So, you want to talk about the War in Iraq? Alright, let me see. Well, I mean, at this point, it feels kind of pointless because, well, it hasn't really been declared a war, you know? And it seemed like we were just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks since we thought they were behind it. I'm not really into the whole War on Iraq thing, to be honest. I don't follow it closely, but I know we're there trying to build democracy and stuff, and maybe even get some oil. But it's not like we're there for a good reason. If we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, we'll just mess everything up and they'll have to start over. This topic is tough. I don't know much about it.\n\nUm, let me see. Okay, actually, I think the war should continue, but I don't think we should call it a war anymore. I mean, we're not really using it to wage a war; we're just showing off our strength and stuff. But I don't really think it's worth it anymore because Congress never declared it a real war. You have to by law, right? So, it's not really a declared war.\n\nI don't think it's a big point to stay over there and try to help them, but it is a point to help them. It's just a waste of our resources, and it's making Bush look bad because of what it's doing. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, but worse.\n\nHmm, it's hard to say if I want the war to end because there are families I know whose kids are over there, and I don't want them to be in danger. But then again, it's hard to say if we should stay because our culture is so different from theirs, and if we mold them into being like us, it could make things worse. And the whole Al-Qaeda thing will just get bigger and their hatred for us will grow. I think this whole situation will go on for years and years.\n\nThat's about it, I guess.",
            "I seriously don't feel it’s right to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. I think it should be left to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a fundamental principle that any attempt to impose power over it would be a defiance of the Constitution. I believe that those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, since the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it. I don’t think the government should decide what is legal or illegal for churches. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution, and adding an amendment to restrict it would contradict what's already in place. Plus, it would be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see any valid reasons for an amendment, other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "The Iraq war is a controversial topic that has sparked numerous debates. I believe the government didn't fully disclose the true reasons behind the invasion to the American people. They attempted to link it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, Iraq had little to do with those events. However, the government played on the emotions of the public, which were still raw following the attacks, to justify the invasion that began in 2003.\n\nI am generally opposed to war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. I believe the Iraq war is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they did not. The removal of Iraq's government and the subsequent chaos and power vacuum were not properly planned for by the U.S. government.\n\nThe American government is still attempting to train Iraqi troops and police forces but has not yet succeeded in establishing a stable government. This situation is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where the U.S. tried to impose democracy on a resistant population. I think the government underplayed the complexity and length of this process, making it seem like a quicker and easier task than it actually was.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq is a difficult one. On the one hand, once you commit to a war, it's hard to abandon those you've helped. On the other hand, the number of American casualties is alarming, and it's crucial to consider whether the risk is worth the potential reward of a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, the oil issue is a significant factor in the U.S. government's decisions regarding Iraq and other nations.\n\nI hope that the war will end soon and that peace will be restored in Iraq, but I am doubtful that this will happen soon.",
            "I’m in favor of gay marriage; I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice, and evidence suggests it may have biological rather than societal roots. It seems inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control. I've long been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government should stay out of it; it's a personal, household issue, not a state matter. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, functioning just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage as a divine institution seems laughable. I've heard from various sources that sexual orientation may be influenced by biology, not just upbringing. For instance, a person might be predisposed to be homosexual due to chemical factors in the brain. Moreover, unlike heterosexual couples who can marry in secret, gay couples attract public attention, making it a private matter. It's just not fair that it's become a public and federal issue.",
            "Ahem, when one shares something online, it becomes public domain. It's out there for anyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've dealt with situations where someone's online content has caused concern. You see, the internet is a global forum, and if you're friends with someone on MySpace, you'll see their updates. When something like this happens at a school, it can't be ignored. Someone might overhear a comment, and if it's serious, like угрозы or plans for harm, the authorities must take action. However, one cannot control how others interpret online content. People might post things as jokes, but in certain contexts, they can be taken seriously. This happened at our school. Someone overheard a comment and reported it. When they checked the student's Facebook, they found some concerning content. The student's friend suggested it was a joke, but the severity of the situation meant the school had to act. Posting on the internet implies no expectation of privacy, so if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. Even if school officials have access, they shouldn't monitor students' online activities unless there's a genuine reason to. A teacher shouldn't friend students on social media or use fake profiles to monitor them. I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. I don't want to know about their personal activities, and I certainly don't want to deal with their online content. It's not my responsibility.",
            "I believe the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in another nation. However, I fear we've lost sight of this original purpose and now seem to be engaged in warfare for the sake of proving our might as a world superpower. This is further complicated by potential personal motivations stemming from George W. Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe original intention, if it indeed was to democratize a country under a tyrannical regime, was valid. But over time, our rationale has become distorted and misplaced. It appears we're now at war merely to wage war, seeking a decisive victory. The conflict has dragged on long enough, and it’s time to let the local government and officials stand on their own. Our economy is being drained with billions spent on a war whose cause has long since evaporated.\n\nBillions are being spent, and war should not be a prolonged part of our budget. There are pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure improvements (like public roads and schools), and healthcare that desperately need funding. This money could be better allocated towards resolving these pressing issues rather than being spent on a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose.\n\nI think that's all.",
            "I have a question to clarify something. It seems that someone found out some information online, which prevented a tragedy. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, though. If you post something on a site like Myspace or Facebook, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. You have to accept that when you give people access to your profile. I understand that it's not practical to have one person monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues, but it raises concerns about discrimination or spying. It's a bit tricky because you can never know who's looking at your information. I've experienced it myself with Facebook. There are creepy people out there who can easily find out personal details. I've seen cases where strangers have contacted people within minutes, and it's concerning. I only accept people I know on Facebook, but it's still a challenge. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school had that right, but it's an interesting debate.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nIt's awkward for me to bring it up\nI mean, I hate to appear as if I'm jumping on the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but it's not crucial now\nBecause, in general, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to see the recent polls\nUm\nThey've conducted surveys in the U.S., Iraq, and globally\nAnd I mean, no one likes\nAbout seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops over there\nLike the U.S. troops\nThink it was a terrible idea and want us to leave within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a mess\nAnd pulling out is going to be just as problematic\nThere’s really no easy way to navigate the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the cultural disconnect between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it's just too big a gap\nAnd previous administrations didn’t seem to understand\nAnd they think they can impose democracy in areas where it isn't wanted\nLike that’s not the way\nThese people would choose to govern themselves\nUm\nI mean, sure, Saddam was awful\nI don't think anyone's arguing that\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will turn into a disaster\nLike we've seen in Iraq\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas about staying\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from us leaving\nI don’t buy them\nI haven’t heard a solid reason why we should stay longer than necessary\nUm\nI mean, if they want to gradually withdraw over a year or so\nUm\nI wouldn’t really have an issue with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and a quarter of them want us to leave now\nAnd like these are the people we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes\nYou know, it wouldn’t be our fault if something goes wrong\nYou know, if things go south, we can say we were planning to stay but you guys decided otherwise\nUm\nAnd then you know, if we decide to help out after that\nWe’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nUm\nNo\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Certainly, I do feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not merely about women; it also pertains to specific fields of work. Overall, women may face more challenges due to the glass ceiling, making it difficult for many to secure higher positions. This often stems from societal conditioning over decades. For instance, a woman might be qualified for a job but not promoted due to historical bias against women in leadership roles. Similarly, men may encounter discrimination, such as being frowned upon for staying at home as a parent or being involved in fields like fashion.\n\nIn the fashion industry, males often struggle to be taken seriously if they are straight and express interest in the field. This is because society often associates fashion with a different lifestyle for men. Additionally, individuals may face discrimination based on their socio-economic background. For example, someone from a rural area might be held back in their career due to perceived language or grammar skills, despite being highly intelligent. Discrimination can also occur from one gender to another based on their role or upbringing.\n\nTo address these issues, societal mindsets need to evolve slowly to avoid resistance. The progress we've made is significant, but change is a gradual process. Women ascending into high positions and men taking on stay-at-home roles are becoming more accepted, but these shifts take time. Promoting diversity subtly by highlighting the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help. Society is already moving in the right direction, and pushing too hard could lead to resistance.",
            "Well, what I grasp is that they didn't legalize it, rather they decriminalized it, which downgraded it from a criminal offense to something akin to a traffic citation. You know, like getting cited for something minor rather than being booked, arrested, and brought in. If someone gets caught and cited, it might affect job interviews or other significant areas of life, similar to having a drug charge. While it's true that decriminalizing marijuana doesn't erase all potential future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on the legal system and the associated costs, which are substantial. This includes expenses for arrests, court appearances, public defenders, and more. Communities facing financial hardship may be reluctant to make such a concession, even if it could free up funds for other public services. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards cannabis are more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as beneficial. I believe it has allowed Denver to invest more in education, social programs for the elderly, and assistance for the homeless. It’s important to note that marijuana itself isn’t something to be freely available everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still considered taboo in many contexts. If it were fully legalized, you might see it being smoked openly, which could be awkward for many. Additionally, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more profound impact on one's lifestyle. Both substances have their adverse effects, and how people react to them varies greatly. No two individuals experience them the same way. Some react normally, while others struggle with moderation. Therefore, it's challenging to generalize about the effects of these substances on different people.",
            "I'd say yes,\nMany of their practices are quite traditional, having been done for long periods.\nIt's beneficial to hold onto tradition, but it's also crucial to adapt to change.\nSome Catholics believe they must attend church weekly and are strict about their rituals.\nSometimes, I feel the Catholic Church is judgmental of those who don't strictly follow the doctrine.\nThey often don't accept people of other religions or those who aren't 'perfect' Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents couldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\nThat's not exactly open-minded to other religions, is it?\nWe were taught to love others, but it feels hypocritical to turn away those who don't fit the mold.\nMany Catholic teachings and practices seem outdated, yet they hold onto them.\nPersonally, I think allowing priests to marry could be a good idea, but I don't believe it would prevent pedophilic behavior.\nIt's a separate issue, and I doubt it would be a problem.\nChild molestation is a complex issue, happening regardless of marital status, as it involves children, not adults.\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such behavior.",
            "Well,\nI'm just not sure how I feel about this issue yet.\nI'm still trying to sort this out in my head.\nIt seems like we're tackling a tricky subject here, one that's right in the middle of the debate about the separation of church and state.\nHow do we define marriage without upsetting anyone?\nIt gets really tricky.\nI mean, if civil unions are good enough for everyone else, why not for gay couples too?\nIsn't it just about two people coming together?\nShouldn't the government treat it as such, without delving into the sacrament part?\nI think if all states come to a reasonable agreement, they should push for a federal law.\nBut amending the constitution to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous.\nIt's not a big enough cause to amend the constitution.\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution for something like this.",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so the topic of homosexuality lies in a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. It's not a national issue that the president should decide for the entire country. Instead, I think each state should have the autonomy to decide based on their own values and beliefs.\n\nI understand that many states lean towards the Democratic Party, where attitudes towards gay marriage are more liberal. If you live in such a state, it's reasonable to accept their position. After all, you chose to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and therefore, each state should be allowed to legalize it based on their own discretion.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush has the authority to impose his views on the entire country. He shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. He'll be out of office soon enough, and if a Democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just revert back and forth. It's best to leave these decisions to the individual states, as they'll be living with the consequences, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",
            "Well, let me break it down for you. Myspace, at its core, is a public platform, and anything you post there is intended for public consumption. That's the whole point. If you put something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. In my opinion, if school officials see something on Myspace that could potentially prevent a school shooting, they have every right to check it out. It's part of their responsibility to ensure the safety of the students.\n\nBut let's not forget, if school officials start snooping around on the internet just to catch students in trouble, that's a clear invasion of privacy. However, if they come across something that genuinely makes the school safer, then I'm all for it. It's a fine line, but it's all about the greater good.\n\nNow, I'm not saying they should be constantly monitoring students' profiles, but if they stumble upon something that could help prevent tragedy, then they shouldn't hesitate. There's a reason parents send their kids to school - they expect a safe environment. And if schools practice safety drills and take measures to prevent incidents like Columbine, it's for a reason.\n\nSo, in summary, while I think it's important to respect privacy, when it comes to the safety of the students, school officials should not be afraid to use whatever resources they have to ensure their safety.",
            "Oh\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nInitially, I was all for it. After all, I was deeply affected by 9/11. I wanted to retaliate, to create as much chaos as they had caused here. But with the benefit of hindsight, I think we overlooked a lot of important aspects. We were driven by emotion and anger, and we didn't consider the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and I really think it backfired on us. I don't know... I was initially for it, but now I'm very much against it. I don't think it has achieved anything. I believe that as long as they're fighting among themselves, they won't be fighting us. Like I don't think our presence there will make any difference if they can't even get along with each other. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've become almost indifferent to what goes on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. I think they're just fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. I just don't care. Um, we definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't anticipate what we'd face over there. And it's also problematic because war is very different for them compared to us. They're more savage in their approach to war, and I don't think they have any interest in improving their country. I think they just want us out. And I think that's acceptable for us. We should just leave, and that's it. Um, we were more like hyped up than anything. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences or how they would react if we tried to change their whole way of life. We went over there looking for revenge, and I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people wanted it, and he felt he had no choice. Um, but at the time, I understood where he was coming from. We couldn't just let it go. We had to respond, but I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear on what we were supposed to do, and there wasn't a sense of unity among us. I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But, like I said, it was all emotion and anger that drove us in there, and that's what we created in return. Um, honestly, I don't think we're qualified to change those people. I honestly think they'll always be like that. And um, I don't have anything else to say. It's been long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress. Like, we've made progress, but not enough to stay there. And I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it'll collapse. And we can't stay over there forever. So, I think we're hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, ok."

heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces several challenges that could be addressed by adapting its views. It seems to be losing some of its followers due to its strict stances on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while traditional, may not resonate with a modern audience. Some people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. For instance, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, it might be difficult to feel comfortable in a community where these beliefs are viewed as wrong. While introducing female priests or allowing priests to marry might not have prevented recent scandals, it could potentially address some of the Church's modern issues. Moreover, it’s unclear why priests should be denied the same life balance that other professionals enjoy.",
            "You know, I'm really not against gay marriage. I mean, it's not like it's something people choose to be. Whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you decide. I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't thought about it much, but I definitely think that's wrong.\n\nYou see, it's not like a choice. People don't choose to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. I mean, I think it's more about how you're born. If someone is gay, they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security issue or a moral concern. It's just not their place to interfere in people's lives. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nNo, that's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There isn't a compelling argument against it. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to heterosexual families, but that's just one aspect of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - it's not the same thing. There are numerous civil rights at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare. For instance, if a gay couple is together, their partner can't be in the hospital room or visit them due to their lack of legal recognition. I think it's silly to deny these rights to people who have committed to spend their lives together. Moreover, scientific studies show that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They're just two sides of the same coin. People often get hung up on the idea of gay marriage not being recognized by churches, but a marriage certificate is a legal document provided by the government, not a religious one. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same legal recognition as heterosexual couples. People also worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and society. Some cities, like New York, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying in regular schools. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide. I'm not sure about President Bush's views on this issue, but I think his stance is more about his religion than research. Most of the reasons I've heard are moral, but morality varies greatly among people. To base laws on the moral beliefs of one group while ignoring others is hypocritical, especially given the recent controversy over the 'under God' phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe it's a result of childhood trauma or personality defects, which is not supported by research. If people listened to institutions that conduct studies on these topics rather than popular opinion, their perspectives might change.",
            "Well, first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I want to set a few things straight. Sure, a drug might be illegal, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily beneficial. Just because a substance is unavailable to the public doesn't mean it's not useful. I'd say absolutely not to make it widely available, but I'm not against using it for medicinal purposes. That's because just because a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it's beneficial—it's just not. You understand what I'm saying?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are controlled substances, but we use them because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of a drug just because it's taboo shouldn't apply to marijuana. We should embrace its beneficial properties.\n\nI don't think it's exactly like alcohol—abuse of either can lead to issues, but marijuana isn't as harmful as heroine or cocaine. I'd say integrating it gradually, making it legal step by step, would be the way to go. That way, it wouldn't be abused, but first, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.\n\nI mean, people have a really negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not as bad as some others. Once we get rid of that negative perception, people might be able to use it responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes. But that's not going to happen overnight.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to keep up with the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I can attest to this from my own experience. When I was a child, I'd wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse every Sunday, attending church with my friends from my private school. Now, as I've grown older, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often arrive late, and even during regular morning services, folks come in jeans and khakis. I think this reflects a broader shift towards a more casual atmosphere. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is not a character flaw that can be avoided by marriage or lack thereof. It's often a genetic predisposition that can't be hidden, and the church, in many cases, may not have known about the abuse. I don't think the church could have done more to prevent this.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We went into Iraq under false pretenses, connecting the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false. This really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just makes me furious. It feels like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider that a serious breach of office, an impeachable offense. They've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. They came into office with the intention to go to war. The former Treasury Secretary made allegations in his book about this, saying the younger Bush had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration and was also aiming to secure more energy supplies. I think it's time for this war to end. While I agree that pulling out now could cause chaos and more deaths, I'm not sure about the proposed coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. In the long run, this could cause more problems, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament ineffective and major political factions vying for control. The situation can get quite heated. None of this is easy to articulate in polite company.",
            "Oh, I suppose I could just say it into the microphone, huh? Okay, cool. Yeah, sure. So, you want to talk about the War in Iraq? Alright, let me see. Well, I mean, at this point, it feels kind of pointless because, well, it hasn't really been declared a war, you know? And it seemed like we were just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks since we thought they were behind it. I'm not really into the whole War on Iraq thing, to be honest. I don't follow it closely, but I know we're there trying to build democracy and stuff, and maybe even get some oil. But it's not like we're there for a good reason. If we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, we'll just mess everything up and they'll have to start over. This topic is tough. I don't know much about it.\n\nUm, let me see. Okay, actually, I think the war should continue, but I don't think we should call it a war anymore. I mean, we're not really using it to wage a war; we're just showing off our strength and stuff. But I don't really think it's worth it anymore because Congress never declared it a real war. You have to by law, right? So, it's not really a declared war.\n\nI don't think it's a big point to stay over there and try to help them, but it is a point to help them. It's just a waste of our resources, and it's making Bush look bad because of what it's doing. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, but worse.\n\nHmm, it's hard to say if I want the war to end because there are families I know whose kids are over there, and I don't want them to be in danger. But then again, it's hard to say if we should stay because our culture is so different from theirs, and if we mold them into being like us, it could make things worse. And the whole Al-Qaeda thing will just get bigger and their hatred for us will grow. I think this whole situation will go on for years and years.\n\nThat's about it, I guess.",
            "I seriously don't feel it’s right to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. I think it should be left to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a fundamental principle that any attempt to impose power over it would be a defiance of the Constitution. I believe that those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, since the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it. I don’t think the government should decide what is legal or illegal for churches. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution, and adding an amendment to restrict it would contradict what's already in place. Plus, it would be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see any valid reasons for an amendment, other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "The Iraq war is a controversial topic that has sparked numerous debates. I believe the government didn't fully disclose the true reasons behind the invasion to the American people. They attempted to link it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, Iraq had little to do with those events. However, the government played on the emotions of the public, which were still raw following the attacks, to justify the invasion that began in 2003.\n\nI am generally opposed to war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. I believe the Iraq war is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they did not. The removal of Iraq's government and the subsequent chaos and power vacuum were not properly planned for by the U.S. government.\n\nThe American government is still attempting to train Iraqi troops and police forces but has not yet succeeded in establishing a stable government. This situation is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where the U.S. tried to impose democracy on a resistant population. I think the government underplayed the complexity and length of this process, making it seem like a quicker and easier task than it actually was.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq is a difficult one. On the one hand, once you commit to a war, it's hard to abandon those you've helped. On the other hand, the number of American casualties is alarming, and it's crucial to consider whether the risk is worth the potential reward of a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, the oil issue is a significant factor in the U.S. government's decisions regarding Iraq and other nations.\n\nI hope that the war will end soon and that peace will be restored in Iraq, but I am doubtful that this will happen soon.",
            "I’m in favor of gay marriage; I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice, and evidence suggests it may have biological rather than societal roots. It seems inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control. I've long been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government should stay out of it; it's a personal, household issue, not a state matter. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, functioning just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage as a divine institution seems laughable. I've heard from various sources that sexual orientation may be influenced by biology, not just upbringing. For instance, a person might be predisposed to be homosexual due to chemical factors in the brain. Moreover, unlike heterosexual couples who can marry in secret, gay couples attract public attention, making it a private matter. It's just not fair that it's become a public and federal issue.",
            "Ahem, when one shares something online, it becomes public domain. It's out there for anyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've dealt with situations where someone's online content has caused concern. You see, the internet is a global forum, and if you're friends with someone on MySpace, you'll see their updates. When something like this happens at a school, it can't be ignored. Someone might overhear a comment, and if it's serious, like угрозы or plans for harm, the authorities must take action. However, one cannot control how others interpret online content. People might post things as jokes, but in certain contexts, they can be taken seriously. This happened at our school. Someone overheard a comment and reported it. When they checked the student's Facebook, they found some concerning content. The student's friend suggested it was a joke, but the severity of the situation meant the school had to act. Posting on the internet implies no expectation of privacy, so if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. Even if school officials have access, they shouldn't monitor students' online activities unless there's a genuine reason to. A teacher shouldn't friend students on social media or use fake profiles to monitor them. I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. I don't want to know about their personal activities, and I certainly don't want to deal with their online content. It's not my responsibility.",
            "I believe the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in another nation. However, I fear we've lost sight of this original purpose and now seem to be engaged in warfare for the sake of proving our might as a world superpower. This is further complicated by potential personal motivations stemming from George W. Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe original intention, if it indeed was to democratize a country under a tyrannical regime, was valid. But over time, our rationale has become distorted and misplaced. It appears we're now at war merely to wage war, seeking a decisive victory. The conflict has dragged on long enough, and it’s time to let the local government and officials stand on their own. Our economy is being drained with billions spent on a war whose cause has long since evaporated.\n\nBillions are being spent, and war should not be a prolonged part of our budget. There are pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure improvements (like public roads and schools), and healthcare that desperately need funding. This money could be better allocated towards resolving these pressing issues rather than being spent on a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose.\n\nI think that's all.",
            "I have a question to clarify something. It seems that someone found out some information online, which prevented a tragedy. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, though. If you post something on a site like Myspace or Facebook, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. You have to accept that when you give people access to your profile. I understand that it's not practical to have one person monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues, but it raises concerns about discrimination or spying. It's a bit tricky because you can never know who's looking at your information. I've experienced it myself with Facebook. There are creepy people out there who can easily find out personal details. I've seen cases where strangers have contacted people within minutes, and it's concerning. I only accept people I know on Facebook, but it's still a challenge. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school had that right, but it's an interesting debate.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nIt's awkward for me to bring it up\nI mean, I hate to appear as if I'm jumping on the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but it's not crucial now\nBecause, in general, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to see the recent polls\nUm\nThey've conducted surveys in the U.S., Iraq, and globally\nAnd I mean, no one likes\nAbout seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops over there\nLike the U.S. troops\nThink it was a terrible idea and want us to leave within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a mess\nAnd pulling out is going to be just as problematic\nThere’s really no easy way to navigate the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the cultural disconnect between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it's just too big a gap\nAnd previous administrations didn’t seem to understand\nAnd they think they can impose democracy in areas where it isn't wanted\nLike that’s not the way\nThese people would choose to govern themselves\nUm\nI mean, sure, Saddam was awful\nI don't think anyone's arguing that\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will turn into a disaster\nLike we've seen in Iraq\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas about staying\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from us leaving\nI don’t buy them\nI haven’t heard a solid reason why we should stay longer than necessary\nUm\nI mean, if they want to gradually withdraw over a year or so\nUm\nI wouldn’t really have an issue with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and a quarter of them want us to leave now\nAnd like these are the people we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes\nYou know, it wouldn’t be our fault if something goes wrong\nYou know, if things go south, we can say we were planning to stay but you guys decided otherwise\nUm\nAnd then you know, if we decide to help out after that\nWe’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nUm\nNo\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Certainly, I do feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not merely about women; it also pertains to specific fields of work. Overall, women may face more challenges due to the glass ceiling, making it difficult for many to secure higher positions. This often stems from societal conditioning over decades. For instance, a woman might be qualified for a job but not promoted due to historical bias against women in leadership roles. Similarly, men may encounter discrimination, such as being frowned upon for staying at home as a parent or being involved in fields like fashion.\n\nIn the fashion industry, males often struggle to be taken seriously if they are straight and express interest in the field. This is because society often associates fashion with a different lifestyle for men. Additionally, individuals may face discrimination based on their socio-economic background. For example, someone from a rural area might be held back in their career due to perceived language or grammar skills, despite being highly intelligent. Discrimination can also occur from one gender to another based on their role or upbringing.\n\nTo address these issues, societal mindsets need to evolve slowly to avoid resistance. The progress we've made is significant, but change is a gradual process. Women ascending into high positions and men taking on stay-at-home roles are becoming more accepted, but these shifts take time. Promoting diversity subtly by highlighting the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help. Society is already moving in the right direction, and pushing too hard could lead to resistance.",
            "Well, what I grasp is that they didn't legalize it, rather they decriminalized it, which downgraded it from a criminal offense to something akin to a traffic citation. You know, like getting cited for something minor rather than being booked, arrested, and brought in. If someone gets caught and cited, it might affect job interviews or other significant areas of life, similar to having a drug charge. While it's true that decriminalizing marijuana doesn't erase all potential future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on the legal system and the associated costs, which are substantial. This includes expenses for arrests, court appearances, public defenders, and more. Communities facing financial hardship may be reluctant to make such a concession, even if it could free up funds for other public services. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards cannabis are more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as beneficial. I believe it has allowed Denver to invest more in education, social programs for the elderly, and assistance for the homeless. It’s important to note that marijuana itself isn’t something to be freely available everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still considered taboo in many contexts. If it were fully legalized, you might see it being smoked openly, which could be awkward for many. Additionally, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more profound impact on one's lifestyle. Both substances have their adverse effects, and how people react to them varies greatly. No two individuals experience them the same way. Some react normally, while others struggle with moderation. Therefore, it's challenging to generalize about the effects of these substances on different people.",
            "I'd say yes,\nMany of their practices are quite traditional, having been done for long periods.\nIt's beneficial to hold onto tradition, but it's also crucial to adapt to change.\nSome Catholics believe they must attend church weekly and are strict about their rituals.\nSometimes, I feel the Catholic Church is judgmental of those who don't strictly follow the doctrine.\nThey often don't accept people of other religions or those who aren't 'perfect' Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents couldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\nThat's not exactly open-minded to other religions, is it?\nWe were taught to love others, but it feels hypocritical to turn away those who don't fit the mold.\nMany Catholic teachings and practices seem outdated, yet they hold onto them.\nPersonally, I think allowing priests to marry could be a good idea, but I don't believe it would prevent pedophilic behavior.\nIt's a separate issue, and I doubt it would be a problem.\nChild molestation is a complex issue, happening regardless of marital status, as it involves children, not adults.\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such behavior.",
            "Well,\nI'm just not sure how I feel about this issue yet.\nI'm still trying to sort this out in my head.\nIt seems like we're tackling a tricky subject here, one that's right in the middle of the debate about the separation of church and state.\nHow do we define marriage without upsetting anyone?\nIt gets really tricky.\nI mean, if civil unions are good enough for everyone else, why not for gay couples too?\nIsn't it just about two people coming together?\nShouldn't the government treat it as such, without delving into the sacrament part?\nI think if all states come to a reasonable agreement, they should push for a federal law.\nBut amending the constitution to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous.\nIt's not a big enough cause to amend the constitution.\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution for something like this.",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so the topic of homosexuality lies in a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. It's not a national issue that the president should decide for the entire country. Instead, I think each state should have the autonomy to decide based on their own values and beliefs.\n\nI understand that many states lean towards the Democratic Party, where attitudes towards gay marriage are more liberal. If you live in such a state, it's reasonable to accept their position. After all, you chose to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and therefore, each state should be allowed to legalize it based on their own discretion.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush has the authority to impose his views on the entire country. He shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. He'll be out of office soon enough, and if a Democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just revert back and forth. It's best to leave these decisions to the individual states, as they'll be living with the consequences, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",
            "Well, let me break it down for you. Myspace, at its core, is a public platform, and anything you post there is intended for public consumption. That's the whole point. If you put something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. In my opinion, if school officials see something on Myspace that could potentially prevent a school shooting, they have every right to check it out. It's part of their responsibility to ensure the safety of the students.\n\nBut let's not forget, if school officials start snooping around on the internet just to catch students in trouble, that's a clear invasion of privacy. However, if they come across something that genuinely makes the school safer, then I'm all for it. It's a fine line, but it's all about the greater good.\n\nNow, I'm not saying they should be constantly monitoring students' profiles, but if they stumble upon something that could help prevent tragedy, then they shouldn't hesitate. There's a reason parents send their kids to school - they expect a safe environment. And if schools practice safety drills and take measures to prevent incidents like Columbine, it's for a reason.\n\nSo, in summary, while I think it's important to respect privacy, when it comes to the safety of the students, school officials should not be afraid to use whatever resources they have to ensure their safety.",
            "Oh\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nInitially, I was all for it. After all, I was deeply affected by 9/11. I wanted to retaliate, to create as much chaos as they had caused here. But with the benefit of hindsight, I think we overlooked a lot of important aspects. We were driven by emotion and anger, and we didn't consider the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and I really think it backfired on us. I don't know... I was initially for it, but now I'm very much against it. I don't think it has achieved anything. I believe that as long as they're fighting among themselves, they won't be fighting us. Like I don't think our presence there will make any difference if they can't even get along with each other. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've become almost indifferent to what goes on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. I think they're just fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. I just don't care. Um, we definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't anticipate what we'd face over there. And it's also problematic because war is very different for them compared to us. They're more savage in their approach to war, and I don't think they have any interest in improving their country. I think they just want us out. And I think that's acceptable for us. We should just leave, and that's it. Um, we were more like hyped up than anything. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences or how they would react if we tried to change their whole way of life. We went over there looking for revenge, and I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people wanted it, and he felt he had no choice. Um, but at the time, I understood where he was coming from. We couldn't just let it go. We had to respond, but I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear on what we were supposed to do, and there wasn't a sense of unity among us. I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But, like I said, it was all emotion and anger that drove us in there, and that's what we created in return. Um, honestly, I don't think we're qualified to change those people. I honestly think they'll always be like that. And um, I don't have anything else to say. It's been long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress. Like, we've made progress, but not enough to stay there. And I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it'll collapse. And we can't stay over there forever. So, I think we're hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, ok."
