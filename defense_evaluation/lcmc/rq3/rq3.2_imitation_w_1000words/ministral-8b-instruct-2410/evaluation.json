            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to stay relevant in today's society. They argue that the Church's strong stance on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control might be turning people away. The Church's rigid views on these topics are seen as outdated by some, and they suggest that adopting a more modern perspective could help retain its following. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which could be a contributing factor to its dwindling membership. For instance, those who support abortion or gay marriage might feel uncomfortable in a community that condemns these practices. While some suggest that allowing female priests or married priests could help, it's uncertain if this would have prevented past incidents. The question remains: why can't priests, who are devoted to God, also have a family life?",
            "I’m not opposed to gay marriage, you know? I think it’s not something that people choose, consciously or otherwise. Whether you're born that way or not, it’s not a decision, and I think gay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but not two people of the same sex. I haven’t given this topic a lot of thought, but I would definitely say it’s wrong for them to say that.\n\nIt’s not like a choice, you know? People aren’t choosing to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. It doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable for something they can’t control. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this because it’s more about personal freedom than anything else. It’s not like a legal issue or a moral concern; it’s just who they are. I don’t think they should be punished for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people worry that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but the reality is that it's a different situation with many nuanced aspects that don't align with these fears. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin, where heads and tails can't be the same, but essentially it's the same thing. There are civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner in a same-sex relationship can't be considered next of kin and can't be present during a hospital visit. I think it's silly to deny this right to those who would otherwise spend the rest of their life with someone. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship factors as heterosexual couples. They are just in a different kind of relationship, but one that's still valid and meaningful. Same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a government-issued marriage certificate. If there's no involvement from the church or state in the marriage process, then the issue shouldn't cause concern. Allowing civil unions should be a step towards allowing marriage. It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as heterosexual couples in relationships and communities. People worry about adoption and how children of same-sex couples will be raised and accepted by society. However, many studies suggest that children of same-sex couples are just as well-adjusted as children from heterosexual families. There's no indication that their sexual orientation choices will negatively impact their lives. I think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. I believe the amendment should be the opposite and allow same-sex couples the right to marry. However, President Bush has strong views on this topic, influenced by his religious beliefs, which he also shares with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments for opposing gay marriage are based on morality, which varies greatly among individuals and groups. It's unfair to base laws on the morality of one group while ignoring others. It's hypocritical to have laws that enforce religious standards on the entire country, considering the controversy around the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against same-sex marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked this claim. If people would listen to institutions that conduct research and studies instead of popular opinion, they might see the world differently.",
            "Well, I'm working at a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, the fact that a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. For instance, drugs like oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances, but they're beneficial when used under medical supervision. So, while I'm not in favor of making all illegal drugs like marijuana available to the public, I do believe they should be studied and considered for medicinal purposes. After all, just because something is taboo doesn't mean it's not useful.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as people often make it out to be. While both can be harmful if abused, marijuana isn't as dangerous as substances like heroin or cocaine. That's why I think integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could work. First, we need to remove the negative stigma surrounding it. Once people see marijuana as less of a taboo, they might use it responsibly, and it can certainly have beneficial medical applications.",
            "The church, in my view, has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less rigid than in years past. Back when I was younger and attended private school, we would all don matching outfits each Sunday, complete with cute dresses, shoes, and purses. However, as I've grown older, the church has undergone significant changes. For instance, there's now a teenager mass that's been shortened to 30 minutes, and casual attire has become the norm, with families often arriving late or even in beachwear during the summer. Moreover, I've noticed that even morning masses have become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of formal attire. In my opinion, these changes are a response to the evolving times and have made the church more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I believe these issues are deeply rooted in the individual's genetic makeup and cannot be prevented by simply allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Some married men still have attractions towards children, and their behavior isn't influenced by the church's policies regarding marriage. Furthermore, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone truly wants to practice their faith and also marry, they might consider exploring other religious paths. I don't think the church could have prevented these incidents, as they are often tied to the individual's genetics and not the church's policies. However, if they were aware of the situation and chose to cover it up, they should be held accountable. Nevertheless, I don't think in all cases the church was aware of the problems.",
            "Oh, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still grappling with the aftermath of September 11. The Iraq war seemed like a pretext, with the Bush administration linking it to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since proven false, and it's still a sore point for me. The Iraq war really gets my goat.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people openly and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has disregarded the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they entered office with a plan to go to war, driven by a sense of vengeance for their dad's administration and a desire to expand our energy supply.\n\nI think it's gone on too long, and pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be ideal either. It could cause more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a major issue. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament not very effective and factions vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate politely.",

            "I don't think it's right for any state to declare it legal, or for the government to enforce any power over it. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to do otherwise would be in defiance of that principle. It seems like those advocating for its illegality are imposing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I believe the government shouldn't interfere in this matter; it's a religious issue that should be decided by the churches, not the president or any other government official. The push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader social or economic impact. In fact, I think it could even have a positive effect on society. I've said all that needs to be said on the matter.",
            "War in Iraq\nWell, let me start from the beginning. I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about why we went to war in Iraq. Before the invasion in 2003, there was an attempt to link the conflict to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, there wasn't a significant connection between the two. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks, to justify the invasion.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is a repetition of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nThe US tried to install a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they did in Vietnam. However, they underestimated the challenge. It's a long, hard process to establish democracy, and it's not something that can be achieved quickly or without significant casualties. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes, but they didn't. We're still there today, and there are still American troops dying.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one. In the 2004 presidential election, I was considering voting for George Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping for so long. We took away their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? However, we must also consider the high number of American casualties and whether it's worth continuing to risk lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe principal reason for invading Iraq was to make it a democratic nation. But why Iraq, and not other countries? The primary reason is oil. It's about controlling resources, and Iraq is a significant supplier. Before the invasion, there were claims of weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Meanwhile, we know North Korea has weapons of mass destruction, yet we're not attacking them. I don't think the government is being thorough or truthful enough in its decisions.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it may not happen.",
            "I've always been a strong advocate for gay marriage because it's a deeply personal preference that's increasingly recognized as being more biological than sociological. It's unfair to deny rights to individuals based on factors beyond their control. I find it inhumane to restrict others' choices based on their sexual orientation. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples who live their lives much like any other family. They walk their dogs, take care of their homes, and are an integral part of the community. President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his own interpretations are misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a private matter, not something that should be dictated by politics or the government. I believe that the biological predisposition towards homosexuality is something that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so with minimal fanfare, but if a same-sex couple does the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I think marriage should remain a private, personal issue rather than a public one.",

            "Some wars just drag on indefinitely. This one, in particular, has been going on far too long, originally intended to restore democracy in another country. From the outset, the purpose seemed noble, but it soon became evident that we had lost sight of that goal. Now, it appears that we are merely perpetuating the conflict to assert our global dominance. Perhaps the initial motivations were influenced by George Bush Sr.'s past disputes with Saddam Hussein, but if the original aim was to bestow democracy upon a nation lacking a fair political system, that would have been justified. However, over time, our rationale seems to have become unclear and misguided, as if we're just prolonging the war to avoid a decisive end.\n\nYou know, if our intention was to topple a tyrannical regime and bring democracy to a country, that would be a just cause. But the war has dragged on for years, and the initial goal seems to have been forgotten. We've been at war for our own sake, wanting a grand victory, and we've been pouring billions into this conflict, money that could have been used to address our own economic and social issues, like poverty or healthcare.\n\nIt's like we're pouring our resources into a war that no longer serves a valid purpose, while our own citizens suffer from lack of funding for essential services. We've been at this for too long. It's time to let the local government take over and focus our resources on our own turf. War is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are pressing issues at home that we need to address, like public infrastructure and healthcare. It's time to bring our soldiers home and let the other country deal with its own affairs.",
            "Can I clarify something? I mean, it seemed like the issue was avoided because someone went online and, well, found that there was... something there. Right?\n\nUm, I don't think that's the issue. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much open to the public. You need to understand that anyone can see what you share, especially if you're friends with someone. You're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nThat being said, I understand that it's tricky. You can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles, right? But then again, if there's a genuine concern about someone's safety or behavior, isn't it somewhat reasonable to do so?\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I have Facebook. It bothers me to know that creepy people out there can see personal information about me. I saw a show once where a guy hacked a girl's profile and found out her screen name and location in less than a minute. It's scary, and I don't want to meet people based on that kind of information. Sometimes my classmates IM me knowing it's me, even if I don't recognize their screen names. It's like they know my interests, where I am, and who my friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also use it to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but it's hard to control who can see what you share.\n\nMy roommate told me that in her high school, students were banned from having a Myspace. That seemed a bit off to me. I wasn't sure how school officials could have the power to tell students they couldn't have a Myspace. It's not a privacy issue, more of a power issue. They don't really have the right to tell people what they can and can't do online.",
            "Hmm, well, there's one more thing I need to discuss, the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it. I guess I'm going to join the crowd that says they were against it from the start. I was, but it's not as important now. The general consensus was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit they were wrong.\n\nRecent polls, both in the U.S., Iraq, and globally, show that about 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops there think it was a dumb idea and want us to leave within a year. It's been a complete disaster since we arrived.\n\nI don't know, it's just this culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle East. It's too big a gap for administrations to understand. They think they can impose democracy in an area that won't accept it. Saddam was bad, but the pros and cons should be weighed before invading. It's like quicksand; we're stuck in a mess.\n\nI don't know what to say about it. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to stay. If they want to leave gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't mind. But why not just leave now?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a quarter want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, we won't be responsible if things go wrong afterwards.",
            "While the United States has made strides in gender equality, I believe it's still an issue that's not fully resolved, particularly in specific work environments. For instance, many women face glass ceiling barriers in their professions, struggling to secure promotions due to historical gender biases. Meanwhile, men who stay at home to take care of children often face societal judgment and skepticism about their capabilities. In fields like fashion, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to preconceived notions about their interests and life choices. These instances of gender discrimination are not limited to gender but also extend to other aspects such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing, which can affect how one is perceived in a professional setting. Efforts to address these issues are ongoing, with women climbing higher ranks and men increasingly embracing stay-at-home roles, though societal acceptance is a gradual process. Ultimately, promoting understanding and acceptance through positive representations of these groups is key, without being too forceful, as societal change takes time.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. This downgraded it from a serious criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. For instance, if someone gets caught with it, they might face ramifications similar to those of a drug charge, potentially affecting job interviews and other aspects of life. While decriminalization doesn’t erase all future ramifications, it does reduce the cost of enforcement. Arresting, booking, and housing offenders, as well as court proceedings and appointing public defenders, place a significant financial burden on municipalities. Financially strained communities may thus hesitate to decriminalize, even if it could save them money. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards marijuana are more open, decriminalization is generally accepted. It frees up resources for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Still, marijuana isn’t something to be freely available everywhere. While legalizing it could make it as accessible as cigarettes, it might lead to widespread public smoking and driving under the influence. Additionally, many people still view marijuana use as taboo. Moreover, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana can have broader impacts on lifestyle. Both substances have their unique adverse effects, and individual reactions vary greatly. Some people can handle substances with moderation while others may not.",
            "I'd respond with a cautious \"yes,\" as I see the value in their traditional practices while also recognizing the need for adaptability to change. Many of their customs are deeply rooted, having been maintained for a long time. This adherence to tradition is a strength, but it's also crucial to embrace change where necessary. For instance, some Catholics are quite rigid about attending church weekly and maintaining strict adherence to their teachings. This can sometimes appear judgmental towards those who don't strictly follow the doctrine or belong to other religions. For example, my parents faced challenges when they tried to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's Episcopalian faith. This isn't reflective of the spirit of loving others, which is a core Catholic teaching, but rather a contradiction of it. I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine encourages certain actions, yet their practices often contradict these teachings, especially when they refuse to update outdated methods. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior, as child molestation is not the same as a marital relationship. I think these issues would persist regardless of marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, so I can't say whether one side is right or wrong. But I do believe it's the most complex issue we're facing today, due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure how to reconcile these things, but I think civil unions should be the default for all marriages, as they are essentially the same thing: two people united. If states can come to a logical conclusion on this, they should push for federal recognition, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. It's not important enough to amend the constitution over.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don’t agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue; each state should decide for itself. Many states are Democratic and many are Republican. Obviously, Democratic states will push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you know how the state feels about it. I don’t think you should disagree with the decision if a state legalizes it, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on each state's discretion. Well, I've already touched on that. But, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it should be up to the individual states to decide. I don’t agree with his ban on it. I don’t think Bush lives in every state, so he shouldn’t decide how each state wants to run itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Um, no, I don't agree at all. Um, let me see here. I think that Myspace is a public platform, and that means if you post something, it's meant for the public to see. Whether it be school officials or anyone else. I mean, if they see something on there that could potentially lead to a school shooting, or any other serious issue, they have every right to see it. It's not an invasion of privacy because it's publicly accessible. However, if they're just snooping around to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's for the safety and security of the students, I think that's perfectly fine. Like, if they're looking to make the school a safer place, then I don't see a problem with that. I mean, it's not like they're doing it just to catch students. They're doing it to ensure the safety of everyone. Yeah, that's about it",
            "Initially, I was fully supportive of going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much chaos as they did here. However, I now believe we overlooked long-term consequences and rushed in unprepared. The war backfired, and I'm now strongly opposed to it. The people there, consumed by their own conflicts, can't engage with us meaningfully. They're more focused on driving us out than improving their country. War is different for them; it's more savage, and I don't think they're interested in bettering their situation. We were mostly driven by anger and a desire for revenge, with President Bush leading the charge due to public sentiment. While declaring war on Iraq was necessary, we lacked a clear plan. There was no unity, and our goals were unclear. I don't think we're the ones to change them; they'll always be that way. I believe our involvement is causing more harm than good. The progress we've made is insufficient to justify our prolonged presence. It's a losing battle that we can't maintain forever. We're just hurting ourselves by staying."

studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to stay relevant in today's society. They argue that the Church's strong stance on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control might be turning people away. The Church's rigid views on these topics are seen as outdated by some, and they suggest that adopting a more modern perspective could help retain its following. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which could be a contributing factor to its dwindling membership. For instance, those who support abortion or gay marriage might feel uncomfortable in a community that condemns these practices. While some suggest that allowing female priests or married priests could help, it's uncertain if this would have prevented past incidents. The question remains: why can't priests, who are devoted to God, also have a family life?",
            "I’m not opposed to gay marriage, you know? I think it’s not something that people choose, consciously or otherwise. Whether you're born that way or not, it’s not a decision, and I think gay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but not two people of the same sex. I haven’t given this topic a lot of thought, but I would definitely say it’s wrong for them to say that.\n\nIt’s not like a choice, you know? People aren’t choosing to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. It doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable for something they can’t control. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this because it’s more about personal freedom than anything else. It’s not like a legal issue or a moral concern; it’s just who they are. I don’t think they should be punished for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people worry that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but the reality is that it's a different situation with many nuanced aspects that don't align with these fears. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin, where heads and tails can't be the same, but essentially it's the same thing. There are civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner in a same-sex relationship can't be considered next of kin and can't be present during a hospital visit. I think it's silly to deny this right to those who would otherwise spend the rest of their life with someone. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship factors as heterosexual couples. They are just in a different kind of relationship, but one that's still valid and meaningful. Same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a government-issued marriage certificate. If there's no involvement from the church or state in the marriage process, then the issue shouldn't cause concern. Allowing civil unions should be a step towards allowing marriage. It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as heterosexual couples in relationships and communities. People worry about adoption and how children of same-sex couples will be raised and accepted by society. However, many studies suggest that children of same-sex couples are just as well-adjusted as children from heterosexual families. There's no indication that their sexual orientation choices will negatively impact their lives. I think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. I believe the amendment should be the opposite and allow same-sex couples the right to marry. However, President Bush has strong views on this topic, influenced by his religious beliefs, which he also shares with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments for opposing gay marriage are based on morality, which varies greatly among individuals and groups. It's unfair to base laws on the morality of one group while ignoring others. It's hypocritical to have laws that enforce religious standards on the entire country, considering the controversy around the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against same-sex marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked this claim. If people would listen to institutions that conduct research and studies instead of popular opinion, they might see the world differently.",
            "Well, I'm working at a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, the fact that a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. For instance, drugs like oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances, but they're beneficial when used under medical supervision. So, while I'm not in favor of making all illegal drugs like marijuana available to the public, I do believe they should be studied and considered for medicinal purposes. After all, just because something is taboo doesn't mean it's not useful.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as people often make it out to be. While both can be harmful if abused, marijuana isn't as dangerous as substances like heroin or cocaine. That's why I think integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could work. First, we need to remove the negative stigma surrounding it. Once people see marijuana as less of a taboo, they might use it responsibly, and it can certainly have beneficial medical applications.",
            "The church, in my view, has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less rigid than in years past. Back when I was younger and attended private school, we would all don matching outfits each Sunday, complete with cute dresses, shoes, and purses. However, as I've grown older, the church has undergone significant changes. For instance, there's now a teenager mass that's been shortened to 30 minutes, and casual attire has become the norm, with families often arriving late or even in beachwear during the summer. Moreover, I've noticed that even morning masses have become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of formal attire. In my opinion, these changes are a response to the evolving times and have made the church more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I believe these issues are deeply rooted in the individual's genetic makeup and cannot be prevented by simply allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Some married men still have attractions towards children, and their behavior isn't influenced by the church's policies regarding marriage. Furthermore, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone truly wants to practice their faith and also marry, they might consider exploring other religious paths. I don't think the church could have prevented these incidents, as they are often tied to the individual's genetics and not the church's policies. However, if they were aware of the situation and chose to cover it up, they should be held accountable. Nevertheless, I don't think in all cases the church was aware of the problems.",
            "Oh, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still grappling with the aftermath of September 11. The Iraq war seemed like a pretext, with the Bush administration linking it to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since proven false, and it's still a sore point for me. The Iraq war really gets my goat.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people openly and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has disregarded the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they entered office with a plan to go to war, driven by a sense of vengeance for their dad's administration and a desire to expand our energy supply.\n\nI think it's gone on too long, and pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be ideal either. It could cause more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a major issue. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament not very effective and factions vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate politely.",

            "I don't think it's right for any state to declare it legal, or for the government to enforce any power over it. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to do otherwise would be in defiance of that principle. It seems like those advocating for its illegality are imposing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I believe the government shouldn't interfere in this matter; it's a religious issue that should be decided by the churches, not the president or any other government official. The push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader social or economic impact. In fact, I think it could even have a positive effect on society. I've said all that needs to be said on the matter.",
            "War in Iraq\nWell, let me start from the beginning. I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about why we went to war in Iraq. Before the invasion in 2003, there was an attempt to link the conflict to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, there wasn't a significant connection between the two. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks, to justify the invasion.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is a repetition of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nThe US tried to install a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they did in Vietnam. However, they underestimated the challenge. It's a long, hard process to establish democracy, and it's not something that can be achieved quickly or without significant casualties. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes, but they didn't. We're still there today, and there are still American troops dying.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one. In the 2004 presidential election, I was considering voting for George Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping for so long. We took away their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? However, we must also consider the high number of American casualties and whether it's worth continuing to risk lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe principal reason for invading Iraq was to make it a democratic nation. But why Iraq, and not other countries? The primary reason is oil. It's about controlling resources, and Iraq is a significant supplier. Before the invasion, there were claims of weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Meanwhile, we know North Korea has weapons of mass destruction, yet we're not attacking them. I don't think the government is being thorough or truthful enough in its decisions.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it may not happen.",
            "I've always been a strong advocate for gay marriage because it's a deeply personal preference that's increasingly recognized as being more biological than sociological. It's unfair to deny rights to individuals based on factors beyond their control. I find it inhumane to restrict others' choices based on their sexual orientation. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples who live their lives much like any other family. They walk their dogs, take care of their homes, and are an integral part of the community. President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his own interpretations are misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a private matter, not something that should be dictated by politics or the government. I believe that the biological predisposition towards homosexuality is something that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so with minimal fanfare, but if a same-sex couple does the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I think marriage should remain a private, personal issue rather than a public one.",

            "Some wars just drag on indefinitely. This one, in particular, has been going on far too long, originally intended to restore democracy in another country. From the outset, the purpose seemed noble, but it soon became evident that we had lost sight of that goal. Now, it appears that we are merely perpetuating the conflict to assert our global dominance. Perhaps the initial motivations were influenced by George Bush Sr.'s past disputes with Saddam Hussein, but if the original aim was to bestow democracy upon a nation lacking a fair political system, that would have been justified. However, over time, our rationale seems to have become unclear and misguided, as if we're just prolonging the war to avoid a decisive end.\n\nYou know, if our intention was to topple a tyrannical regime and bring democracy to a country, that would be a just cause. But the war has dragged on for years, and the initial goal seems to have been forgotten. We've been at war for our own sake, wanting a grand victory, and we've been pouring billions into this conflict, money that could have been used to address our own economic and social issues, like poverty or healthcare.\n\nIt's like we're pouring our resources into a war that no longer serves a valid purpose, while our own citizens suffer from lack of funding for essential services. We've been at this for too long. It's time to let the local government take over and focus our resources on our own turf. War is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are pressing issues at home that we need to address, like public infrastructure and healthcare. It's time to bring our soldiers home and let the other country deal with its own affairs.",
            "Can I clarify something? I mean, it seemed like the issue was avoided because someone went online and, well, found that there was... something there. Right?\n\nUm, I don't think that's the issue. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much open to the public. You need to understand that anyone can see what you share, especially if you're friends with someone. You're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nThat being said, I understand that it's tricky. You can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles, right? But then again, if there's a genuine concern about someone's safety or behavior, isn't it somewhat reasonable to do so?\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I have Facebook. It bothers me to know that creepy people out there can see personal information about me. I saw a show once where a guy hacked a girl's profile and found out her screen name and location in less than a minute. It's scary, and I don't want to meet people based on that kind of information. Sometimes my classmates IM me knowing it's me, even if I don't recognize their screen names. It's like they know my interests, where I am, and who my friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also use it to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but it's hard to control who can see what you share.\n\nMy roommate told me that in her high school, students were banned from having a Myspace. That seemed a bit off to me. I wasn't sure how school officials could have the power to tell students they couldn't have a Myspace. It's not a privacy issue, more of a power issue. They don't really have the right to tell people what they can and can't do online.",
            "Hmm, well, there's one more thing I need to discuss, the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it. I guess I'm going to join the crowd that says they were against it from the start. I was, but it's not as important now. The general consensus was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit they were wrong.\n\nRecent polls, both in the U.S., Iraq, and globally, show that about 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops there think it was a dumb idea and want us to leave within a year. It's been a complete disaster since we arrived.\n\nI don't know, it's just this culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle East. It's too big a gap for administrations to understand. They think they can impose democracy in an area that won't accept it. Saddam was bad, but the pros and cons should be weighed before invading. It's like quicksand; we're stuck in a mess.\n\nI don't know what to say about it. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to stay. If they want to leave gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't mind. But why not just leave now?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a quarter want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, we won't be responsible if things go wrong afterwards.",
            "While the United States has made strides in gender equality, I believe it's still an issue that's not fully resolved, particularly in specific work environments. For instance, many women face glass ceiling barriers in their professions, struggling to secure promotions due to historical gender biases. Meanwhile, men who stay at home to take care of children often face societal judgment and skepticism about their capabilities. In fields like fashion, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to preconceived notions about their interests and life choices. These instances of gender discrimination are not limited to gender but also extend to other aspects such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing, which can affect how one is perceived in a professional setting. Efforts to address these issues are ongoing, with women climbing higher ranks and men increasingly embracing stay-at-home roles, though societal acceptance is a gradual process. Ultimately, promoting understanding and acceptance through positive representations of these groups is key, without being too forceful, as societal change takes time.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. This downgraded it from a serious criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. For instance, if someone gets caught with it, they might face ramifications similar to those of a drug charge, potentially affecting job interviews and other aspects of life. While decriminalization doesn’t erase all future ramifications, it does reduce the cost of enforcement. Arresting, booking, and housing offenders, as well as court proceedings and appointing public defenders, place a significant financial burden on municipalities. Financially strained communities may thus hesitate to decriminalize, even if it could save them money. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards marijuana are more open, decriminalization is generally accepted. It frees up resources for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Still, marijuana isn’t something to be freely available everywhere. While legalizing it could make it as accessible as cigarettes, it might lead to widespread public smoking and driving under the influence. Additionally, many people still view marijuana use as taboo. Moreover, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana can have broader impacts on lifestyle. Both substances have their unique adverse effects, and individual reactions vary greatly. Some people can handle substances with moderation while others may not.",
            "I'd respond with a cautious \"yes,\" as I see the value in their traditional practices while also recognizing the need for adaptability to change. Many of their customs are deeply rooted, having been maintained for a long time. This adherence to tradition is a strength, but it's also crucial to embrace change where necessary. For instance, some Catholics are quite rigid about attending church weekly and maintaining strict adherence to their teachings. This can sometimes appear judgmental towards those who don't strictly follow the doctrine or belong to other religions. For example, my parents faced challenges when they tried to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's Episcopalian faith. This isn't reflective of the spirit of loving others, which is a core Catholic teaching, but rather a contradiction of it. I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine encourages certain actions, yet their practices often contradict these teachings, especially when they refuse to update outdated methods. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior, as child molestation is not the same as a marital relationship. I think these issues would persist regardless of marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, so I can't say whether one side is right or wrong. But I do believe it's the most complex issue we're facing today, due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure how to reconcile these things, but I think civil unions should be the default for all marriages, as they are essentially the same thing: two people united. If states can come to a logical conclusion on this, they should push for federal recognition, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. It's not important enough to amend the constitution over.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don’t agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue; each state should decide for itself. Many states are Democratic and many are Republican. Obviously, Democratic states will push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you know how the state feels about it. I don’t think you should disagree with the decision if a state legalizes it, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on each state's discretion. Well, I've already touched on that. But, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it should be up to the individual states to decide. I don’t agree with his ban on it. I don’t think Bush lives in every state, so he shouldn’t decide how each state wants to run itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Um, no, I don't agree at all. Um, let me see here. I think that Myspace is a public platform, and that means if you post something, it's meant for the public to see. Whether it be school officials or anyone else. I mean, if they see something on there that could potentially lead to a school shooting, or any other serious issue, they have every right to see it. It's not an invasion of privacy because it's publicly accessible. However, if they're just snooping around to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's for the safety and security of the students, I think that's perfectly fine. Like, if they're looking to make the school a safer place, then I don't see a problem with that. I mean, it's not like they're doing it just to catch students. They're doing it to ensure the safety of everyone. Yeah, that's about it",
            "Initially, I was fully supportive of going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much chaos as they did here. However, I now believe we overlooked long-term consequences and rushed in unprepared. The war backfired, and I'm now strongly opposed to it. The people there, consumed by their own conflicts, can't engage with us meaningfully. They're more focused on driving us out than improving their country. War is different for them; it's more savage, and I don't think they're interested in bettering their situation. We were mostly driven by anger and a desire for revenge, with President Bush leading the charge due to public sentiment. While declaring war on Iraq was necessary, we lacked a clear plan. There was no unity, and our goals were unclear. I don't think we're the ones to change them; they'll always be that way. I believe our involvement is causing more harm than good. The progress we've made is insufficient to justify our prolonged presence. It's a losing battle that we can't maintain forever. We're just hurting ourselves by staying."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to stay relevant in today's society. They argue that the Church's strong stance on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control might be turning people away. The Church's rigid views on these topics are seen as outdated by some, and they suggest that adopting a more modern perspective could help retain its following. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which could be a contributing factor to its dwindling membership. For instance, those who support abortion or gay marriage might feel uncomfortable in a community that condemns these practices. While some suggest that allowing female priests or married priests could help, it's uncertain if this would have prevented past incidents. The question remains: why can't priests, who are devoted to God, also have a family life?",
            "I’m not opposed to gay marriage, you know? I think it’s not something that people choose, consciously or otherwise. Whether you're born that way or not, it’s not a decision, and I think gay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but not two people of the same sex. I haven’t given this topic a lot of thought, but I would definitely say it’s wrong for them to say that.\n\nIt’s not like a choice, you know? People aren’t choosing to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. It doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable for something they can’t control. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this because it’s more about personal freedom than anything else. It’s not like a legal issue or a moral concern; it’s just who they are. I don’t think they should be punished for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people worry that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but the reality is that it's a different situation with many nuanced aspects that don't align with these fears. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin, where heads and tails can't be the same, but essentially it's the same thing. There are civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner in a same-sex relationship can't be considered next of kin and can't be present during a hospital visit. I think it's silly to deny this right to those who would otherwise spend the rest of their life with someone. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship factors as heterosexual couples. They are just in a different kind of relationship, but one that's still valid and meaningful. Same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a government-issued marriage certificate. If there's no involvement from the church or state in the marriage process, then the issue shouldn't cause concern. Allowing civil unions should be a step towards allowing marriage. It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as heterosexual couples in relationships and communities. People worry about adoption and how children of same-sex couples will be raised and accepted by society. However, many studies suggest that children of same-sex couples are just as well-adjusted as children from heterosexual families. There's no indication that their sexual orientation choices will negatively impact their lives. I think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. I believe the amendment should be the opposite and allow same-sex couples the right to marry. However, President Bush has strong views on this topic, influenced by his religious beliefs, which he also shares with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments for opposing gay marriage are based on morality, which varies greatly among individuals and groups. It's unfair to base laws on the morality of one group while ignoring others. It's hypocritical to have laws that enforce religious standards on the entire country, considering the controversy around the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against same-sex marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked this claim. If people would listen to institutions that conduct research and studies instead of popular opinion, they might see the world differently.",
            "Well, I'm working at a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, the fact that a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. For instance, drugs like oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances, but they're beneficial when used under medical supervision. So, while I'm not in favor of making all illegal drugs like marijuana available to the public, I do believe they should be studied and considered for medicinal purposes. After all, just because something is taboo doesn't mean it's not useful.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as people often make it out to be. While both can be harmful if abused, marijuana isn't as dangerous as substances like heroin or cocaine. That's why I think integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could work. First, we need to remove the negative stigma surrounding it. Once people see marijuana as less of a taboo, they might use it responsibly, and it can certainly have beneficial medical applications.",
            "The church, in my view, has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less rigid than in years past. Back when I was younger and attended private school, we would all don matching outfits each Sunday, complete with cute dresses, shoes, and purses. However, as I've grown older, the church has undergone significant changes. For instance, there's now a teenager mass that's been shortened to 30 minutes, and casual attire has become the norm, with families often arriving late or even in beachwear during the summer. Moreover, I've noticed that even morning masses have become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of formal attire. In my opinion, these changes are a response to the evolving times and have made the church more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I believe these issues are deeply rooted in the individual's genetic makeup and cannot be prevented by simply allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Some married men still have attractions towards children, and their behavior isn't influenced by the church's policies regarding marriage. Furthermore, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone truly wants to practice their faith and also marry, they might consider exploring other religious paths. I don't think the church could have prevented these incidents, as they are often tied to the individual's genetics and not the church's policies. However, if they were aware of the situation and chose to cover it up, they should be held accountable. Nevertheless, I don't think in all cases the church was aware of the problems.",
            "Oh, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still grappling with the aftermath of September 11. The Iraq war seemed like a pretext, with the Bush administration linking it to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since proven false, and it's still a sore point for me. The Iraq war really gets my goat.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people openly and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has disregarded the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they entered office with a plan to go to war, driven by a sense of vengeance for their dad's administration and a desire to expand our energy supply.\n\nI think it's gone on too long, and pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be ideal either. It could cause more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a major issue. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament not very effective and factions vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate politely.",

            "I don't think it's right for any state to declare it legal, or for the government to enforce any power over it. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to do otherwise would be in defiance of that principle. It seems like those advocating for its illegality are imposing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I believe the government shouldn't interfere in this matter; it's a religious issue that should be decided by the churches, not the president or any other government official. The push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader social or economic impact. In fact, I think it could even have a positive effect on society. I've said all that needs to be said on the matter.",
            "War in Iraq\nWell, let me start from the beginning. I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about why we went to war in Iraq. Before the invasion in 2003, there was an attempt to link the conflict to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, there wasn't a significant connection between the two. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks, to justify the invasion.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is a repetition of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nThe US tried to install a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they did in Vietnam. However, they underestimated the challenge. It's a long, hard process to establish democracy, and it's not something that can be achieved quickly or without significant casualties. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes, but they didn't. We're still there today, and there are still American troops dying.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one. In the 2004 presidential election, I was considering voting for George Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping for so long. We took away their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? However, we must also consider the high number of American casualties and whether it's worth continuing to risk lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe principal reason for invading Iraq was to make it a democratic nation. But why Iraq, and not other countries? The primary reason is oil. It's about controlling resources, and Iraq is a significant supplier. Before the invasion, there were claims of weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Meanwhile, we know North Korea has weapons of mass destruction, yet we're not attacking them. I don't think the government is being thorough or truthful enough in its decisions.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it may not happen.",
            "I've always been a strong advocate for gay marriage because it's a deeply personal preference that's increasingly recognized as being more biological than sociological. It's unfair to deny rights to individuals based on factors beyond their control. I find it inhumane to restrict others' choices based on their sexual orientation. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples who live their lives much like any other family. They walk their dogs, take care of their homes, and are an integral part of the community. President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his own interpretations are misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a private matter, not something that should be dictated by politics or the government. I believe that the biological predisposition towards homosexuality is something that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so with minimal fanfare, but if a same-sex couple does the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I think marriage should remain a private, personal issue rather than a public one.",

            "Some wars just drag on indefinitely. This one, in particular, has been going on far too long, originally intended to restore democracy in another country. From the outset, the purpose seemed noble, but it soon became evident that we had lost sight of that goal. Now, it appears that we are merely perpetuating the conflict to assert our global dominance. Perhaps the initial motivations were influenced by George Bush Sr.'s past disputes with Saddam Hussein, but if the original aim was to bestow democracy upon a nation lacking a fair political system, that would have been justified. However, over time, our rationale seems to have become unclear and misguided, as if we're just prolonging the war to avoid a decisive end.\n\nYou know, if our intention was to topple a tyrannical regime and bring democracy to a country, that would be a just cause. But the war has dragged on for years, and the initial goal seems to have been forgotten. We've been at war for our own sake, wanting a grand victory, and we've been pouring billions into this conflict, money that could have been used to address our own economic and social issues, like poverty or healthcare.\n\nIt's like we're pouring our resources into a war that no longer serves a valid purpose, while our own citizens suffer from lack of funding for essential services. We've been at this for too long. It's time to let the local government take over and focus our resources on our own turf. War is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are pressing issues at home that we need to address, like public infrastructure and healthcare. It's time to bring our soldiers home and let the other country deal with its own affairs.",
            "Can I clarify something? I mean, it seemed like the issue was avoided because someone went online and, well, found that there was... something there. Right?\n\nUm, I don't think that's the issue. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much open to the public. You need to understand that anyone can see what you share, especially if you're friends with someone. You're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nThat being said, I understand that it's tricky. You can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles, right? But then again, if there's a genuine concern about someone's safety or behavior, isn't it somewhat reasonable to do so?\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I have Facebook. It bothers me to know that creepy people out there can see personal information about me. I saw a show once where a guy hacked a girl's profile and found out her screen name and location in less than a minute. It's scary, and I don't want to meet people based on that kind of information. Sometimes my classmates IM me knowing it's me, even if I don't recognize their screen names. It's like they know my interests, where I am, and who my friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also use it to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but it's hard to control who can see what you share.\n\nMy roommate told me that in her high school, students were banned from having a Myspace. That seemed a bit off to me. I wasn't sure how school officials could have the power to tell students they couldn't have a Myspace. It's not a privacy issue, more of a power issue. They don't really have the right to tell people what they can and can't do online.",
            "Hmm, well, there's one more thing I need to discuss, the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it. I guess I'm going to join the crowd that says they were against it from the start. I was, but it's not as important now. The general consensus was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit they were wrong.\n\nRecent polls, both in the U.S., Iraq, and globally, show that about 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops there think it was a dumb idea and want us to leave within a year. It's been a complete disaster since we arrived.\n\nI don't know, it's just this culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle East. It's too big a gap for administrations to understand. They think they can impose democracy in an area that won't accept it. Saddam was bad, but the pros and cons should be weighed before invading. It's like quicksand; we're stuck in a mess.\n\nI don't know what to say about it. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to stay. If they want to leave gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't mind. But why not just leave now?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a quarter want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, we won't be responsible if things go wrong afterwards.",
            "While the United States has made strides in gender equality, I believe it's still an issue that's not fully resolved, particularly in specific work environments. For instance, many women face glass ceiling barriers in their professions, struggling to secure promotions due to historical gender biases. Meanwhile, men who stay at home to take care of children often face societal judgment and skepticism about their capabilities. In fields like fashion, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to preconceived notions about their interests and life choices. These instances of gender discrimination are not limited to gender but also extend to other aspects such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing, which can affect how one is perceived in a professional setting. Efforts to address these issues are ongoing, with women climbing higher ranks and men increasingly embracing stay-at-home roles, though societal acceptance is a gradual process. Ultimately, promoting understanding and acceptance through positive representations of these groups is key, without being too forceful, as societal change takes time.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. This downgraded it from a serious criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. For instance, if someone gets caught with it, they might face ramifications similar to those of a drug charge, potentially affecting job interviews and other aspects of life. While decriminalization doesn’t erase all future ramifications, it does reduce the cost of enforcement. Arresting, booking, and housing offenders, as well as court proceedings and appointing public defenders, place a significant financial burden on municipalities. Financially strained communities may thus hesitate to decriminalize, even if it could save them money. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards marijuana are more open, decriminalization is generally accepted. It frees up resources for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Still, marijuana isn’t something to be freely available everywhere. While legalizing it could make it as accessible as cigarettes, it might lead to widespread public smoking and driving under the influence. Additionally, many people still view marijuana use as taboo. Moreover, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana can have broader impacts on lifestyle. Both substances have their unique adverse effects, and individual reactions vary greatly. Some people can handle substances with moderation while others may not.",
            "I'd respond with a cautious \"yes,\" as I see the value in their traditional practices while also recognizing the need for adaptability to change. Many of their customs are deeply rooted, having been maintained for a long time. This adherence to tradition is a strength, but it's also crucial to embrace change where necessary. For instance, some Catholics are quite rigid about attending church weekly and maintaining strict adherence to their teachings. This can sometimes appear judgmental towards those who don't strictly follow the doctrine or belong to other religions. For example, my parents faced challenges when they tried to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's Episcopalian faith. This isn't reflective of the spirit of loving others, which is a core Catholic teaching, but rather a contradiction of it. I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine encourages certain actions, yet their practices often contradict these teachings, especially when they refuse to update outdated methods. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior, as child molestation is not the same as a marital relationship. I think these issues would persist regardless of marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, so I can't say whether one side is right or wrong. But I do believe it's the most complex issue we're facing today, due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure how to reconcile these things, but I think civil unions should be the default for all marriages, as they are essentially the same thing: two people united. If states can come to a logical conclusion on this, they should push for federal recognition, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. It's not important enough to amend the constitution over.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don’t agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue; each state should decide for itself. Many states are Democratic and many are Republican. Obviously, Democratic states will push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you know how the state feels about it. I don’t think you should disagree with the decision if a state legalizes it, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on each state's discretion. Well, I've already touched on that. But, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it should be up to the individual states to decide. I don’t agree with his ban on it. I don’t think Bush lives in every state, so he shouldn’t decide how each state wants to run itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Um, no, I don't agree at all. Um, let me see here. I think that Myspace is a public platform, and that means if you post something, it's meant for the public to see. Whether it be school officials or anyone else. I mean, if they see something on there that could potentially lead to a school shooting, or any other serious issue, they have every right to see it. It's not an invasion of privacy because it's publicly accessible. However, if they're just snooping around to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's for the safety and security of the students, I think that's perfectly fine. Like, if they're looking to make the school a safer place, then I don't see a problem with that. I mean, it's not like they're doing it just to catch students. They're doing it to ensure the safety of everyone. Yeah, that's about it",
            "Initially, I was fully supportive of going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much chaos as they did here. However, I now believe we overlooked long-term consequences and rushed in unprepared. The war backfired, and I'm now strongly opposed to it. The people there, consumed by their own conflicts, can't engage with us meaningfully. They're more focused on driving us out than improving their country. War is different for them; it's more savage, and I don't think they're interested in bettering their situation. We were mostly driven by anger and a desire for revenge, with President Bush leading the charge due to public sentiment. While declaring war on Iraq was necessary, we lacked a clear plan. There was no unity, and our goals were unclear. I don't think we're the ones to change them; they'll always be that way. I believe our involvement is causing more harm than good. The progress we've made is insufficient to justify our prolonged presence. It's a losing battle that we can't maintain forever. We're just hurting ourselves by staying."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt to modern thinking in several ways. They argue that the Church is losing followers because it isn't always welcoming to certain groups or ideas, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. The Church's strong stance on these issues, while understandable, can appear outdated to some. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might prevent a further decline in its following.\n\nMoreover, some people are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these subjects. For instance, those who support abortion might feel uncomfortable in a community that considers it wrong. Similarly, those who advocate for same-sex marriage could feel alienated by the Church's stance against it.\n\nWhile the Church's opposition to female priests and married priests is a contentious issue, it's unclear if allowing these changes would have prevented past scandals. Some argue that the Church's celibate priesthood is a sign of its devotion to God, but others question why priests cannot also have family lives like other professionals. Ultimately, whether priests should be allowed to marry is a complex issue with no clear-cut answer.",
            "I don't personally see a problem with gay marriage. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice, so why should people be held responsible for their sexual orientation? It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to say that. It's not really a choice, like how some people are born straight and others are gay. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this either; it's not a security or moral issue. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "Allowing gay marriage is a logical conclusion as there's no compelling argument against it. Many people erroneously believe homosexual couples threaten traditional families, but this is misleading. The dynamics of a gay relationship are as unique as those of a heterosexual union, with both sharing similar elements. Civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should extend to all committed couples, regardless of sexual orientation. Currently, a partner cannot visit a sick spouse in a hospital due to legal restrictions, which seems illogical. Scientific studies show that gay couples have the same relationship factors contributing to satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The crux of the issue is that gay couples seek a legal document, not a church ceremony. Segregating gay couples into civil unions while excluding them from marriage is akin to separate but unequal treatment. Concerns about adoption and community impact are unfounded, as parenting skills and community involvement are personality-driven, not sexual orientation. The federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide, with a constitutional amendment reversing the current ban. President Bush's stance, largely rooted in moral and religious beliefs, is divisive, considering the government's role in enforcing religious standards. Stereotypes about gay people being psychologically damaged are unfounded, as indicated by the American Psychological Association's findings. Ignoring research and over-reliance on popular opinion fosters misunderstanding.",
            "Working at a hospital pharmacy this summer, I've noticed that the legality of a drug doesn't determine its medicinal benefits. While I don't advocate for the public availability of illegal substances, I believe they should be used for their medicinal properties as long as they're beneficial. Take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, for instance—pharmacies use these controlled substances regularly despite their illegal status, because they have proven medical uses. It's a matter of embracing the benefits of these substances, including marijuana, without being swayed by societal taboos.\n\nMarijuana's reputation isn't entirely justified, as it's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. Removing the stigma around marijuana is key to its responsible use. Gradual legalization could be an effective approach to integrating marijuana into society, but first, we must dispel the idea that it's a dangerous, taboo substance.",
            "Well, I think the church has certainly adapted to the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Back when I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses, and even matching shoes and purses. It was a bit more formal then, especially at my private school where we'd all meet there on weekends. But these days, they've introduced a teenager-specific mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually, especially during summer when you see folks in beach clothes coming straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now. It's certainly become more casual, which is a change from the formal attire of the past.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think those issues could have been entirely prevented. Even if priests were allowed to marry, it wouldn't necessarily change much. Some men who become pedophiles are married and still have attractions towards young kids. I think it's more about genetics than about being brought up in a particular way. I don't believe marriage could hide those tendencies. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, that would be shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. In terms of the church itself, I don't have any other thoughts to add.",
            "(Chuckles)\nInitially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the entire country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We seemed to have gone into Iraq under false pretenses, using the September 11th attacks as a pretext. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be completely false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and has yet to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, after presenting evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced. To me, that's malfeasance, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. It seems like they came into office with a mission to go to war. One of the Bush administration's former officials even wrote in his book that the younger Bush entered with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein. Additionally, there's a suspicion that they aimed to expand our energy supply. I think it's gone on too long, but I'm worried about what would happen if we withdrew now. The country could potentially lapse into civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, involving a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be a good idea either, as it could lead to more long-term problems over Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is dissolving, and the Parliament doesn't seem effective. The Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a messy situation.\n\n(Chuckles)\nNone that I can express in polite company",
            "Talk into it? Okay, let's chat. So, how do you feel about the War in Iraq? Let me think. Well, at this point, I think it's become somewhat pointless. It's not even a declared war, and I feel like it was just our way of getting back at Iraq, who we thought was behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into following the details of the war, but I understand we're trying to build democracy there to make it more like the U.S. and maybe secure oil resources. However, I don't think this is a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, it will upset everyone, and they'll have to rebuild their country from scratch. I'm just not an expert on this topic, so let me see if I can express my thoughts better. I believe the war should continue, but I don't think we should refer to it as a war anymore since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. We only use guns and such to show our strength, but I don't think there's a strong reason to keep calling it a war. I think it's better to stay and help build a better Iraq, but it's also a waste of resources. Plus, it makes Bush look like one of the worst presidents due to the current situation. It's like the Vietnam War all over again – undeclared and now called a meaningless war. If we continue the Iraq War, it could go on for years. It's hard to say if I want it to end because I know many families have loved ones in Iraq. They have lives too, and we've disrupted their society. But if we stay, we'll try to mold Iraq into something more like the U.S., which could cause more hatred and make the Al-Qaeda problem worse. I think it's going to be a long, drawn-out conflict. So, that's my take.",
            "It's just not right to make it legal or for a state to declare it as such. I firmly believe it's up to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It would be a clear defiance of the constitution to try and enforce any power over it. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for some areas like Boston. It's not the government's place to decide what churches can or can't make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Adding an amendment would be wrong and contradictory to the constitution, and it could be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. Therefore, I don't see why the federal government should be involved. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal Catholic beliefs, which is a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. It might even boost the economy and society in some ways.",
            "The war in Iraq is a complex and controversial issue. Let's start from the beginning. I don't believe the government was completely truthful with the American people regarding the reasons for the war.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq and link it to the September 11th terrorist attacks was, in my opinion, a leap in logic. The government played on the public's emotions to gain support for the invasion. The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the beginning, especially the preemptive strike.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq reminded me of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it seems they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not well-prepared for the chaos that followed.\n\nThe government removed the Iraqi government and attempted to install a democratic one, similar to the attempt in Vietnam. However, it was clear that this would be a lengthy and challenging process. The government should have been more transparent about the challenges ahead.\n\nLooking back, I think the government was not well-prepared for the aftermath and tried to conceal the difficulties from the public. This war has been ongoing for several years, and despite the training of Iraqi troops, the situation is still unstable.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one, and I struggled with it during the 2004 presidential election. I considered voting for George Bush because I believed he should finish what he started. However, the high number of American casualties and the question of whether the invasion was purely about oil also weighed heavily on me.\n\nIt is hard to know how much longer this war will continue. I hope it ends soon, but it may be naive to expect an immediate resolution.",
            "Well, let me just say, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. It's a personal choice, and I believe it's rooted more in biology than sociology. I think it's unfair to deny people rights over something they can't control. I mean, it's inhumane, and I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics or government should have a say in this—it's a personal, household matter. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples, and they live their lives just like any other family. I think it's absurd that Bush tries to interpret the meaning of marriage in his own way. It's just not right.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that being gay may be a chemical predisposition, not something influenced by upbringing. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something in the public eye or debated at the national level. No, I don't think it should be a public or federal issue.",

            "The war seems to have dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, it appears we've lost sight of that original purpose and are now possibly involved for the sake of demonstrating our global prowess. George Bush's father had previous disagreements with Saddam Hussein, and it's unclear if these personal grievances played a role. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, it would be justifiable. However, it seems our motivations have shifted and degenerated over time. We're now at war just for the sake of being at war, not wanting to appear weak by ending it without a decisive outcome. This conflict has been ongoing for too long, and it's time to stop. Other countries must take responsibility for their own governance, especially since we're spending billions on a war that we've long lost sight of. It's a significant strain on our economy, money that could be better spent addressing our own issues, such as poverty and healthcare.",
            "I have a question to clarify something.\n\nWell, it was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a situation like...\n\nSure, okay.\n\nNo, I don't think that’s an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. I understand that on Myspace, you need to have a friend or something to see someone’s profile. If that's the case, you’ve accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission, right? So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHmm, well, that's tough. I mean, obviously, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.\" I mean, I don’t think it would really be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But then again, it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence that the student was planning something, or were they just randomly looking and happened to see that?\n\nOh, I see. Well, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this man who went onto a girl’s profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like less than a minute and got her to meet with him. I mean, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it’s me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your appearance, sometimes even your class schedule. They pretty much know a lot about you – all sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but, at the same time, the whole point is I think the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don’t want to limit it too much. So, it’s a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.\n\nI heard that my roommate was telling me that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school. I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace. I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that. That’s the only other thought I can think of.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just women; it affects men too, depending on the industry or the role they take on\nUm\nFor instance, while women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they struggle to break into positions of power in the business world, men can also face challenges\nUm\nTake, for example, a man in the fashion industry or a stay-at-home dad\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, men often face skepticism because they are perceived to lack understanding of the female perspective\nAnd a stay-at-home dad might face societal judgment for not being the primary breadwinner\nUm\nI believe that gender discrimination is prevalent across various fields and societal perceptions can vary greatly\nUm\nBut I think we're making progress, although it's slow, as more women are reaching higher positions and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted\nUm\nTo change society's mindset, it's essential to promote the positive qualities of those who face discrimination without being too forceful\nUm\nIt's a complex issue that requires time and patience to address fully",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, but they decriminalized it. Essentially, it's been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. If caught and cited, the repercussions for job interviews and other things won't be as severe as they would be for a drug charge. However, the future ramifications of getting caught are still a concern for many, especially kids and other worried individuals. Despite this, there's an argument that arrests and trials cost a lot of money, and many municipalities, especially those in financial distress, may not want to make that sort of concession. In a more liberal place like Denver, though, decriminalization has been successful, freeing up funds for programs like public education, social services for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not that we want marijuana to be everywhere, but rather that we should consider the financial implications as well. I don't know how I feel about it being widely available though, like cigarettes. It might lead to more people smoking and driving, which is taboo in many places. Additionally, I think alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more long-term effects on lifestyle. Ultimately, no two people react the same way to substances, and I think both have their adverse effects.",
            "Yes, I would say yes.\nYou know, a lot of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition, something they've done for a long time. It's good to be grounded in history, but it is also crucial to adapt to change.\nFor many Catholics, attending Church every week is a must, and their adherence to rituals is quite strict. Sometimes, I feel they look down on those who don't follow the rules strictly or are not perfect Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents' religions were different—my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian—and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's denomination. That's not very inclusive, especially considering the Church's teachings to love others.\nIt feels like the Church's doctrine and its practice don't always match up, as some teachings are quite outdated. They seem to hold onto traditions even when they're no longer relevant.\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily stop pedophilia, as the motivation behind such actions isn't necessarily linked to marital status. They might engage in such behavior regardless of their marital status. So, I don't think it would make a significant difference.",
            "I must admit, I'm still undecided on this matter. It's a prickly issue, straddling the line between church and state, and how to define marriage. Something so close to the heart of our society can be terribly tricky to navigate without causing offense. I believe that if we consider all civil unions as such, then it might make the most sense to treat them as such. After all, it's simply a union of two people, and the government should not delve into the specifics of one's religious or personal beliefs. If all states can come to a logical consensus, then they should push for federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. It's not important enough to warrant amending the constitution. Simply put, no.",
            "I was, after all, raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous to me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself. Many states are democratic, and others are republican, which means there's likely to be a vast difference of opinion on the subject. If you live in a democratic state, you understand the leaning towards legalizing gay marriage, and since you've chosen to live there, you should respect that decision. I believe homosexuals should enjoy the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and I believe legalization should be a state-by-state issue. Bush, I feel, shouldn't dictate how the entire country feels about this, as he won't be in office for much longer. If a democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just be another back-and-forth, and the best approach is to let each state decide based on their own values and beliefs.",
            "Some stories just grab your attention...like this one. Um, I don't at all. Um, let’s see, I'm not really sure how to put this. The way I figure it, Myspace is a public thing. It's basically a bulletin board where you post things for everyone to see. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it, whether they're school officials or not. So, I think it's only reasonable that school officials see what's posted on Myspace. Even if it's not under the school's name, they could access it through their homes. But, if it's to prevent something like a school shooting, which is a responsibility of the school system, then I think that's perfectly fine. I feel like it's a public thing, and the school officials aren't invading privacy if they're trying to make the school a safer place. I mean, they go on there just to catch students and get them in trouble, and that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, um, alright, well, um, hmm. It’s a lot easier to express yourself when you’re writing, but, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing. And, with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that’s ridiculous. Um, everything, like I’m worried to post stuff, even through emails, because I’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up. Um, like, everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. Like, you know, if you do something while you’re a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, and they find an email that you sent somehow. And, once it’s on the internet, it’s always on the internet, and there's no way of getting out of it. You will get in trouble, and it wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, it’s a public thing. Um, I don’t know, let’s see here. Like I had said before, I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. Um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they’re dropping them off at a safe place. I’ve actually discussed that with a teacher of mine. I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff. And, um, that’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks. Uh, we had to be safe about that. We had drill stuff, and even though that doesn’t have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was, you know, in case people would come into the building, I guess. Um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place. And, um, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case. They were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh, no, that’s about it.",
            "I initially supported the war, especially given my personal connection to 9/11. I wanted justice and to cause as much chaos as they did to us. However, I believe we acted irrationally, driven by emotion and anger, without a clear plan. I now question if it was the right decision. The people there, as long as they're fighting each other, won't be fighting with us. I don't think our presence there is making a difference. They're more interested in getting us to leave than improving their own country. We were just looking for revenge, and the president acted on the people's emotions. We couldn't let Iraq get away with attacking us, but I think we could have had a better plan. There was no clear goal or unity. I don't think we're making enough progress to stay there, and I believe that once we leave, the situation will collapse. We're harming ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community

every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt to modern thinking in several ways. They argue that the Church is losing followers because it isn't always welcoming to certain groups or ideas, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. The Church's strong stance on these issues, while understandable, can appear outdated to some. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might prevent a further decline in its following.\n\nMoreover, some people are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these subjects. For instance, those who support abortion might feel uncomfortable in a community that considers it wrong. Similarly, those who advocate for same-sex marriage could feel alienated by the Church's stance against it.\n\nWhile the Church's opposition to female priests and married priests is a contentious issue, it's unclear if allowing these changes would have prevented past scandals. Some argue that the Church's celibate priesthood is a sign of its devotion to God, but others question why priests cannot also have family lives like other professionals. Ultimately, whether priests should be allowed to marry is a complex issue with no clear-cut answer.",
            "I don't personally see a problem with gay marriage. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice, so why should people be held responsible for their sexual orientation? It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to say that. It's not really a choice, like how some people are born straight and others are gay. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this either; it's not a security or moral issue. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "Allowing gay marriage is a logical conclusion as there's no compelling argument against it. Many people erroneously believe homosexual couples threaten traditional families, but this is misleading. The dynamics of a gay relationship are as unique as those of a heterosexual union, with both sharing similar elements. Civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should extend to all committed couples, regardless of sexual orientation. Currently, a partner cannot visit a sick spouse in a hospital due to legal restrictions, which seems illogical. Scientific studies show that gay couples have the same relationship factors contributing to satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The crux of the issue is that gay couples seek a legal document, not a church ceremony. Segregating gay couples into civil unions while excluding them from marriage is akin to separate but unequal treatment. Concerns about adoption and community impact are unfounded, as parenting skills and community involvement are personality-driven, not sexual orientation. The federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide, with a constitutional amendment reversing the current ban. President Bush's stance, largely rooted in moral and religious beliefs, is divisive, considering the government's role in enforcing religious standards. Stereotypes about gay people being psychologically damaged are unfounded, as indicated by the American Psychological Association's findings. Ignoring research and over-reliance on popular opinion fosters misunderstanding.",
            "Working at a hospital pharmacy this summer, I've noticed that the legality of a drug doesn't determine its medicinal benefits. While I don't advocate for the public availability of illegal substances, I believe they should be used for their medicinal properties as long as they're beneficial. Take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, for instance—pharmacies use these controlled substances regularly despite their illegal status, because they have proven medical uses. It's a matter of embracing the benefits of these substances, including marijuana, without being swayed by societal taboos.\n\nMarijuana's reputation isn't entirely justified, as it's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. Removing the stigma around marijuana is key to its responsible use. Gradual legalization could be an effective approach to integrating marijuana into society, but first, we must dispel the idea that it's a dangerous, taboo substance.",
            "Well, I think the church has certainly adapted to the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Back when I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses, and even matching shoes and purses. It was a bit more formal then, especially at my private school where we'd all meet there on weekends. But these days, they've introduced a teenager-specific mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually, especially during summer when you see folks in beach clothes coming straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now. It's certainly become more casual, which is a change from the formal attire of the past.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think those issues could have been entirely prevented. Even if priests were allowed to marry, it wouldn't necessarily change much. Some men who become pedophiles are married and still have attractions towards young kids. I think it's more about genetics than about being brought up in a particular way. I don't believe marriage could hide those tendencies. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, that would be shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. In terms of the church itself, I don't have any other thoughts to add.",
            "(Chuckles)\nInitially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the entire country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We seemed to have gone into Iraq under false pretenses, using the September 11th attacks as a pretext. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be completely false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and has yet to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, after presenting evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced. To me, that's malfeasance, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. It seems like they came into office with a mission to go to war. One of the Bush administration's former officials even wrote in his book that the younger Bush entered with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein. Additionally, there's a suspicion that they aimed to expand our energy supply. I think it's gone on too long, but I'm worried about what would happen if we withdrew now. The country could potentially lapse into civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, involving a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be a good idea either, as it could lead to more long-term problems over Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is dissolving, and the Parliament doesn't seem effective. The Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a messy situation.\n\n(Chuckles)\nNone that I can express in polite company",
            "Talk into it? Okay, let's chat. So, how do you feel about the War in Iraq? Let me think. Well, at this point, I think it's become somewhat pointless. It's not even a declared war, and I feel like it was just our way of getting back at Iraq, who we thought was behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into following the details of the war, but I understand we're trying to build democracy there to make it more like the U.S. and maybe secure oil resources. However, I don't think this is a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, it will upset everyone, and they'll have to rebuild their country from scratch. I'm just not an expert on this topic, so let me see if I can express my thoughts better. I believe the war should continue, but I don't think we should refer to it as a war anymore since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. We only use guns and such to show our strength, but I don't think there's a strong reason to keep calling it a war. I think it's better to stay and help build a better Iraq, but it's also a waste of resources. Plus, it makes Bush look like one of the worst presidents due to the current situation. It's like the Vietnam War all over again – undeclared and now called a meaningless war. If we continue the Iraq War, it could go on for years. It's hard to say if I want it to end because I know many families have loved ones in Iraq. They have lives too, and we've disrupted their society. But if we stay, we'll try to mold Iraq into something more like the U.S., which could cause more hatred and make the Al-Qaeda problem worse. I think it's going to be a long, drawn-out conflict. So, that's my take.",
            "It's just not right to make it legal or for a state to declare it as such. I firmly believe it's up to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It would be a clear defiance of the constitution to try and enforce any power over it. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for some areas like Boston. It's not the government's place to decide what churches can or can't make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Adding an amendment would be wrong and contradictory to the constitution, and it could be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. Therefore, I don't see why the federal government should be involved. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal Catholic beliefs, which is a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. It might even boost the economy and society in some ways.",
            "The war in Iraq is a complex and controversial issue. Let's start from the beginning. I don't believe the government was completely truthful with the American people regarding the reasons for the war.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq and link it to the September 11th terrorist attacks was, in my opinion, a leap in logic. The government played on the public's emotions to gain support for the invasion. The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the beginning, especially the preemptive strike.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq reminded me of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it seems they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not well-prepared for the chaos that followed.\n\nThe government removed the Iraqi government and attempted to install a democratic one, similar to the attempt in Vietnam. However, it was clear that this would be a lengthy and challenging process. The government should have been more transparent about the challenges ahead.\n\nLooking back, I think the government was not well-prepared for the aftermath and tried to conceal the difficulties from the public. This war has been ongoing for several years, and despite the training of Iraqi troops, the situation is still unstable.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one, and I struggled with it during the 2004 presidential election. I considered voting for George Bush because I believed he should finish what he started. However, the high number of American casualties and the question of whether the invasion was purely about oil also weighed heavily on me.\n\nIt is hard to know how much longer this war will continue. I hope it ends soon, but it may be naive to expect an immediate resolution.",
            "Well, let me just say, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. It's a personal choice, and I believe it's rooted more in biology than sociology. I think it's unfair to deny people rights over something they can't control. I mean, it's inhumane, and I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics or government should have a say in this—it's a personal, household matter. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples, and they live their lives just like any other family. I think it's absurd that Bush tries to interpret the meaning of marriage in his own way. It's just not right.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that being gay may be a chemical predisposition, not something influenced by upbringing. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something in the public eye or debated at the national level. No, I don't think it should be a public or federal issue.",

            "The war seems to have dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, it appears we've lost sight of that original purpose and are now possibly involved for the sake of demonstrating our global prowess. George Bush's father had previous disagreements with Saddam Hussein, and it's unclear if these personal grievances played a role. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, it would be justifiable. However, it seems our motivations have shifted and degenerated over time. We're now at war just for the sake of being at war, not wanting to appear weak by ending it without a decisive outcome. This conflict has been ongoing for too long, and it's time to stop. Other countries must take responsibility for their own governance, especially since we're spending billions on a war that we've long lost sight of. It's a significant strain on our economy, money that could be better spent addressing our own issues, such as poverty and healthcare.",
            "I have a question to clarify something.\n\nWell, it was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a situation like...\n\nSure, okay.\n\nNo, I don't think that’s an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. I understand that on Myspace, you need to have a friend or something to see someone’s profile. If that's the case, you’ve accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission, right? So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHmm, well, that's tough. I mean, obviously, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.\" I mean, I don’t think it would really be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But then again, it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence that the student was planning something, or were they just randomly looking and happened to see that?\n\nOh, I see. Well, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this man who went onto a girl’s profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like less than a minute and got her to meet with him. I mean, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it’s me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your appearance, sometimes even your class schedule. They pretty much know a lot about you – all sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but, at the same time, the whole point is I think the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don’t want to limit it too much. So, it’s a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.\n\nI heard that my roommate was telling me that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school. I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace. I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that. That’s the only other thought I can think of.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just women; it affects men too, depending on the industry or the role they take on\nUm\nFor instance, while women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they struggle to break into positions of power in the business world, men can also face challenges\nUm\nTake, for example, a man in the fashion industry or a stay-at-home dad\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, men often face skepticism because they are perceived to lack understanding of the female perspective\nAnd a stay-at-home dad might face societal judgment for not being the primary breadwinner\nUm\nI believe that gender discrimination is prevalent across various fields and societal perceptions can vary greatly\nUm\nBut I think we're making progress, although it's slow, as more women are reaching higher positions and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted\nUm\nTo change society's mindset, it's essential to promote the positive qualities of those who face discrimination without being too forceful\nUm\nIt's a complex issue that requires time and patience to address fully",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, but they decriminalized it. Essentially, it's been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. If caught and cited, the repercussions for job interviews and other things won't be as severe as they would be for a drug charge. However, the future ramifications of getting caught are still a concern for many, especially kids and other worried individuals. Despite this, there's an argument that arrests and trials cost a lot of money, and many municipalities, especially those in financial distress, may not want to make that sort of concession. In a more liberal place like Denver, though, decriminalization has been successful, freeing up funds for programs like public education, social services for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not that we want marijuana to be everywhere, but rather that we should consider the financial implications as well. I don't know how I feel about it being widely available though, like cigarettes. It might lead to more people smoking and driving, which is taboo in many places. Additionally, I think alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more long-term effects on lifestyle. Ultimately, no two people react the same way to substances, and I think both have their adverse effects.",
            "Yes, I would say yes.\nYou know, a lot of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition, something they've done for a long time. It's good to be grounded in history, but it is also crucial to adapt to change.\nFor many Catholics, attending Church every week is a must, and their adherence to rituals is quite strict. Sometimes, I feel they look down on those who don't follow the rules strictly or are not perfect Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents' religions were different—my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian—and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's denomination. That's not very inclusive, especially considering the Church's teachings to love others.\nIt feels like the Church's doctrine and its practice don't always match up, as some teachings are quite outdated. They seem to hold onto traditions even when they're no longer relevant.\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily stop pedophilia, as the motivation behind such actions isn't necessarily linked to marital status. They might engage in such behavior regardless of their marital status. So, I don't think it would make a significant difference.",
            "I must admit, I'm still undecided on this matter. It's a prickly issue, straddling the line between church and state, and how to define marriage. Something so close to the heart of our society can be terribly tricky to navigate without causing offense. I believe that if we consider all civil unions as such, then it might make the most sense to treat them as such. After all, it's simply a union of two people, and the government should not delve into the specifics of one's religious or personal beliefs. If all states can come to a logical consensus, then they should push for federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. It's not important enough to warrant amending the constitution. Simply put, no.",
            "I was, after all, raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous to me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself. Many states are democratic, and others are republican, which means there's likely to be a vast difference of opinion on the subject. If you live in a democratic state, you understand the leaning towards legalizing gay marriage, and since you've chosen to live there, you should respect that decision. I believe homosexuals should enjoy the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and I believe legalization should be a state-by-state issue. Bush, I feel, shouldn't dictate how the entire country feels about this, as he won't be in office for much longer. If a democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just be another back-and-forth, and the best approach is to let each state decide based on their own values and beliefs.",
            "Some stories just grab your attention...like this one. Um, I don't at all. Um, let’s see, I'm not really sure how to put this. The way I figure it, Myspace is a public thing. It's basically a bulletin board where you post things for everyone to see. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it, whether they're school officials or not. So, I think it's only reasonable that school officials see what's posted on Myspace. Even if it's not under the school's name, they could access it through their homes. But, if it's to prevent something like a school shooting, which is a responsibility of the school system, then I think that's perfectly fine. I feel like it's a public thing, and the school officials aren't invading privacy if they're trying to make the school a safer place. I mean, they go on there just to catch students and get them in trouble, and that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, um, alright, well, um, hmm. It’s a lot easier to express yourself when you’re writing, but, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing. And, with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that’s ridiculous. Um, everything, like I’m worried to post stuff, even through emails, because I’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up. Um, like, everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. Like, you know, if you do something while you’re a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, and they find an email that you sent somehow. And, once it’s on the internet, it’s always on the internet, and there's no way of getting out of it. You will get in trouble, and it wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, it’s a public thing. Um, I don’t know, let’s see here. Like I had said before, I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. Um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they’re dropping them off at a safe place. I’ve actually discussed that with a teacher of mine. I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff. And, um, that’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks. Uh, we had to be safe about that. We had drill stuff, and even though that doesn’t have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was, you know, in case people would come into the building, I guess. Um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place. And, um, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case. They were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh, no, that’s about it.",
            "I initially supported the war, especially given my personal connection to 9/11. I wanted justice and to cause as much chaos as they did to us. However, I believe we acted irrationally, driven by emotion and anger, without a clear plan. I now question if it was the right decision. The people there, as long as they're fighting each other, won't be fighting with us. I don't think our presence there is making a difference. They're more interested in getting us to leave than improving their own country. We were just looking for revenge, and the president acted on the people's emotions. We couldn't let Iraq get away with attacking us, but I think we could have had a better plan. There was no clear goal or unity. I don't think we're making enough progress to stay there, and I believe that once we leave, the situation will collapse. We're harming ourselves by staying."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt to modern thinking in several ways. They argue that the Church is losing followers because it isn't always welcoming to certain groups or ideas, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. The Church's strong stance on these issues, while understandable, can appear outdated to some. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might prevent a further decline in its following.\n\nMoreover, some people are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these subjects. For instance, those who support abortion might feel uncomfortable in a community that considers it wrong. Similarly, those who advocate for same-sex marriage could feel alienated by the Church's stance against it.\n\nWhile the Church's opposition to female priests and married priests is a contentious issue, it's unclear if allowing these changes would have prevented past scandals. Some argue that the Church's celibate priesthood is a sign of its devotion to God, but others question why priests cannot also have family lives like other professionals. Ultimately, whether priests should be allowed to marry is a complex issue with no clear-cut answer.",
            "I don't personally see a problem with gay marriage. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice, so why should people be held responsible for their sexual orientation? It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to say that. It's not really a choice, like how some people are born straight and others are gay. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this either; it's not a security or moral issue. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "Allowing gay marriage is a logical conclusion as there's no compelling argument against it. Many people erroneously believe homosexual couples threaten traditional families, but this is misleading. The dynamics of a gay relationship are as unique as those of a heterosexual union, with both sharing similar elements. Civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should extend to all committed couples, regardless of sexual orientation. Currently, a partner cannot visit a sick spouse in a hospital due to legal restrictions, which seems illogical. Scientific studies show that gay couples have the same relationship factors contributing to satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The crux of the issue is that gay couples seek a legal document, not a church ceremony. Segregating gay couples into civil unions while excluding them from marriage is akin to separate but unequal treatment. Concerns about adoption and community impact are unfounded, as parenting skills and community involvement are personality-driven, not sexual orientation. The federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide, with a constitutional amendment reversing the current ban. President Bush's stance, largely rooted in moral and religious beliefs, is divisive, considering the government's role in enforcing religious standards. Stereotypes about gay people being psychologically damaged are unfounded, as indicated by the American Psychological Association's findings. Ignoring research and over-reliance on popular opinion fosters misunderstanding.",
            "Working at a hospital pharmacy this summer, I've noticed that the legality of a drug doesn't determine its medicinal benefits. While I don't advocate for the public availability of illegal substances, I believe they should be used for their medicinal properties as long as they're beneficial. Take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, for instance—pharmacies use these controlled substances regularly despite their illegal status, because they have proven medical uses. It's a matter of embracing the benefits of these substances, including marijuana, without being swayed by societal taboos.\n\nMarijuana's reputation isn't entirely justified, as it's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. Removing the stigma around marijuana is key to its responsible use. Gradual legalization could be an effective approach to integrating marijuana into society, but first, we must dispel the idea that it's a dangerous, taboo substance.",
            "Well, I think the church has certainly adapted to the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Back when I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses, and even matching shoes and purses. It was a bit more formal then, especially at my private school where we'd all meet there on weekends. But these days, they've introduced a teenager-specific mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually, especially during summer when you see folks in beach clothes coming straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now. It's certainly become more casual, which is a change from the formal attire of the past.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think those issues could have been entirely prevented. Even if priests were allowed to marry, it wouldn't necessarily change much. Some men who become pedophiles are married and still have attractions towards young kids. I think it's more about genetics than about being brought up in a particular way. I don't believe marriage could hide those tendencies. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, that would be shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. In terms of the church itself, I don't have any other thoughts to add.",
            "(Chuckles)\nInitially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the entire country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We seemed to have gone into Iraq under false pretenses, using the September 11th attacks as a pretext. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be completely false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and has yet to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, after presenting evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced. To me, that's malfeasance, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. It seems like they came into office with a mission to go to war. One of the Bush administration's former officials even wrote in his book that the younger Bush entered with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein. Additionally, there's a suspicion that they aimed to expand our energy supply. I think it's gone on too long, but I'm worried about what would happen if we withdrew now. The country could potentially lapse into civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, involving a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be a good idea either, as it could lead to more long-term problems over Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is dissolving, and the Parliament doesn't seem effective. The Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a messy situation.\n\n(Chuckles)\nNone that I can express in polite company",
            "Talk into it? Okay, let's chat. So, how do you feel about the War in Iraq? Let me think. Well, at this point, I think it's become somewhat pointless. It's not even a declared war, and I feel like it was just our way of getting back at Iraq, who we thought was behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into following the details of the war, but I understand we're trying to build democracy there to make it more like the U.S. and maybe secure oil resources. However, I don't think this is a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, it will upset everyone, and they'll have to rebuild their country from scratch. I'm just not an expert on this topic, so let me see if I can express my thoughts better. I believe the war should continue, but I don't think we should refer to it as a war anymore since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. We only use guns and such to show our strength, but I don't think there's a strong reason to keep calling it a war. I think it's better to stay and help build a better Iraq, but it's also a waste of resources. Plus, it makes Bush look like one of the worst presidents due to the current situation. It's like the Vietnam War all over again – undeclared and now called a meaningless war. If we continue the Iraq War, it could go on for years. It's hard to say if I want it to end because I know many families have loved ones in Iraq. They have lives too, and we've disrupted their society. But if we stay, we'll try to mold Iraq into something more like the U.S., which could cause more hatred and make the Al-Qaeda problem worse. I think it's going to be a long, drawn-out conflict. So, that's my take.",
            "It's just not right to make it legal or for a state to declare it as such. I firmly believe it's up to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It would be a clear defiance of the constitution to try and enforce any power over it. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for some areas like Boston. It's not the government's place to decide what churches can or can't make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Adding an amendment would be wrong and contradictory to the constitution, and it could be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. Therefore, I don't see why the federal government should be involved. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal Catholic beliefs, which is a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. It might even boost the economy and society in some ways.",
            "The war in Iraq is a complex and controversial issue. Let's start from the beginning. I don't believe the government was completely truthful with the American people regarding the reasons for the war.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq and link it to the September 11th terrorist attacks was, in my opinion, a leap in logic. The government played on the public's emotions to gain support for the invasion. The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the beginning, especially the preemptive strike.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq reminded me of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it seems they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not well-prepared for the chaos that followed.\n\nThe government removed the Iraqi government and attempted to install a democratic one, similar to the attempt in Vietnam. However, it was clear that this would be a lengthy and challenging process. The government should have been more transparent about the challenges ahead.\n\nLooking back, I think the government was not well-prepared for the aftermath and tried to conceal the difficulties from the public. This war has been ongoing for several years, and despite the training of Iraqi troops, the situation is still unstable.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one, and I struggled with it during the 2004 presidential election. I considered voting for George Bush because I believed he should finish what he started. However, the high number of American casualties and the question of whether the invasion was purely about oil also weighed heavily on me.\n\nIt is hard to know how much longer this war will continue. I hope it ends soon, but it may be naive to expect an immediate resolution.",
            "Well, let me just say, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. It's a personal choice, and I believe it's rooted more in biology than sociology. I think it's unfair to deny people rights over something they can't control. I mean, it's inhumane, and I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics or government should have a say in this—it's a personal, household matter. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples, and they live their lives just like any other family. I think it's absurd that Bush tries to interpret the meaning of marriage in his own way. It's just not right.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that being gay may be a chemical predisposition, not something influenced by upbringing. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something in the public eye or debated at the national level. No, I don't think it should be a public or federal issue.",

            "The war seems to have dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, it appears we've lost sight of that original purpose and are now possibly involved for the sake of demonstrating our global prowess. George Bush's father had previous disagreements with Saddam Hussein, and it's unclear if these personal grievances played a role. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, it would be justifiable. However, it seems our motivations have shifted and degenerated over time. We're now at war just for the sake of being at war, not wanting to appear weak by ending it without a decisive outcome. This conflict has been ongoing for too long, and it's time to stop. Other countries must take responsibility for their own governance, especially since we're spending billions on a war that we've long lost sight of. It's a significant strain on our economy, money that could be better spent addressing our own issues, such as poverty and healthcare.",
            "I have a question to clarify something.\n\nWell, it was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a situation like...\n\nSure, okay.\n\nNo, I don't think that’s an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. I understand that on Myspace, you need to have a friend or something to see someone’s profile. If that's the case, you’ve accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission, right? So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHmm, well, that's tough. I mean, obviously, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.\" I mean, I don’t think it would really be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But then again, it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence that the student was planning something, or were they just randomly looking and happened to see that?\n\nOh, I see. Well, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this man who went onto a girl’s profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like less than a minute and got her to meet with him. I mean, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it’s me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your appearance, sometimes even your class schedule. They pretty much know a lot about you – all sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but, at the same time, the whole point is I think the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don’t want to limit it too much. So, it’s a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.\n\nI heard that my roommate was telling me that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school. I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace. I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that. That’s the only other thought I can think of.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just women; it affects men too, depending on the industry or the role they take on\nUm\nFor instance, while women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they struggle to break into positions of power in the business world, men can also face challenges\nUm\nTake, for example, a man in the fashion industry or a stay-at-home dad\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, men often face skepticism because they are perceived to lack understanding of the female perspective\nAnd a stay-at-home dad might face societal judgment for not being the primary breadwinner\nUm\nI believe that gender discrimination is prevalent across various fields and societal perceptions can vary greatly\nUm\nBut I think we're making progress, although it's slow, as more women are reaching higher positions and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted\nUm\nTo change society's mindset, it's essential to promote the positive qualities of those who face discrimination without being too forceful\nUm\nIt's a complex issue that requires time and patience to address fully",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, but they decriminalized it. Essentially, it's been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. If caught and cited, the repercussions for job interviews and other things won't be as severe as they would be for a drug charge. However, the future ramifications of getting caught are still a concern for many, especially kids and other worried individuals. Despite this, there's an argument that arrests and trials cost a lot of money, and many municipalities, especially those in financial distress, may not want to make that sort of concession. In a more liberal place like Denver, though, decriminalization has been successful, freeing up funds for programs like public education, social services for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not that we want marijuana to be everywhere, but rather that we should consider the financial implications as well. I don't know how I feel about it being widely available though, like cigarettes. It might lead to more people smoking and driving, which is taboo in many places. Additionally, I think alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more long-term effects on lifestyle. Ultimately, no two people react the same way to substances, and I think both have their adverse effects.",
            "Yes, I would say yes.\nYou know, a lot of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition, something they've done for a long time. It's good to be grounded in history, but it is also crucial to adapt to change.\nFor many Catholics, attending Church every week is a must, and their adherence to rituals is quite strict. Sometimes, I feel they look down on those who don't follow the rules strictly or are not perfect Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents' religions were different—my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian—and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's denomination. That's not very inclusive, especially considering the Church's teachings to love others.\nIt feels like the Church's doctrine and its practice don't always match up, as some teachings are quite outdated. They seem to hold onto traditions even when they're no longer relevant.\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily stop pedophilia, as the motivation behind such actions isn't necessarily linked to marital status. They might engage in such behavior regardless of their marital status. So, I don't think it would make a significant difference.",
            "I must admit, I'm still undecided on this matter. It's a prickly issue, straddling the line between church and state, and how to define marriage. Something so close to the heart of our society can be terribly tricky to navigate without causing offense. I believe that if we consider all civil unions as such, then it might make the most sense to treat them as such. After all, it's simply a union of two people, and the government should not delve into the specifics of one's religious or personal beliefs. If all states can come to a logical consensus, then they should push for federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. It's not important enough to warrant amending the constitution. Simply put, no.",
            "I was, after all, raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous to me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself. Many states are democratic, and others are republican, which means there's likely to be a vast difference of opinion on the subject. If you live in a democratic state, you understand the leaning towards legalizing gay marriage, and since you've chosen to live there, you should respect that decision. I believe homosexuals should enjoy the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and I believe legalization should be a state-by-state issue. Bush, I feel, shouldn't dictate how the entire country feels about this, as he won't be in office for much longer. If a democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just be another back-and-forth, and the best approach is to let each state decide based on their own values and beliefs.",
            "Some stories just grab your attention...like this one. Um, I don't at all. Um, let’s see, I'm not really sure how to put this. The way I figure it, Myspace is a public thing. It's basically a bulletin board where you post things for everyone to see. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it, whether they're school officials or not. So, I think it's only reasonable that school officials see what's posted on Myspace. Even if it's not under the school's name, they could access it through their homes. But, if it's to prevent something like a school shooting, which is a responsibility of the school system, then I think that's perfectly fine. I feel like it's a public thing, and the school officials aren't invading privacy if they're trying to make the school a safer place. I mean, they go on there just to catch students and get them in trouble, and that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that? Yeah, um, alright, well, um, hmm. It’s a lot easier to express yourself when you’re writing, but, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing. And, with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that’s ridiculous. Um, everything, like I’m worried to post stuff, even through emails, because I’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up. Um, like, everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. Like, you know, if you do something while you’re a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, and they find an email that you sent somehow. And, once it’s on the internet, it’s always on the internet, and there's no way of getting out of it. You will get in trouble, and it wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, it’s a public thing. Um, I don’t know, let’s see here. Like I had said before, I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on. Um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they’re dropping them off at a safe place. I’ve actually discussed that with a teacher of mine. I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff. And, um, that’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks. Uh, we had to be safe about that. We had drill stuff, and even though that doesn’t have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was, you know, in case people would come into the building, I guess. Um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place. And, um, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case. They were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that. Um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with. Uh, no, that’s about it.",
            "I initially supported the war, especially given my personal connection to 9/11. I wanted justice and to cause as much chaos as they did to us. However, I believe we acted irrationally, driven by emotion and anger, without a clear plan. I now question if it was the right decision. The people there, as long as they're fighting each other, won't be fighting with us. I don't think our presence there is making a difference. They're more interested in getting us to leave than improving their own country. We were just looking for revenge, and the president acted on the people's emotions. We couldn't let Iraq get away with attacking us, but I think we could have had a better plan. There was no clear goal or unity. I don't think we're making enough progress to stay there, and I believe that once we leave, the situation will collapse. We're harming ourselves by staying."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in several ways. It's no secret that the institution is experiencing a decline in its flock, and I think this is largely due to its rigid stances on certain issues. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which can be off-putting to many people. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective, I think they would see a decrease in those turning away from their teachings. Many are increasingly finding issue with the Church's views on these subjects, and I feel that they may be losing followers because of it. For instance, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's considered completely wrong. Similarly, those who are in favor of gay marriage might not want to be part of a following that disapproves. While I don't think allowing female priests or married clergy would have necessarily prevented the recent scandals, I believe the Church could benefit from adopting a more modern approach. The notion of priests being 'married to God' and dedicating their lives exclusively to their faith is outdated, especially compared to the modern world where people typically balance their work and personal lives.",
            "Look, I'm not here to argue for or against gay marriage. It's not something I've given much thought to, but I don't think it's right to say that people who are gay shouldn't get married just because they were born that way. It's not a choice, so I don't think they should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but people of the same sex can't. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who these people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's not the government's place to interfere in people's personal lives.",
            "I believe that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There aren't any compelling reasons against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples endanger the traditional family structure, but this perspective overlooks the numerous differences and complexities involved. It's like comparing two sides of a coin; one can never be the same as the other, yet they are fundamentally the same. When it comes to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, marriage offers a way for couples to share responsibilities and support each other. In a relationship, it doesn't matter whether it's between a man and a woman or two men or two women. Homosexual couples have the same relationship factors and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. What people often misunderstand is that married couples aren't asking for religious ceremonies; they just want a legal document from the government. It's like segregation; separate but unequal. The federal government should legalize gay marriage across all states. I'm concerned that President Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies among individuals and groups. Using religious beliefs to create an amendment banning gay marriage is hypocritical, especially when considering recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage, but this is not supported by research. The American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to scientific research instead of popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Now, it's not that illegal drugs are inherently beneficial, but they can have medicinal uses. Personally, I'm not a fan of making those drugs available to the public. However, for medicinal purposes? Absolutely. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial, and I think we should give it a fair shake if it can help people. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's illegal, but pharmacists use it all the time because it has benefits. If we deny that just because of the taboo around marijuana, that's not right.\n\nYou see, there are a lot of drugs that are illegal but have their uses. We should be embracing the benefits of marijuana, not dismissing them just because of its illegal status. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol. Abusing either can lead to bad things, but marijuana isn't as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we remove the stigma, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday in cute dresses and matching shoes. But now, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer. You'll see families running in late, and even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. As for the accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I think those couldn't have been prevented. Men who are married and still become pedophiles—it's not about being allowed to marry or not. It's about the person. When they choose to become priests, they're still attracted to young kids, regardless of their marital status. I think it's more about genetics than upbringing. The church might not have been able to prevent this, but if they knew about it and covered it up, shame on them. I don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "A chuckle escaped me as I reflected on the Iraq War. Initially, I was fine with the idea, but given the lingering trauma from September 11, it seemed like we entered the conflict under false pretenses. The Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, suggesting Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction—a claim that's since proven false. This has always irked me, and the Iraq conflict still gets under my skin.\n\nThe Bush administration's dishonesty didn't stop there. They fed the American people a line of lies and, even now, haven't taken responsibility for it. Colin Powell, for instance, admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially since 9/11. They seem to have entered office with a desire to go to war.\n\nA former Treasury Secretary, whose name I can't recall, alleged that the younger Bush was seeking revenge for his father's administration and expansion of our energy supply—both underhanded motivations. I believe the conflict has dragged on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\n\nThe UN and the U.S. are considering a coalition with regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea. It could exacerbate problems, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a significant issue. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and with the Parliament ineffective and factions vying for control, political instability looms.",
            "You want to discuss the War in Iraq? Alright, let's see. Well, at this point, I feel it's rather pointless. It wasn't even a declared war, right? It was more of a \"get back at Iraq\" thing because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into keeping up with it, to be honest. I don't know the details, but I know we're over there trying to build democracy and get oil, but it's not worth it, as it's causing more unrest and chaos. If we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever. And if we leave, they'll be angry because we messed things up. It's a tough topic.\n\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair, and we're not really calling it a war anymore. We're using guns to show we're strong and American. But I don't think it's a real reason to stay over there. It should have been declared by Congress, but it wasn't. I don't think it's a big point to stay and try to help, as it's wasting our resources. It's making Bush look bad, too. Like in the Vietnam War, it's now called a meaningless war, and he'll be remembered as the president who started it. I'd say it'll go on for years and years. It's hard to want it to end because of the families affected. I don't know, it's complicated.",
            "I simply don't think it's fair or right to legalize it or even for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe any attempt to enforce control over this issue would defy that principle. I feel it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the constitution allows for religious tolerance. Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for some areas like Boston. I don't believe the government should be involved in this debate as it's not about the economy or society's well-being. The President's push for this amendment seems to be more about his personal Catholic beliefs and preferences than anything else. It's not my place to decide what's best for religion, it's up to the churches.",
            "The war in Iraq\nWell, to begin, I don't believe the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though in reality, they didn't have much in common. The government exploited the public's outrage and grief over 9/11 to justify the invasion, which began in 2003. I am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I believe the Iraq War was a repeat of many aspects of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it didn't. The war has resulted in a significant number of American casualties, and the government was unprepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The U.S. removed Iraq's government and tried to implement a democratic one, similar to the Cold War effort in Vietnam. However, the U.S. government should have known that establishing democracy is a long and difficult process. They made it seem like a short, successful mission, which was naive. The war continues today, with many American troops still risking their lives. The U.S. government didn't plan for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They should have known it would take years to successfully implement a new form of government. The decision to vote for George Bush in the 2004 election was influenced by my concern for the people in Iraq. I couldn't abandon them after we took away their government and way of life. However, there's also the consideration of the high American casualties involved. The war in Iraq is a difficult decision because it's incredibly hard to abandon the people we have been helping. I just hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it's unlikely.",
            "Alright, let's dive right in. I've always been in favor of gay marriage, and I think it's a matter of personal preference. It's been increasingly shown that it could be biological, not sociological, so denying people rights based on something they can't control is, in my opinion, inhumane. I'm always an advocate for gay marriage. I don't think politics or government should interfere; it's a personal issue that should be decided at the household level. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs and go about their daily lives without issue. I find it absurd that Bush is trying to dictate how we interpret marriage, especially when people can get married without anyone's notice, but gay couples can't. It's a private matter that should stay private. I've read that it's tied to a chemical predisposition in the brain, not societal influences like being an only child or growing up in a single-parent household. I also think that if a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so quietly, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it becomes a public spectacle. It's a private affair, not something to be dictated by the government. And no, I don't think there's any reason for it to be a matter of national or federal policy.",

            "The war seems to have lasted far too long. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've long since lost sight of that purpose, and our actions now seem more about proving our superpower status. Additionally, there may have been personal agendas involving George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original motivation was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be understandable, but if there were ulterior motives, it would be unjust. Our purpose was initially clear and achieved in the first few months, but the conflict has dragged on for years. It feels like we're prolonging the war to avoid losing face rather than achieving a decisive victory. We've been fighting for too long, and it's time for the other country's government to take charge. We're draining our economy with this endless conflict, and there are pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need our attention. The money spent on this war could be better used to fund our own needs, not to sustain a prolonged conflict that has lost its original cause.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that the incident was averted because someone found some information online. Ok, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. I mean, you accept that people can see your profile if they're your \"friend.\" So, anytime you put information on the internet, you have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. If someone was able to prevent a tragedy by seeing that, then it was a good thing. It's tough, though, because you can't have someone looking at everyone's profiles all the time. That could become a form of discrimination, like, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" It wouldn't be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation, though. Maybe they were looking for evidence that a student was planning something. I don't really know. Sure, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. I'm bothered by the idea of creepy people out there knowing things about me. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in less than a minute, just by looking at her profile. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes IM me, knowing who I am, without me knowing their real name. It's hard because they might know a lot about you, like your interests, what you look like, your class schedule, who your friends are, and all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I have it to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.",
            "You know, I just feel awkward discussing this, honestly. I mean, I'd hate to be lumped in with those who were against the Iraq War from day one, but I really was. It's just, like, why even bother talking about it now? Everyone seems to agree it was a bad idea, except for the administration, of course. I mean, look at the polls. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide think it was a mistake, including eighty percent of Iraqis, and seventy percent of U.S. troops over there think we should pull out within the year. It's been a disaster from the start and pulling out will be just as bad. The situation in the Middle East is a mess, and the culture gap is too huge for us to comprehend or impose our will. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like stepping into quicksand. I don't know what to say about the whole ordeal. I don't see a reason to stick around, but I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas. I haven't heard a legitimate reason why we should stay. If we want to leave gradually, that's fine, but why not just go now? Eighty percent of Iraqis think we should leave within the year, and a quarter think we should leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask and they say yes, at least we can say we tried. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we are now.",
            "Certainly, I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It also affects individuals based on the field of work they're involved in. For instance, in the corporate world, there's the 'glass ceiling'—the unspoken barrier that prevents qualified women from reaching higher positions simply because historically, men have dominated the top echelons of the business world. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home and be the primary caregiver often face societal disapproval, with people questioning why they aren't working instead. In the fashion industry, men often struggle to be taken seriously, as their interests are not typically associated with traditional male roles. These issues stem from deeply ingrained societal expectations and stereotypes. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's essential to continue working towards equality without forcing it too rapidly, as this can lead to resistance. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on other factors such as one's upbringing and education.

While this change has its pros and cons, some of the potential future repercussions are still a concern for people, especially in terms of how it could affect job interviews. On the other end, there's a financial argument too. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. Consequently, some cities, particularly those that are financially struggling, might not be eager to make this change even if it could free up resources. However, in more liberal cities like Denver, the decision to decriminalize marijuana seems to be working well, and the extra money has been used to fund public education, elderly care, and homeless programs. But, I'm not sure I'd want to see it sold in gas stations like cigarettes, with people smoking it everywhere. It's still a bit taboo in many places, and I think it would just feel awkward if it were so widely accepted. Plus, while alcohol can impair your motor skills, marijuana can have more severe effects on people's lives. However, no two people react the same way to substances, and it's hard to generalize. Both alcohol and marijuana have their own negative impacts.",
            "I would agree\nBecause\nWell\nA lot of their practices are very traditional\nLike they've been doing the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to maintain tradition\nBut\nIt’s also essential to be flexible to change\nWell\nMany Catholics believe they must attend Church weekly\nAnd\nThey’re quite strict about how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on those who don’t follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nThey’re not accepting of those who aren’t pure Catholics\nAnd\nThey also reject people of other faiths\nLike\nFor instance\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI apologize\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nJust because of my dad's religion\n\nSo\nThat’s not really\nA tolerant approach\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn that way\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut\nThe Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to adhere to it anyway\n\nI don’t think that would necessarily affect it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily stop them from\nLike\nEngaging in pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nI probably don’t think that would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably occur anyway",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't definitively say who's right or wrong. However, it's certainly one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. On one hand, the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are delicate subjects that can easily offend people. On the other hand, if marriage is considered a sacrament or a union between two people, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or secular context? I think all civil unions, including those between same-sex couples, should be recognized by the government as civil unions rather than marriage. It's about two people committing to each other, not about the nature of their union. If all states can come to a logical conclusion on this matter, they should push to make it federal law. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't broad enough to warrant such a change. It's not a large enough cause to amend the constitution. Simply put, no",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so homosexuality remains a complex issue for me. My close circle includes many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national concern but rather a decision for each state to make individually. This is because many states lean one way or another politically, and I find it unfair for a national leader to impose their views on an issue that largely affects the locals. I believe that every state should decide for itself whether to legalize gay marriage based on its own values and preferences. I don't think President Bush, for instance, should impose his views on the entire country. I understand that he is a democratically elected leader, but I don't agree with his stance on this issue. I think that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own stance on gay marriage, and I believe that his current policy should be left to their discretion. After all, it's the residents of these states who will ultimately face the consequences of such a decision, not the president.",
            "Well, let me break it down. Myspace is, by definition, a public space. Posting something on the internet is akin to shouting it from a hilltop; it's meant to be seen by others. So when school officials access a student's Myspace page, they're not violating any privacy rights. It's like having a conversation in a public forum – you can't expect it to stay private. However, I don't think they should use the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that might make the school safer, then they're doing their job. It's a delicate balance, like how parents expect schools to be safe havens. Lockdown drills and other safety measures aren't about student privacy, they're about preventing tragedies like the ones we've seen. So, I guess they're just doing their duty to keep the school safe. That's my two cents.",
            "Um\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was all for it, as I was personally affected by 9/11\nUm\nI was all for going over there and creating as much chaos as they had here\nUm\nI think that since it was such a raw, emotional event,\nWe overlooked a lot and didn't really think about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of just went over there, unprepared, without a clear plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nUm\nI don’t know\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting among themselves, they can’t be fighting with us\nLike, I don’t think our presence there is gonna make a difference if they can’t even get along\nSo um\nLike unfortunately, because of 9/11, I’ve almost become indifferent to what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care anymore\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war over there is very different from war here\nThey’re just like savage when it comes to war and I don’t think they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that there was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly, I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in several ways. It's no secret that the institution is experiencing a decline in its flock, and I think this is largely due to its rigid stances on certain issues. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which can be off-putting to many people. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective, I think they would see a decrease in those turning away from their teachings. Many are increasingly finding issue with the Church's views on these subjects, and I feel that they may be losing followers because of it. For instance, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's considered completely wrong. Similarly, those who are in favor of gay marriage might not want to be part of a following that disapproves. While I don't think allowing female priests or married clergy would have necessarily prevented the recent scandals, I believe the Church could benefit from adopting a more modern approach. The notion of priests being 'married to God' and dedicating their lives exclusively to their faith is outdated, especially compared to the modern world where people typically balance their work and personal lives.",
            "Look, I'm not here to argue for or against gay marriage. It's not something I've given much thought to, but I don't think it's right to say that people who are gay shouldn't get married just because they were born that way. It's not a choice, so I don't think they should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but people of the same sex can't. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who these people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's not the government's place to interfere in people's personal lives.",
            "I believe that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There aren't any compelling reasons against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples endanger the traditional family structure, but this perspective overlooks the numerous differences and complexities involved. It's like comparing two sides of a coin; one can never be the same as the other, yet they are fundamentally the same. When it comes to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, marriage offers a way for couples to share responsibilities and support each other. In a relationship, it doesn't matter whether it's between a man and a woman or two men or two women. Homosexual couples have the same relationship factors and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. What people often misunderstand is that married couples aren't asking for religious ceremonies; they just want a legal document from the government. It's like segregation; separate but unequal. The federal government should legalize gay marriage across all states. I'm concerned that President Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies among individuals and groups. Using religious beliefs to create an amendment banning gay marriage is hypocritical, especially when considering recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage, but this is not supported by research. The American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to scientific research instead of popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Now, it's not that illegal drugs are inherently beneficial, but they can have medicinal uses. Personally, I'm not a fan of making those drugs available to the public. However, for medicinal purposes? Absolutely. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial, and I think we should give it a fair shake if it can help people. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's illegal, but pharmacists use it all the time because it has benefits. If we deny that just because of the taboo around marijuana, that's not right.\n\nYou see, there are a lot of drugs that are illegal but have their uses. We should be embracing the benefits of marijuana, not dismissing them just because of its illegal status. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol. Abusing either can lead to bad things, but marijuana isn't as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we remove the stigma, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday in cute dresses and matching shoes. But now, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer. You'll see families running in late, and even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. As for the accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I think those couldn't have been prevented. Men who are married and still become pedophiles—it's not about being allowed to marry or not. It's about the person. When they choose to become priests, they're still attracted to young kids, regardless of their marital status. I think it's more about genetics than upbringing. The church might not have been able to prevent this, but if they knew about it and covered it up, shame on them. I don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "A chuckle escaped me as I reflected on the Iraq War. Initially, I was fine with the idea, but given the lingering trauma from September 11, it seemed like we entered the conflict under false pretenses. The Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, suggesting Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction—a claim that's since proven false. This has always irked me, and the Iraq conflict still gets under my skin.\n\nThe Bush administration's dishonesty didn't stop there. They fed the American people a line of lies and, even now, haven't taken responsibility for it. Colin Powell, for instance, admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially since 9/11. They seem to have entered office with a desire to go to war.\n\nA former Treasury Secretary, whose name I can't recall, alleged that the younger Bush was seeking revenge for his father's administration and expansion of our energy supply—both underhanded motivations. I believe the conflict has dragged on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\n\nThe UN and the U.S. are considering a coalition with regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea. It could exacerbate problems, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a significant issue. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and with the Parliament ineffective and factions vying for control, political instability looms.",
            "You want to discuss the War in Iraq? Alright, let's see. Well, at this point, I feel it's rather pointless. It wasn't even a declared war, right? It was more of a \"get back at Iraq\" thing because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into keeping up with it, to be honest. I don't know the details, but I know we're over there trying to build democracy and get oil, but it's not worth it, as it's causing more unrest and chaos. If we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever. And if we leave, they'll be angry because we messed things up. It's a tough topic.\n\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair, and we're not really calling it a war anymore. We're using guns to show we're strong and American. But I don't think it's a real reason to stay over there. It should have been declared by Congress, but it wasn't. I don't think it's a big point to stay and try to help, as it's wasting our resources. It's making Bush look bad, too. Like in the Vietnam War, it's now called a meaningless war, and he'll be remembered as the president who started it. I'd say it'll go on for years and years. It's hard to want it to end because of the families affected. I don't know, it's complicated.",
            "I simply don't think it's fair or right to legalize it or even for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe any attempt to enforce control over this issue would defy that principle. I feel it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the constitution allows for religious tolerance. Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for some areas like Boston. I don't believe the government should be involved in this debate as it's not about the economy or society's well-being. The President's push for this amendment seems to be more about his personal Catholic beliefs and preferences than anything else. It's not my place to decide what's best for religion, it's up to the churches.",
            "The war in Iraq\nWell, to begin, I don't believe the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though in reality, they didn't have much in common. The government exploited the public's outrage and grief over 9/11 to justify the invasion, which began in 2003. I am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I believe the Iraq War was a repeat of many aspects of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it didn't. The war has resulted in a significant number of American casualties, and the government was unprepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The U.S. removed Iraq's government and tried to implement a democratic one, similar to the Cold War effort in Vietnam. However, the U.S. government should have known that establishing democracy is a long and difficult process. They made it seem like a short, successful mission, which was naive. The war continues today, with many American troops still risking their lives. The U.S. government didn't plan for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They should have known it would take years to successfully implement a new form of government. The decision to vote for George Bush in the 2004 election was influenced by my concern for the people in Iraq. I couldn't abandon them after we took away their government and way of life. However, there's also the consideration of the high American casualties involved. The war in Iraq is a difficult decision because it's incredibly hard to abandon the people we have been helping. I just hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it's unlikely.",
            "Alright, let's dive right in. I've always been in favor of gay marriage, and I think it's a matter of personal preference. It's been increasingly shown that it could be biological, not sociological, so denying people rights based on something they can't control is, in my opinion, inhumane. I'm always an advocate for gay marriage. I don't think politics or government should interfere; it's a personal issue that should be decided at the household level. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs and go about their daily lives without issue. I find it absurd that Bush is trying to dictate how we interpret marriage, especially when people can get married without anyone's notice, but gay couples can't. It's a private matter that should stay private. I've read that it's tied to a chemical predisposition in the brain, not societal influences like being an only child or growing up in a single-parent household. I also think that if a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so quietly, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it becomes a public spectacle. It's a private affair, not something to be dictated by the government. And no, I don't think there's any reason for it to be a matter of national or federal policy.",

            "The war seems to have lasted far too long. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've long since lost sight of that purpose, and our actions now seem more about proving our superpower status. Additionally, there may have been personal agendas involving George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original motivation was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be understandable, but if there were ulterior motives, it would be unjust. Our purpose was initially clear and achieved in the first few months, but the conflict has dragged on for years. It feels like we're prolonging the war to avoid losing face rather than achieving a decisive victory. We've been fighting for too long, and it's time for the other country's government to take charge. We're draining our economy with this endless conflict, and there are pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need our attention. The money spent on this war could be better used to fund our own needs, not to sustain a prolonged conflict that has lost its original cause.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that the incident was averted because someone found some information online. Ok, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. I mean, you accept that people can see your profile if they're your \"friend.\" So, anytime you put information on the internet, you have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. If someone was able to prevent a tragedy by seeing that, then it was a good thing. It's tough, though, because you can't have someone looking at everyone's profiles all the time. That could become a form of discrimination, like, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" It wouldn't be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation, though. Maybe they were looking for evidence that a student was planning something. I don't really know. Sure, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. I'm bothered by the idea of creepy people out there knowing things about me. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in less than a minute, just by looking at her profile. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes IM me, knowing who I am, without me knowing their real name. It's hard because they might know a lot about you, like your interests, what you look like, your class schedule, who your friends are, and all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I have it to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.",
            "You know, I just feel awkward discussing this, honestly. I mean, I'd hate to be lumped in with those who were against the Iraq War from day one, but I really was. It's just, like, why even bother talking about it now? Everyone seems to agree it was a bad idea, except for the administration, of course. I mean, look at the polls. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide think it was a mistake, including eighty percent of Iraqis, and seventy percent of U.S. troops over there think we should pull out within the year. It's been a disaster from the start and pulling out will be just as bad. The situation in the Middle East is a mess, and the culture gap is too huge for us to comprehend or impose our will. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like stepping into quicksand. I don't know what to say about the whole ordeal. I don't see a reason to stick around, but I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas. I haven't heard a legitimate reason why we should stay. If we want to leave gradually, that's fine, but why not just go now? Eighty percent of Iraqis think we should leave within the year, and a quarter think we should leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask and they say yes, at least we can say we tried. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we are now.",
            "Certainly, I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It also affects individuals based on the field of work they're involved in. For instance, in the corporate world, there's the 'glass ceiling'—the unspoken barrier that prevents qualified women from reaching higher positions simply because historically, men have dominated the top echelons of the business world. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home and be the primary caregiver often face societal disapproval, with people questioning why they aren't working instead. In the fashion industry, men often struggle to be taken seriously, as their interests are not typically associated with traditional male roles. These issues stem from deeply ingrained societal expectations and stereotypes. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's essential to continue working towards equality without forcing it too rapidly, as this can lead to resistance. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on other factors such as one's upbringing and education.

While this change has its pros and cons, some of the potential future repercussions are still a concern for people, especially in terms of how it could affect job interviews. On the other end, there's a financial argument too. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. Consequently, some cities, particularly those that are financially struggling, might not be eager to make this change even if it could free up resources. However, in more liberal cities like Denver, the decision to decriminalize marijuana seems to be working well, and the extra money has been used to fund public education, elderly care, and homeless programs. But, I'm not sure I'd want to see it sold in gas stations like cigarettes, with people smoking it everywhere. It's still a bit taboo in many places, and I think it would just feel awkward if it were so widely accepted. Plus, while alcohol can impair your motor skills, marijuana can have more severe effects on people's lives. However, no two people react the same way to substances, and it's hard to generalize. Both alcohol and marijuana have their own negative impacts.",
            "I would agree\nBecause\nWell\nA lot of their practices are very traditional\nLike they've been doing the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to maintain tradition\nBut\nIt’s also essential to be flexible to change\nWell\nMany Catholics believe they must attend Church weekly\nAnd\nThey’re quite strict about how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on those who don’t follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nThey’re not accepting of those who aren’t pure Catholics\nAnd\nThey also reject people of other faiths\nLike\nFor instance\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI apologize\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nJust because of my dad's religion\n\nSo\nThat’s not really\nA tolerant approach\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn that way\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut\nThe Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to adhere to it anyway\n\nI don’t think that would necessarily affect it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily stop them from\nLike\nEngaging in pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nI probably don’t think that would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably occur anyway",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't definitively say who's right or wrong. However, it's certainly one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. On one hand, the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are delicate subjects that can easily offend people. On the other hand, if marriage is considered a sacrament or a union between two people, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or secular context? I think all civil unions, including those between same-sex couples, should be recognized by the government as civil unions rather than marriage. It's about two people committing to each other, not about the nature of their union. If all states can come to a logical conclusion on this matter, they should push to make it federal law. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't broad enough to warrant such a change. It's not a large enough cause to amend the constitution. Simply put, no",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so homosexuality remains a complex issue for me. My close circle includes many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national concern but rather a decision for each state to make individually. This is because many states lean one way or another politically, and I find it unfair for a national leader to impose their views on an issue that largely affects the locals. I believe that every state should decide for itself whether to legalize gay marriage based on its own values and preferences. I don't think President Bush, for instance, should impose his views on the entire country. I understand that he is a democratically elected leader, but I don't agree with his stance on this issue. I think that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own stance on gay marriage, and I believe that his current policy should be left to their discretion. After all, it's the residents of these states who will ultimately face the consequences of such a decision, not the president.",
            "Well, let me break it down. Myspace is, by definition, a public space. Posting something on the internet is akin to shouting it from a hilltop; it's meant to be seen by others. So when school officials access a student's Myspace page, they're not violating any privacy rights. It's like having a conversation in a public forum – you can't expect it to stay private. However, I don't think they should use the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that might make the school safer, then they're doing their job. It's a delicate balance, like how parents expect schools to be safe havens. Lockdown drills and other safety measures aren't about student privacy, they're about preventing tragedies like the ones we've seen. So, I guess they're just doing their duty to keep the school safe. That's my two cents.",
            "Um\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was all for it, as I was personally affected by 9/11\nUm\nI was all for going over there and creating as much chaos as they had here\nUm\nI think that since it was such a raw, emotional event,\nWe overlooked a lot and didn't really think about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of just went over there, unprepared, without a clear plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nUm\nI don’t know\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting among themselves, they can’t be fighting with us\nLike, I don’t think our presence there is gonna make a difference if they can’t even get along\nSo um\nLike unfortunately, because of 9/11, I’ve almost become indifferent to what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care anymore\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war over there is very different from war here\nThey’re just like savage when it comes to war and I don’t think they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that there was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly, I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in several ways. It's no secret that the institution is experiencing a decline in its flock, and I think this is largely due to its rigid stances on certain issues. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which can be off-putting to many people. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective, I think they would see a decrease in those turning away from their teachings. Many are increasingly finding issue with the Church's views on these subjects, and I feel that they may be losing followers because of it. For instance, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's considered completely wrong. Similarly, those who are in favor of gay marriage might not want to be part of a following that disapproves. While I don't think allowing female priests or married clergy would have necessarily prevented the recent scandals, I believe the Church could benefit from adopting a more modern approach. The notion of priests being 'married to God' and dedicating their lives exclusively to their faith is outdated, especially compared to the modern world where people typically balance their work and personal lives.",
            "Look, I'm not here to argue for or against gay marriage. It's not something I've given much thought to, but I don't think it's right to say that people who are gay shouldn't get married just because they were born that way. It's not a choice, so I don't think they should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but people of the same sex can't. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who these people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's not the government's place to interfere in people's personal lives.",
            "I believe that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There aren't any compelling reasons against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples endanger the traditional family structure, but this perspective overlooks the numerous differences and complexities involved. It's like comparing two sides of a coin; one can never be the same as the other, yet they are fundamentally the same. When it comes to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, marriage offers a way for couples to share responsibilities and support each other. In a relationship, it doesn't matter whether it's between a man and a woman or two men or two women. Homosexual couples have the same relationship factors and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. What people often misunderstand is that married couples aren't asking for religious ceremonies; they just want a legal document from the government. It's like segregation; separate but unequal. The federal government should legalize gay marriage across all states. I'm concerned that President Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies among individuals and groups. Using religious beliefs to create an amendment banning gay marriage is hypocritical, especially when considering recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage, but this is not supported by research. The American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to scientific research instead of popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Now, it's not that illegal drugs are inherently beneficial, but they can have medicinal uses. Personally, I'm not a fan of making those drugs available to the public. However, for medicinal purposes? Absolutely. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial, and I think we should give it a fair shake if it can help people. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's illegal, but pharmacists use it all the time because it has benefits. If we deny that just because of the taboo around marijuana, that's not right.\n\nYou see, there are a lot of drugs that are illegal but have their uses. We should be embracing the benefits of marijuana, not dismissing them just because of its illegal status. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol. Abusing either can lead to bad things, but marijuana isn't as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we remove the stigma, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I'd go to church every Sunday in cute dresses and matching shoes. But now, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer. You'll see families running in late, and even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. As for the accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I think those couldn't have been prevented. Men who are married and still become pedophiles—it's not about being allowed to marry or not. It's about the person. When they choose to become priests, they're still attracted to young kids, regardless of their marital status. I think it's more about genetics than upbringing. The church might not have been able to prevent this, but if they knew about it and covered it up, shame on them. I don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "A chuckle escaped me as I reflected on the Iraq War. Initially, I was fine with the idea, but given the lingering trauma from September 11, it seemed like we entered the conflict under false pretenses. The Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, suggesting Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction—a claim that's since proven false. This has always irked me, and the Iraq conflict still gets under my skin.\n\nThe Bush administration's dishonesty didn't stop there. They fed the American people a line of lies and, even now, haven't taken responsibility for it. Colin Powell, for instance, admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially since 9/11. They seem to have entered office with a desire to go to war.\n\nA former Treasury Secretary, whose name I can't recall, alleged that the younger Bush was seeking revenge for his father's administration and expansion of our energy supply—both underhanded motivations. I believe the conflict has dragged on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\n\nThe UN and the U.S. are considering a coalition with regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea. It could exacerbate problems, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a significant issue. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and with the Parliament ineffective and factions vying for control, political instability looms.",
            "You want to discuss the War in Iraq? Alright, let's see. Well, at this point, I feel it's rather pointless. It wasn't even a declared war, right? It was more of a \"get back at Iraq\" thing because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really into keeping up with it, to be honest. I don't know the details, but I know we're over there trying to build democracy and get oil, but it's not worth it, as it's causing more unrest and chaos. If we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever. And if we leave, they'll be angry because we messed things up. It's a tough topic.\n\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair, and we're not really calling it a war anymore. We're using guns to show we're strong and American. But I don't think it's a real reason to stay over there. It should have been declared by Congress, but it wasn't. I don't think it's a big point to stay and try to help, as it's wasting our resources. It's making Bush look bad, too. Like in the Vietnam War, it's now called a meaningless war, and he'll be remembered as the president who started it. I'd say it'll go on for years and years. It's hard to want it to end because of the families affected. I don't know, it's complicated.",
            "I simply don't think it's fair or right to legalize it or even for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe any attempt to enforce control over this issue would defy that principle. I feel it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the constitution allows for religious tolerance. Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for some areas like Boston. I don't believe the government should be involved in this debate as it's not about the economy or society's well-being. The President's push for this amendment seems to be more about his personal Catholic beliefs and preferences than anything else. It's not my place to decide what's best for religion, it's up to the churches.",
            "The war in Iraq\nWell, to begin, I don't believe the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though in reality, they didn't have much in common. The government exploited the public's outrage and grief over 9/11 to justify the invasion, which began in 2003. I am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I believe the Iraq War was a repeat of many aspects of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but it didn't. The war has resulted in a significant number of American casualties, and the government was unprepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The U.S. removed Iraq's government and tried to implement a democratic one, similar to the Cold War effort in Vietnam. However, the U.S. government should have known that establishing democracy is a long and difficult process. They made it seem like a short, successful mission, which was naive. The war continues today, with many American troops still risking their lives. The U.S. government didn't plan for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They should have known it would take years to successfully implement a new form of government. The decision to vote for George Bush in the 2004 election was influenced by my concern for the people in Iraq. I couldn't abandon them after we took away their government and way of life. However, there's also the consideration of the high American casualties involved. The war in Iraq is a difficult decision because it's incredibly hard to abandon the people we have been helping. I just hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it's unlikely.",
            "Alright, let's dive right in. I've always been in favor of gay marriage, and I think it's a matter of personal preference. It's been increasingly shown that it could be biological, not sociological, so denying people rights based on something they can't control is, in my opinion, inhumane. I'm always an advocate for gay marriage. I don't think politics or government should interfere; it's a personal issue that should be decided at the household level. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs and go about their daily lives without issue. I find it absurd that Bush is trying to dictate how we interpret marriage, especially when people can get married without anyone's notice, but gay couples can't. It's a private matter that should stay private. I've read that it's tied to a chemical predisposition in the brain, not societal influences like being an only child or growing up in a single-parent household. I also think that if a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so quietly, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it becomes a public spectacle. It's a private affair, not something to be dictated by the government. And no, I don't think there's any reason for it to be a matter of national or federal policy.",

            "The war seems to have lasted far too long. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've long since lost sight of that purpose, and our actions now seem more about proving our superpower status. Additionally, there may have been personal agendas involving George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original motivation was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be understandable, but if there were ulterior motives, it would be unjust. Our purpose was initially clear and achieved in the first few months, but the conflict has dragged on for years. It feels like we're prolonging the war to avoid losing face rather than achieving a decisive victory. We've been fighting for too long, and it's time for the other country's government to take charge. We're draining our economy with this endless conflict, and there are pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need our attention. The money spent on this war could be better used to fund our own needs, not to sustain a prolonged conflict that has lost its original cause.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that the incident was averted because someone found some information online. Ok, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. I mean, you accept that people can see your profile if they're your \"friend.\" So, anytime you put information on the internet, you have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. If someone was able to prevent a tragedy by seeing that, then it was a good thing. It's tough, though, because you can't have someone looking at everyone's profiles all the time. That could become a form of discrimination, like, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" It wouldn't be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation, though. Maybe they were looking for evidence that a student was planning something. I don't really know. Sure, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. I'm bothered by the idea of creepy people out there knowing things about me. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in less than a minute, just by looking at her profile. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes IM me, knowing who I am, without me knowing their real name. It's hard because they might know a lot about you, like your interests, what you look like, your class schedule, who your friends are, and all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I have it to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can look at what.",
            "You know, I just feel awkward discussing this, honestly. I mean, I'd hate to be lumped in with those who were against the Iraq War from day one, but I really was. It's just, like, why even bother talking about it now? Everyone seems to agree it was a bad idea, except for the administration, of course. I mean, look at the polls. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide think it was a mistake, including eighty percent of Iraqis, and seventy percent of U.S. troops over there think we should pull out within the year. It's been a disaster from the start and pulling out will be just as bad. The situation in the Middle East is a mess, and the culture gap is too huge for us to comprehend or impose our will. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like stepping into quicksand. I don't know what to say about the whole ordeal. I don't see a reason to stick around, but I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas. I haven't heard a legitimate reason why we should stay. If we want to leave gradually, that's fine, but why not just go now? Eighty percent of Iraqis think we should leave within the year, and a quarter think we should leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask and they say yes, at least we can say we tried. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we are now.",
            "Certainly, I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It also affects individuals based on the field of work they're involved in. For instance, in the corporate world, there's the 'glass ceiling'—the unspoken barrier that prevents qualified women from reaching higher positions simply because historically, men have dominated the top echelons of the business world. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home and be the primary caregiver often face societal disapproval, with people questioning why they aren't working instead. In the fashion industry, men often struggle to be taken seriously, as their interests are not typically associated with traditional male roles. These issues stem from deeply ingrained societal expectations and stereotypes. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's essential to continue working towards equality without forcing it too rapidly, as this can lead to resistance. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on other factors such as one's upbringing and education.

While this change has its pros and cons, some of the potential future repercussions are still a concern for people, especially in terms of how it could affect job interviews. On the other end, there's a financial argument too. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. Consequently, some cities, particularly those that are financially struggling, might not be eager to make this change even if it could free up resources. However, in more liberal cities like Denver, the decision to decriminalize marijuana seems to be working well, and the extra money has been used to fund public education, elderly care, and homeless programs. But, I'm not sure I'd want to see it sold in gas stations like cigarettes, with people smoking it everywhere. It's still a bit taboo in many places, and I think it would just feel awkward if it were so widely accepted. Plus, while alcohol can impair your motor skills, marijuana can have more severe effects on people's lives. However, no two people react the same way to substances, and it's hard to generalize. Both alcohol and marijuana have their own negative impacts.",
            "I would agree\nBecause\nWell\nA lot of their practices are very traditional\nLike they've been doing the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to maintain tradition\nBut\nIt’s also essential to be flexible to change\nWell\nMany Catholics believe they must attend Church weekly\nAnd\nThey’re quite strict about how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on those who don’t follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nThey’re not accepting of those who aren’t pure Catholics\nAnd\nThey also reject people of other faiths\nLike\nFor instance\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI apologize\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nJust because of my dad's religion\n\nSo\nThat’s not really\nA tolerant approach\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn that way\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut\nThe Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to adhere to it anyway\n\nI don’t think that would necessarily affect it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily stop them from\nLike\nEngaging in pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nI probably don’t think that would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably occur anyway",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't definitively say who's right or wrong. However, it's certainly one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. On one hand, the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are delicate subjects that can easily offend people. On the other hand, if marriage is considered a sacrament or a union between two people, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or secular context? I think all civil unions, including those between same-sex couples, should be recognized by the government as civil unions rather than marriage. It's about two people committing to each other, not about the nature of their union. If all states can come to a logical conclusion on this matter, they should push to make it federal law. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't broad enough to warrant such a change. It's not a large enough cause to amend the constitution. Simply put, no",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so homosexuality remains a complex issue for me. My close circle includes many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national concern but rather a decision for each state to make individually. This is because many states lean one way or another politically, and I find it unfair for a national leader to impose their views on an issue that largely affects the locals. I believe that every state should decide for itself whether to legalize gay marriage based on its own values and preferences. I don't think President Bush, for instance, should impose his views on the entire country. I understand that he is a democratically elected leader, but I don't agree with his stance on this issue. I think that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own stance on gay marriage, and I believe that his current policy should be left to their discretion. After all, it's the residents of these states who will ultimately face the consequences of such a decision, not the president.",
            "Well, let me break it down. Myspace is, by definition, a public space. Posting something on the internet is akin to shouting it from a hilltop; it's meant to be seen by others. So when school officials access a student's Myspace page, they're not violating any privacy rights. It's like having a conversation in a public forum – you can't expect it to stay private. However, I don't think they should use the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that might make the school safer, then they're doing their job. It's a delicate balance, like how parents expect schools to be safe havens. Lockdown drills and other safety measures aren't about student privacy, they're about preventing tragedies like the ones we've seen. So, I guess they're just doing their duty to keep the school safe. That's my two cents.",
            "Um\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was all for it, as I was personally affected by 9/11\nUm\nI was all for going over there and creating as much chaos as they had here\nUm\nI think that since it was such a raw, emotional event,\nWe overlooked a lot and didn't really think about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of just went over there, unprepared, without a clear plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nUm\nI don’t know\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting among themselves, they can’t be fighting with us\nLike, I don’t think our presence there is gonna make a difference if they can’t even get along\nSo um\nLike unfortunately, because of 9/11, I’ve almost become indifferent to what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care anymore\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war over there is very different from war here\nThey’re just like savage when it comes to war and I don’t think they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that there was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly, I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces several challenges that could be addressed by adapting its views. It seems to be losing some of its followers due to its strict stances on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while traditional, may not resonate with a modern audience. Some people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. For instance, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, it might be difficult to feel comfortable in a community where these beliefs are viewed as wrong. While introducing female priests or allowing priests to marry might not have prevented recent scandals, it could potentially address some of the Church's modern issues. Moreover, it’s unclear why priests should be denied the same life balance that other professionals enjoy.",
            "You know, I'm really not against gay marriage. I mean, it's not like it's something people choose to be. Whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you decide. I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't thought about it much, but I definitely think that's wrong.\n\nYou see, it's not like a choice. People don't choose to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. I mean, I think it's more about how you're born. If someone is gay, they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security issue or a moral concern. It's just not their place to interfere in people's lives. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nNo, that's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There isn't a compelling argument against it. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to heterosexual families, but that's just one aspect of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - it's not the same thing. There are numerous civil rights at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare. For instance, if a gay couple is together, their partner can't be in the hospital room or visit them due to their lack of legal recognition. I think it's silly to deny these rights to people who have committed to spend their lives together. Moreover, scientific studies show that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They're just two sides of the same coin. People often get hung up on the idea of gay marriage not being recognized by churches, but a marriage certificate is a legal document provided by the government, not a religious one. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same legal recognition as heterosexual couples. People also worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and society. Some cities, like New York, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying in regular schools. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide. I'm not sure about President Bush's views on this issue, but I think his stance is more about his religion than research. Most of the reasons I've heard are moral, but morality varies greatly among people. To base laws on the moral beliefs of one group while ignoring others is hypocritical, especially given the recent controversy over the 'under God' phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe it's a result of childhood trauma or personality defects, which is not supported by research. If people listened to institutions that conduct studies on these topics rather than popular opinion, their perspectives might change.",
            "Well, first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I want to set a few things straight. Sure, a drug might be illegal, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily beneficial. Just because a substance is unavailable to the public doesn't mean it's not useful. I'd say absolutely not to make it widely available, but I'm not against using it for medicinal purposes. That's because just because a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it's beneficial—it's just not. You understand what I'm saying?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are controlled substances, but we use them because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of a drug just because it's taboo shouldn't apply to marijuana. We should embrace its beneficial properties.\n\nI don't think it's exactly like alcohol—abuse of either can lead to issues, but marijuana isn't as harmful as heroine or cocaine. I'd say integrating it gradually, making it legal step by step, would be the way to go. That way, it wouldn't be abused, but first, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.\n\nI mean, people have a really negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not as bad as some others. Once we get rid of that negative perception, people might be able to use it responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes. But that's not going to happen overnight.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to keep up with the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I can attest to this from my own experience. When I was a child, I'd wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse every Sunday, attending church with my friends from my private school. Now, as I've grown older, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often arrive late, and even during regular morning services, folks come in jeans and khakis. I think this reflects a broader shift towards a more casual atmosphere. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is not a character flaw that can be avoided by marriage or lack thereof. It's often a genetic predisposition that can't be hidden, and the church, in many cases, may not have known about the abuse. I don't think the church could have done more to prevent this.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We went into Iraq under false pretenses, connecting the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false. This really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just makes me furious. It feels like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider that a serious breach of office, an impeachable offense. They've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. They came into office with the intention to go to war. The former Treasury Secretary made allegations in his book about this, saying the younger Bush had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration and was also aiming to secure more energy supplies. I think it's time for this war to end. While I agree that pulling out now could cause chaos and more deaths, I'm not sure about the proposed coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. In the long run, this could cause more problems, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament ineffective and major political factions vying for control. The situation can get quite heated. None of this is easy to articulate in polite company.",
            "Oh, I suppose I could just say it into the microphone, huh? Okay, cool. Yeah, sure. So, you want to talk about the War in Iraq? Alright, let me see. Well, I mean, at this point, it feels kind of pointless because, well, it hasn't really been declared a war, you know? And it seemed like we were just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks since we thought they were behind it. I'm not really into the whole War on Iraq thing, to be honest. I don't follow it closely, but I know we're there trying to build democracy and stuff, and maybe even get some oil. But it's not like we're there for a good reason. If we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, we'll just mess everything up and they'll have to start over. This topic is tough. I don't know much about it.\n\nUm, let me see. Okay, actually, I think the war should continue, but I don't think we should call it a war anymore. I mean, we're not really using it to wage a war; we're just showing off our strength and stuff. But I don't really think it's worth it anymore because Congress never declared it a real war. You have to by law, right? So, it's not really a declared war.\n\nI don't think it's a big point to stay over there and try to help them, but it is a point to help them. It's just a waste of our resources, and it's making Bush look bad because of what it's doing. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, but worse.\n\nHmm, it's hard to say if I want the war to end because there are families I know whose kids are over there, and I don't want them to be in danger. But then again, it's hard to say if we should stay because our culture is so different from theirs, and if we mold them into being like us, it could make things worse. And the whole Al-Qaeda thing will just get bigger and their hatred for us will grow. I think this whole situation will go on for years and years.\n\nThat's about it, I guess.",
            "I seriously don't feel it’s right to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. I think it should be left to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a fundamental principle that any attempt to impose power over it would be a defiance of the Constitution. I believe that those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, since the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it. I don’t think the government should decide what is legal or illegal for churches. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution, and adding an amendment to restrict it would contradict what's already in place. Plus, it would be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see any valid reasons for an amendment, other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "The Iraq war is a controversial topic that has sparked numerous debates. I believe the government didn't fully disclose the true reasons behind the invasion to the American people. They attempted to link it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, Iraq had little to do with those events. However, the government played on the emotions of the public, which were still raw following the attacks, to justify the invasion that began in 2003.\n\nI am generally opposed to war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. I believe the Iraq war is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they did not. The removal of Iraq's government and the subsequent chaos and power vacuum were not properly planned for by the U.S. government.\n\nThe American government is still attempting to train Iraqi troops and police forces but has not yet succeeded in establishing a stable government. This situation is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where the U.S. tried to impose democracy on a resistant population. I think the government underplayed the complexity and length of this process, making it seem like a quicker and easier task than it actually was.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq is a difficult one. On the one hand, once you commit to a war, it's hard to abandon those you've helped. On the other hand, the number of American casualties is alarming, and it's crucial to consider whether the risk is worth the potential reward of a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, the oil issue is a significant factor in the U.S. government's decisions regarding Iraq and other nations.\n\nI hope that the war will end soon and that peace will be restored in Iraq, but I am doubtful that this will happen soon.",
            "I’m in favor of gay marriage; I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice, and evidence suggests it may have biological rather than societal roots. It seems inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control. I've long been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government should stay out of it; it's a personal, household issue, not a state matter. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, functioning just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage as a divine institution seems laughable. I've heard from various sources that sexual orientation may be influenced by biology, not just upbringing. For instance, a person might be predisposed to be homosexual due to chemical factors in the brain. Moreover, unlike heterosexual couples who can marry in secret, gay couples attract public attention, making it a private matter. It's just not fair that it's become a public and federal issue.",
            "Ahem, when one shares something online, it becomes public domain. It's out there for anyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've dealt with situations where someone's online content has caused concern. You see, the internet is a global forum, and if you're friends with someone on MySpace, you'll see their updates. When something like this happens at a school, it can't be ignored. Someone might overhear a comment, and if it's serious, like угрозы or plans for harm, the authorities must take action. However, one cannot control how others interpret online content. People might post things as jokes, but in certain contexts, they can be taken seriously. This happened at our school. Someone overheard a comment and reported it. When they checked the student's Facebook, they found some concerning content. The student's friend suggested it was a joke, but the severity of the situation meant the school had to act. Posting on the internet implies no expectation of privacy, so if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. Even if school officials have access, they shouldn't monitor students' online activities unless there's a genuine reason to. A teacher shouldn't friend students on social media or use fake profiles to monitor them. I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. I don't want to know about their personal activities, and I certainly don't want to deal with their online content. It's not my responsibility.",
            "I believe the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in another nation. However, I fear we've lost sight of this original purpose and now seem to be engaged in warfare for the sake of proving our might as a world superpower. This is further complicated by potential personal motivations stemming from George W. Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe original intention, if it indeed was to democratize a country under a tyrannical regime, was valid. But over time, our rationale has become distorted and misplaced. It appears we're now at war merely to wage war, seeking a decisive victory. The conflict has dragged on long enough, and it’s time to let the local government and officials stand on their own. Our economy is being drained with billions spent on a war whose cause has long since evaporated.\n\nBillions are being spent, and war should not be a prolonged part of our budget. There are pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure improvements (like public roads and schools), and healthcare that desperately need funding. This money could be better allocated towards resolving these pressing issues rather than being spent on a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose.\n\nI think that's all.",
            "I have a question to clarify something. It seems that someone found out some information online, which prevented a tragedy. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, though. If you post something on a site like Myspace or Facebook, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. You have to accept that when you give people access to your profile. I understand that it's not practical to have one person monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues, but it raises concerns about discrimination or spying. It's a bit tricky because you can never know who's looking at your information. I've experienced it myself with Facebook. There are creepy people out there who can easily find out personal details. I've seen cases where strangers have contacted people within minutes, and it's concerning. I only accept people I know on Facebook, but it's still a challenge. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school had that right, but it's an interesting debate.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nIt's awkward for me to bring it up\nI mean, I hate to appear as if I'm jumping on the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but it's not crucial now\nBecause, in general, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to see the recent polls\nUm\nThey've conducted surveys in the U.S., Iraq, and globally\nAnd I mean, no one likes\nAbout seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops over there\nLike the U.S. troops\nThink it was a terrible idea and want us to leave within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a mess\nAnd pulling out is going to be just as problematic\nThere’s really no easy way to navigate the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the cultural disconnect between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it's just too big a gap\nAnd previous administrations didn’t seem to understand\nAnd they think they can impose democracy in areas where it isn't wanted\nLike that’s not the way\nThese people would choose to govern themselves\nUm\nI mean, sure, Saddam was awful\nI don't think anyone's arguing that\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will turn into a disaster\nLike we've seen in Iraq\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas about staying\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from us leaving\nI don’t buy them\nI haven’t heard a solid reason why we should stay longer than necessary\nUm\nI mean, if they want to gradually withdraw over a year or so\nUm\nI wouldn’t really have an issue with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and a quarter of them want us to leave now\nAnd like these are the people we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes\nYou know, it wouldn’t be our fault if something goes wrong\nYou know, if things go south, we can say we were planning to stay but you guys decided otherwise\nUm\nAnd then you know, if we decide to help out after that\nWe’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nUm\nNo\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Certainly, I do feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not merely about women; it also pertains to specific fields of work. Overall, women may face more challenges due to the glass ceiling, making it difficult for many to secure higher positions. This often stems from societal conditioning over decades. For instance, a woman might be qualified for a job but not promoted due to historical bias against women in leadership roles. Similarly, men may encounter discrimination, such as being frowned upon for staying at home as a parent or being involved in fields like fashion.\n\nIn the fashion industry, males often struggle to be taken seriously if they are straight and express interest in the field. This is because society often associates fashion with a different lifestyle for men. Additionally, individuals may face discrimination based on their socio-economic background. For example, someone from a rural area might be held back in their career due to perceived language or grammar skills, despite being highly intelligent. Discrimination can also occur from one gender to another based on their role or upbringing.\n\nTo address these issues, societal mindsets need to evolve slowly to avoid resistance. The progress we've made is significant, but change is a gradual process. Women ascending into high positions and men taking on stay-at-home roles are becoming more accepted, but these shifts take time. Promoting diversity subtly by highlighting the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help. Society is already moving in the right direction, and pushing too hard could lead to resistance.",
            "Well, what I grasp is that they didn't legalize it, rather they decriminalized it, which downgraded it from a criminal offense to something akin to a traffic citation. You know, like getting cited for something minor rather than being booked, arrested, and brought in. If someone gets caught and cited, it might affect job interviews or other significant areas of life, similar to having a drug charge. While it's true that decriminalizing marijuana doesn't erase all potential future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on the legal system and the associated costs, which are substantial. This includes expenses for arrests, court appearances, public defenders, and more. Communities facing financial hardship may be reluctant to make such a concession, even if it could free up funds for other public services. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards cannabis are more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as beneficial. I believe it has allowed Denver to invest more in education, social programs for the elderly, and assistance for the homeless. It’s important to note that marijuana itself isn’t something to be freely available everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still considered taboo in many contexts. If it were fully legalized, you might see it being smoked openly, which could be awkward for many. Additionally, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more profound impact on one's lifestyle. Both substances have their adverse effects, and how people react to them varies greatly. No two individuals experience them the same way. Some react normally, while others struggle with moderation. Therefore, it's challenging to generalize about the effects of these substances on different people.",
            "I'd say yes,\nMany of their practices are quite traditional, having been done for long periods.\nIt's beneficial to hold onto tradition, but it's also crucial to adapt to change.\nSome Catholics believe they must attend church weekly and are strict about their rituals.\nSometimes, I feel the Catholic Church is judgmental of those who don't strictly follow the doctrine.\nThey often don't accept people of other religions or those who aren't 'perfect' Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents couldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\nThat's not exactly open-minded to other religions, is it?\nWe were taught to love others, but it feels hypocritical to turn away those who don't fit the mold.\nMany Catholic teachings and practices seem outdated, yet they hold onto them.\nPersonally, I think allowing priests to marry could be a good idea, but I don't believe it would prevent pedophilic behavior.\nIt's a separate issue, and I doubt it would be a problem.\nChild molestation is a complex issue, happening regardless of marital status, as it involves children, not adults.\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such behavior.",
            "Well,\nI'm just not sure how I feel about this issue yet.\nI'm still trying to sort this out in my head.\nIt seems like we're tackling a tricky subject here, one that's right in the middle of the debate about the separation of church and state.\nHow do we define marriage without upsetting anyone?\nIt gets really tricky.\nI mean, if civil unions are good enough for everyone else, why not for gay couples too?\nIsn't it just about two people coming together?\nShouldn't the government treat it as such, without delving into the sacrament part?\nI think if all states come to a reasonable agreement, they should push for a federal law.\nBut amending the constitution to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous.\nIt's not a big enough cause to amend the constitution.\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution for something like this.",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so the topic of homosexuality lies in a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. It's not a national issue that the president should decide for the entire country. Instead, I think each state should have the autonomy to decide based on their own values and beliefs.\n\nI understand that many states lean towards the Democratic Party, where attitudes towards gay marriage are more liberal. If you live in such a state, it's reasonable to accept their position. After all, you chose to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and therefore, each state should be allowed to legalize it based on their own discretion.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush has the authority to impose his views on the entire country. He shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. He'll be out of office soon enough, and if a Democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just revert back and forth. It's best to leave these decisions to the individual states, as they'll be living with the consequences, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",
            "Well, let me break it down for you. Myspace, at its core, is a public platform, and anything you post there is intended for public consumption. That's the whole point. If you put something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. In my opinion, if school officials see something on Myspace that could potentially prevent a school shooting, they have every right to check it out. It's part of their responsibility to ensure the safety of the students.\n\nBut let's not forget, if school officials start snooping around on the internet just to catch students in trouble, that's a clear invasion of privacy. However, if they come across something that genuinely makes the school safer, then I'm all for it. It's a fine line, but it's all about the greater good.\n\nNow, I'm not saying they should be constantly monitoring students' profiles, but if they stumble upon something that could help prevent tragedy, then they shouldn't hesitate. There's a reason parents send their kids to school - they expect a safe environment. And if schools practice safety drills and take measures to prevent incidents like Columbine, it's for a reason.\n\nSo, in summary, while I think it's important to respect privacy, when it comes to the safety of the students, school officials should not be afraid to use whatever resources they have to ensure their safety.",
            "Oh\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nInitially, I was all for it. After all, I was deeply affected by 9/11. I wanted to retaliate, to create as much chaos as they had caused here. But with the benefit of hindsight, I think we overlooked a lot of important aspects. We were driven by emotion and anger, and we didn't consider the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and I really think it backfired on us. I don't know... I was initially for it, but now I'm very much against it. I don't think it has achieved anything. I believe that as long as they're fighting among themselves, they won't be fighting us. Like I don't think our presence there will make any difference if they can't even get along with each other. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've become almost indifferent to what goes on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. I think they're just fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. I just don't care. Um, we definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't anticipate what we'd face over there. And it's also problematic because war is very different for them compared to us. They're more savage in their approach to war, and I don't think they have any interest in improving their country. I think they just want us out. And I think that's acceptable for us. We should just leave, and that's it. Um, we were more like hyped up than anything. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences or how they would react if we tried to change their whole way of life. We went over there looking for revenge, and I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people wanted it, and he felt he had no choice. Um, but at the time, I understood where he was coming from. We couldn't just let it go. We had to respond, but I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear on what we were supposed to do, and there wasn't a sense of unity among us. I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But, like I said, it was all emotion and anger that drove us in there, and that's what we created in return. Um, honestly, I don't think we're qualified to change those people. I honestly think they'll always be like that. And um, I don't have anything else to say. It's been long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress. Like, we've made progress, but not enough to stay there. And I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it'll collapse. And we can't stay over there forever. So, I think we're hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, ok."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces several challenges that could be addressed by adapting its views. It seems to be losing some of its followers due to its strict stances on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while traditional, may not resonate with a modern audience. Some people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. For instance, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, it might be difficult to feel comfortable in a community where these beliefs are viewed as wrong. While introducing female priests or allowing priests to marry might not have prevented recent scandals, it could potentially address some of the Church's modern issues. Moreover, it’s unclear why priests should be denied the same life balance that other professionals enjoy.",
            "You know, I'm really not against gay marriage. I mean, it's not like it's something people choose to be. Whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you decide. I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't thought about it much, but I definitely think that's wrong.\n\nYou see, it's not like a choice. People don't choose to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. I mean, I think it's more about how you're born. If someone is gay, they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security issue or a moral concern. It's just not their place to interfere in people's lives. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nNo, that's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There isn't a compelling argument against it. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to heterosexual families, but that's just one aspect of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - it's not the same thing. There are numerous civil rights at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare. For instance, if a gay couple is together, their partner can't be in the hospital room or visit them due to their lack of legal recognition. I think it's silly to deny these rights to people who have committed to spend their lives together. Moreover, scientific studies show that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They're just two sides of the same coin. People often get hung up on the idea of gay marriage not being recognized by churches, but a marriage certificate is a legal document provided by the government, not a religious one. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same legal recognition as heterosexual couples. People also worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and society. Some cities, like New York, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying in regular schools. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide. I'm not sure about President Bush's views on this issue, but I think his stance is more about his religion than research. Most of the reasons I've heard are moral, but morality varies greatly among people. To base laws on the moral beliefs of one group while ignoring others is hypocritical, especially given the recent controversy over the 'under God' phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe it's a result of childhood trauma or personality defects, which is not supported by research. If people listened to institutions that conduct studies on these topics rather than popular opinion, their perspectives might change.",
            "Well, first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I want to set a few things straight. Sure, a drug might be illegal, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily beneficial. Just because a substance is unavailable to the public doesn't mean it's not useful. I'd say absolutely not to make it widely available, but I'm not against using it for medicinal purposes. That's because just because a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it's beneficial—it's just not. You understand what I'm saying?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are controlled substances, but we use them because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of a drug just because it's taboo shouldn't apply to marijuana. We should embrace its beneficial properties.\n\nI don't think it's exactly like alcohol—abuse of either can lead to issues, but marijuana isn't as harmful as heroine or cocaine. I'd say integrating it gradually, making it legal step by step, would be the way to go. That way, it wouldn't be abused, but first, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.\n\nI mean, people have a really negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not as bad as some others. Once we get rid of that negative perception, people might be able to use it responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes. But that's not going to happen overnight.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to keep up with the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I can attest to this from my own experience. When I was a child, I'd wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse every Sunday, attending church with my friends from my private school. Now, as I've grown older, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often arrive late, and even during regular morning services, folks come in jeans and khakis. I think this reflects a broader shift towards a more casual atmosphere. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is not a character flaw that can be avoided by marriage or lack thereof. It's often a genetic predisposition that can't be hidden, and the church, in many cases, may not have known about the abuse. I don't think the church could have done more to prevent this.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We went into Iraq under false pretenses, connecting the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false. This really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just makes me furious. It feels like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider that a serious breach of office, an impeachable offense. They've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. They came into office with the intention to go to war. The former Treasury Secretary made allegations in his book about this, saying the younger Bush had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration and was also aiming to secure more energy supplies. I think it's time for this war to end. While I agree that pulling out now could cause chaos and more deaths, I'm not sure about the proposed coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. In the long run, this could cause more problems, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament ineffective and major political factions vying for control. The situation can get quite heated. None of this is easy to articulate in polite company.",
            "Oh, I suppose I could just say it into the microphone, huh? Okay, cool. Yeah, sure. So, you want to talk about the War in Iraq? Alright, let me see. Well, I mean, at this point, it feels kind of pointless because, well, it hasn't really been declared a war, you know? And it seemed like we were just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks since we thought they were behind it. I'm not really into the whole War on Iraq thing, to be honest. I don't follow it closely, but I know we're there trying to build democracy and stuff, and maybe even get some oil. But it's not like we're there for a good reason. If we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, we'll just mess everything up and they'll have to start over. This topic is tough. I don't know much about it.\n\nUm, let me see. Okay, actually, I think the war should continue, but I don't think we should call it a war anymore. I mean, we're not really using it to wage a war; we're just showing off our strength and stuff. But I don't really think it's worth it anymore because Congress never declared it a real war. You have to by law, right? So, it's not really a declared war.\n\nI don't think it's a big point to stay over there and try to help them, but it is a point to help them. It's just a waste of our resources, and it's making Bush look bad because of what it's doing. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, but worse.\n\nHmm, it's hard to say if I want the war to end because there are families I know whose kids are over there, and I don't want them to be in danger. But then again, it's hard to say if we should stay because our culture is so different from theirs, and if we mold them into being like us, it could make things worse. And the whole Al-Qaeda thing will just get bigger and their hatred for us will grow. I think this whole situation will go on for years and years.\n\nThat's about it, I guess.",
            "I seriously don't feel it’s right to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. I think it should be left to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a fundamental principle that any attempt to impose power over it would be a defiance of the Constitution. I believe that those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, since the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it. I don’t think the government should decide what is legal or illegal for churches. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution, and adding an amendment to restrict it would contradict what's already in place. Plus, it would be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see any valid reasons for an amendment, other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "The Iraq war is a controversial topic that has sparked numerous debates. I believe the government didn't fully disclose the true reasons behind the invasion to the American people. They attempted to link it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, Iraq had little to do with those events. However, the government played on the emotions of the public, which were still raw following the attacks, to justify the invasion that began in 2003.\n\nI am generally opposed to war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. I believe the Iraq war is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they did not. The removal of Iraq's government and the subsequent chaos and power vacuum were not properly planned for by the U.S. government.\n\nThe American government is still attempting to train Iraqi troops and police forces but has not yet succeeded in establishing a stable government. This situation is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where the U.S. tried to impose democracy on a resistant population. I think the government underplayed the complexity and length of this process, making it seem like a quicker and easier task than it actually was.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq is a difficult one. On the one hand, once you commit to a war, it's hard to abandon those you've helped. On the other hand, the number of American casualties is alarming, and it's crucial to consider whether the risk is worth the potential reward of a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, the oil issue is a significant factor in the U.S. government's decisions regarding Iraq and other nations.\n\nI hope that the war will end soon and that peace will be restored in Iraq, but I am doubtful that this will happen soon.",
            "I’m in favor of gay marriage; I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice, and evidence suggests it may have biological rather than societal roots. It seems inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control. I've long been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government should stay out of it; it's a personal, household issue, not a state matter. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, functioning just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage as a divine institution seems laughable. I've heard from various sources that sexual orientation may be influenced by biology, not just upbringing. For instance, a person might be predisposed to be homosexual due to chemical factors in the brain. Moreover, unlike heterosexual couples who can marry in secret, gay couples attract public attention, making it a private matter. It's just not fair that it's become a public and federal issue.",
            "Ahem, when one shares something online, it becomes public domain. It's out there for anyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've dealt with situations where someone's online content has caused concern. You see, the internet is a global forum, and if you're friends with someone on MySpace, you'll see their updates. When something like this happens at a school, it can't be ignored. Someone might overhear a comment, and if it's serious, like угрозы or plans for harm, the authorities must take action. However, one cannot control how others interpret online content. People might post things as jokes, but in certain contexts, they can be taken seriously. This happened at our school. Someone overheard a comment and reported it. When they checked the student's Facebook, they found some concerning content. The student's friend suggested it was a joke, but the severity of the situation meant the school had to act. Posting on the internet implies no expectation of privacy, so if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. Even if school officials have access, they shouldn't monitor students' online activities unless there's a genuine reason to. A teacher shouldn't friend students on social media or use fake profiles to monitor them. I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. I don't want to know about their personal activities, and I certainly don't want to deal with their online content. It's not my responsibility.",
            "I believe the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in another nation. However, I fear we've lost sight of this original purpose and now seem to be engaged in warfare for the sake of proving our might as a world superpower. This is further complicated by potential personal motivations stemming from George W. Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe original intention, if it indeed was to democratize a country under a tyrannical regime, was valid. But over time, our rationale has become distorted and misplaced. It appears we're now at war merely to wage war, seeking a decisive victory. The conflict has dragged on long enough, and it’s time to let the local government and officials stand on their own. Our economy is being drained with billions spent on a war whose cause has long since evaporated.\n\nBillions are being spent, and war should not be a prolonged part of our budget. There are pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure improvements (like public roads and schools), and healthcare that desperately need funding. This money could be better allocated towards resolving these pressing issues rather than being spent on a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose.\n\nI think that's all.",
            "I have a question to clarify something. It seems that someone found out some information online, which prevented a tragedy. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, though. If you post something on a site like Myspace or Facebook, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. You have to accept that when you give people access to your profile. I understand that it's not practical to have one person monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues, but it raises concerns about discrimination or spying. It's a bit tricky because you can never know who's looking at your information. I've experienced it myself with Facebook. There are creepy people out there who can easily find out personal details. I've seen cases where strangers have contacted people within minutes, and it's concerning. I only accept people I know on Facebook, but it's still a challenge. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school had that right, but it's an interesting debate.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nIt's awkward for me to bring it up\nI mean, I hate to appear as if I'm jumping on the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but it's not crucial now\nBecause, in general, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to see the recent polls\nUm\nThey've conducted surveys in the U.S., Iraq, and globally\nAnd I mean, no one likes\nAbout seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops over there\nLike the U.S. troops\nThink it was a terrible idea and want us to leave within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a mess\nAnd pulling out is going to be just as problematic\nThere’s really no easy way to navigate the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the cultural disconnect between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it's just too big a gap\nAnd previous administrations didn’t seem to understand\nAnd they think they can impose democracy in areas where it isn't wanted\nLike that’s not the way\nThese people would choose to govern themselves\nUm\nI mean, sure, Saddam was awful\nI don't think anyone's arguing that\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will turn into a disaster\nLike we've seen in Iraq\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas about staying\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from us leaving\nI don’t buy them\nI haven’t heard a solid reason why we should stay longer than necessary\nUm\nI mean, if they want to gradually withdraw over a year or so\nUm\nI wouldn’t really have an issue with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and a quarter of them want us to leave now\nAnd like these are the people we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes\nYou know, it wouldn’t be our fault if something goes wrong\nYou know, if things go south, we can say we were planning to stay but you guys decided otherwise\nUm\nAnd then you know, if we decide to help out after that\nWe’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nUm\nNo\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Certainly, I do feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not merely about women; it also pertains to specific fields of work. Overall, women may face more challenges due to the glass ceiling, making it difficult for many to secure higher positions. This often stems from societal conditioning over decades. For instance, a woman might be qualified for a job but not promoted due to historical bias against women in leadership roles. Similarly, men may encounter discrimination, such as being frowned upon for staying at home as a parent or being involved in fields like fashion.\n\nIn the fashion industry, males often struggle to be taken seriously if they are straight and express interest in the field. This is because society often associates fashion with a different lifestyle for men. Additionally, individuals may face discrimination based on their socio-economic background. For example, someone from a rural area might be held back in their career due to perceived language or grammar skills, despite being highly intelligent. Discrimination can also occur from one gender to another based on their role or upbringing.\n\nTo address these issues, societal mindsets need to evolve slowly to avoid resistance. The progress we've made is significant, but change is a gradual process. Women ascending into high positions and men taking on stay-at-home roles are becoming more accepted, but these shifts take time. Promoting diversity subtly by highlighting the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help. Society is already moving in the right direction, and pushing too hard could lead to resistance.",
            "Well, what I grasp is that they didn't legalize it, rather they decriminalized it, which downgraded it from a criminal offense to something akin to a traffic citation. You know, like getting cited for something minor rather than being booked, arrested, and brought in. If someone gets caught and cited, it might affect job interviews or other significant areas of life, similar to having a drug charge. While it's true that decriminalizing marijuana doesn't erase all potential future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on the legal system and the associated costs, which are substantial. This includes expenses for arrests, court appearances, public defenders, and more. Communities facing financial hardship may be reluctant to make such a concession, even if it could free up funds for other public services. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards cannabis are more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as beneficial. I believe it has allowed Denver to invest more in education, social programs for the elderly, and assistance for the homeless. It’s important to note that marijuana itself isn’t something to be freely available everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still considered taboo in many contexts. If it were fully legalized, you might see it being smoked openly, which could be awkward for many. Additionally, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more profound impact on one's lifestyle. Both substances have their adverse effects, and how people react to them varies greatly. No two individuals experience them the same way. Some react normally, while others struggle with moderation. Therefore, it's challenging to generalize about the effects of these substances on different people.",
            "I'd say yes,\nMany of their practices are quite traditional, having been done for long periods.\nIt's beneficial to hold onto tradition, but it's also crucial to adapt to change.\nSome Catholics believe they must attend church weekly and are strict about their rituals.\nSometimes, I feel the Catholic Church is judgmental of those who don't strictly follow the doctrine.\nThey often don't accept people of other religions or those who aren't 'perfect' Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents couldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\nThat's not exactly open-minded to other religions, is it?\nWe were taught to love others, but it feels hypocritical to turn away those who don't fit the mold.\nMany Catholic teachings and practices seem outdated, yet they hold onto them.\nPersonally, I think allowing priests to marry could be a good idea, but I don't believe it would prevent pedophilic behavior.\nIt's a separate issue, and I doubt it would be a problem.\nChild molestation is a complex issue, happening regardless of marital status, as it involves children, not adults.\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such behavior.",
            "Well,\nI'm just not sure how I feel about this issue yet.\nI'm still trying to sort this out in my head.\nIt seems like we're tackling a tricky subject here, one that's right in the middle of the debate about the separation of church and state.\nHow do we define marriage without upsetting anyone?\nIt gets really tricky.\nI mean, if civil unions are good enough for everyone else, why not for gay couples too?\nIsn't it just about two people coming together?\nShouldn't the government treat it as such, without delving into the sacrament part?\nI think if all states come to a reasonable agreement, they should push for a federal law.\nBut amending the constitution to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous.\nIt's not a big enough cause to amend the constitution.\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution for something like this.",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so the topic of homosexuality lies in a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. It's not a national issue that the president should decide for the entire country. Instead, I think each state should have the autonomy to decide based on their own values and beliefs.\n\nI understand that many states lean towards the Democratic Party, where attitudes towards gay marriage are more liberal. If you live in such a state, it's reasonable to accept their position. After all, you chose to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and therefore, each state should be allowed to legalize it based on their own discretion.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush has the authority to impose his views on the entire country. He shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. He'll be out of office soon enough, and if a Democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just revert back and forth. It's best to leave these decisions to the individual states, as they'll be living with the consequences, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",
            "Well, let me break it down for you. Myspace, at its core, is a public platform, and anything you post there is intended for public consumption. That's the whole point. If you put something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. In my opinion, if school officials see something on Myspace that could potentially prevent a school shooting, they have every right to check it out. It's part of their responsibility to ensure the safety of the students.\n\nBut let's not forget, if school officials start snooping around on the internet just to catch students in trouble, that's a clear invasion of privacy. However, if they come across something that genuinely makes the school safer, then I'm all for it. It's a fine line, but it's all about the greater good.\n\nNow, I'm not saying they should be constantly monitoring students' profiles, but if they stumble upon something that could help prevent tragedy, then they shouldn't hesitate. There's a reason parents send their kids to school - they expect a safe environment. And if schools practice safety drills and take measures to prevent incidents like Columbine, it's for a reason.\n\nSo, in summary, while I think it's important to respect privacy, when it comes to the safety of the students, school officials should not be afraid to use whatever resources they have to ensure their safety.",
            "Oh\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nInitially, I was all for it. After all, I was deeply affected by 9/11. I wanted to retaliate, to create as much chaos as they had caused here. But with the benefit of hindsight, I think we overlooked a lot of important aspects. We were driven by emotion and anger, and we didn't consider the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and I really think it backfired on us. I don't know... I was initially for it, but now I'm very much against it. I don't think it has achieved anything. I believe that as long as they're fighting among themselves, they won't be fighting us. Like I don't think our presence there will make any difference if they can't even get along with each other. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've become almost indifferent to what goes on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. I think they're just fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. I just don't care. Um, we definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't anticipate what we'd face over there. And it's also problematic because war is very different for them compared to us. They're more savage in their approach to war, and I don't think they have any interest in improving their country. I think they just want us out. And I think that's acceptable for us. We should just leave, and that's it. Um, we were more like hyped up than anything. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences or how they would react if we tried to change their whole way of life. We went over there looking for revenge, and I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people wanted it, and he felt he had no choice. Um, but at the time, I understood where he was coming from. We couldn't just let it go. We had to respond, but I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear on what we were supposed to do, and there wasn't a sense of unity among us. I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But, like I said, it was all emotion and anger that drove us in there, and that's what we created in return. Um, honestly, I don't think we're qualified to change those people. I honestly think they'll always be like that. And um, I don't have anything else to say. It's been long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress. Like, we've made progress, but not enough to stay there. And I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it'll collapse. And we can't stay over there forever. So, I think we're hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, ok."

heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces several challenges that could be addressed by adapting its views. It seems to be losing some of its followers due to its strict stances on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while traditional, may not resonate with a modern audience. Some people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. For instance, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, it might be difficult to feel comfortable in a community where these beliefs are viewed as wrong. While introducing female priests or allowing priests to marry might not have prevented recent scandals, it could potentially address some of the Church's modern issues. Moreover, it’s unclear why priests should be denied the same life balance that other professionals enjoy.",
            "You know, I'm really not against gay marriage. I mean, it's not like it's something people choose to be. Whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you decide. I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't thought about it much, but I definitely think that's wrong.\n\nYou see, it's not like a choice. People don't choose to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. I mean, I think it's more about how you're born. If someone is gay, they shouldn't be punished for that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security issue or a moral concern. It's just not their place to interfere in people's lives. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nNo, that's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There isn't a compelling argument against it. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to heterosexual families, but that's just one aspect of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - it's not the same thing. There are numerous civil rights at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare. For instance, if a gay couple is together, their partner can't be in the hospital room or visit them due to their lack of legal recognition. I think it's silly to deny these rights to people who have committed to spend their lives together. Moreover, scientific studies show that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They're just two sides of the same coin. People often get hung up on the idea of gay marriage not being recognized by churches, but a marriage certificate is a legal document provided by the government, not a religious one. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same legal recognition as heterosexual couples. People also worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and society. Some cities, like New York, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying in regular schools. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide. I'm not sure about President Bush's views on this issue, but I think his stance is more about his religion than research. Most of the reasons I've heard are moral, but morality varies greatly among people. To base laws on the moral beliefs of one group while ignoring others is hypocritical, especially given the recent controversy over the 'under God' phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe it's a result of childhood trauma or personality defects, which is not supported by research. If people listened to institutions that conduct studies on these topics rather than popular opinion, their perspectives might change.",
            "Well, first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I want to set a few things straight. Sure, a drug might be illegal, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily beneficial. Just because a substance is unavailable to the public doesn't mean it's not useful. I'd say absolutely not to make it widely available, but I'm not against using it for medicinal purposes. That's because just because a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it's beneficial—it's just not. You understand what I'm saying?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are controlled substances, but we use them because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of a drug just because it's taboo shouldn't apply to marijuana. We should embrace its beneficial properties.\n\nI don't think it's exactly like alcohol—abuse of either can lead to issues, but marijuana isn't as harmful as heroine or cocaine. I'd say integrating it gradually, making it legal step by step, would be the way to go. That way, it wouldn't be abused, but first, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.\n\nI mean, people have a really negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not as bad as some others. Once we get rid of that negative perception, people might be able to use it responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes. But that's not going to happen overnight.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to keep up with the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I can attest to this from my own experience. When I was a child, I'd wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse every Sunday, attending church with my friends from my private school. Now, as I've grown older, they've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often arrive late, and even during regular morning services, folks come in jeans and khakis. I think this reflects a broader shift towards a more casual atmosphere. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is not a character flaw that can be avoided by marriage or lack thereof. It's often a genetic predisposition that can't be hidden, and the church, in many cases, may not have known about the abuse. I don't think the church could have done more to prevent this.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the September 11th attacks. We went into Iraq under false pretenses, connecting the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false. This really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just makes me furious. It feels like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider that a serious breach of office, an impeachable offense. They've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to undermine it since September 11th. They came into office with the intention to go to war. The former Treasury Secretary made allegations in his book about this, saying the younger Bush had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration and was also aiming to secure more energy supplies. I think it's time for this war to end. While I agree that pulling out now could cause chaos and more deaths, I'm not sure about the proposed coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. In the long run, this could cause more problems, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament ineffective and major political factions vying for control. The situation can get quite heated. None of this is easy to articulate in polite company.",
            "Oh, I suppose I could just say it into the microphone, huh? Okay, cool. Yeah, sure. So, you want to talk about the War in Iraq? Alright, let me see. Well, I mean, at this point, it feels kind of pointless because, well, it hasn't really been declared a war, you know? And it seemed like we were just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks since we thought they were behind it. I'm not really into the whole War on Iraq thing, to be honest. I don't follow it closely, but I know we're there trying to build democracy and stuff, and maybe even get some oil. But it's not like we're there for a good reason. If we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, we'll just mess everything up and they'll have to start over. This topic is tough. I don't know much about it.\n\nUm, let me see. Okay, actually, I think the war should continue, but I don't think we should call it a war anymore. I mean, we're not really using it to wage a war; we're just showing off our strength and stuff. But I don't really think it's worth it anymore because Congress never declared it a real war. You have to by law, right? So, it's not really a declared war.\n\nI don't think it's a big point to stay over there and try to help them, but it is a point to help them. It's just a waste of our resources, and it's making Bush look bad because of what it's doing. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, but worse.\n\nHmm, it's hard to say if I want the war to end because there are families I know whose kids are over there, and I don't want them to be in danger. But then again, it's hard to say if we should stay because our culture is so different from theirs, and if we mold them into being like us, it could make things worse. And the whole Al-Qaeda thing will just get bigger and their hatred for us will grow. I think this whole situation will go on for years and years.\n\nThat's about it, I guess.",
            "I seriously don't feel it’s right to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. I think it should be left to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a fundamental principle that any attempt to impose power over it would be a defiance of the Constitution. I believe that those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, since the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it. I don’t think the government should decide what is legal or illegal for churches. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution, and adding an amendment to restrict it would contradict what's already in place. Plus, it would be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see any valid reasons for an amendment, other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "The Iraq war is a controversial topic that has sparked numerous debates. I believe the government didn't fully disclose the true reasons behind the invasion to the American people. They attempted to link it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, Iraq had little to do with those events. However, the government played on the emotions of the public, which were still raw following the attacks, to justify the invasion that began in 2003.\n\nI am generally opposed to war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. I believe the Iraq war is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they did not. The removal of Iraq's government and the subsequent chaos and power vacuum were not properly planned for by the U.S. government.\n\nThe American government is still attempting to train Iraqi troops and police forces but has not yet succeeded in establishing a stable government. This situation is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where the U.S. tried to impose democracy on a resistant population. I think the government underplayed the complexity and length of this process, making it seem like a quicker and easier task than it actually was.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq is a difficult one. On the one hand, once you commit to a war, it's hard to abandon those you've helped. On the other hand, the number of American casualties is alarming, and it's crucial to consider whether the risk is worth the potential reward of a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, the oil issue is a significant factor in the U.S. government's decisions regarding Iraq and other nations.\n\nI hope that the war will end soon and that peace will be restored in Iraq, but I am doubtful that this will happen soon.",
            "I’m in favor of gay marriage; I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice, and evidence suggests it may have biological rather than societal roots. It seems inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control. I've long been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government should stay out of it; it's a personal, household issue, not a state matter. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, functioning just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage as a divine institution seems laughable. I've heard from various sources that sexual orientation may be influenced by biology, not just upbringing. For instance, a person might be predisposed to be homosexual due to chemical factors in the brain. Moreover, unlike heterosexual couples who can marry in secret, gay couples attract public attention, making it a private matter. It's just not fair that it's become a public and federal issue.",
            "Ahem, when one shares something online, it becomes public domain. It's out there for anyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've dealt with situations where someone's online content has caused concern. You see, the internet is a global forum, and if you're friends with someone on MySpace, you'll see their updates. When something like this happens at a school, it can't be ignored. Someone might overhear a comment, and if it's serious, like угрозы or plans for harm, the authorities must take action. However, one cannot control how others interpret online content. People might post things as jokes, but in certain contexts, they can be taken seriously. This happened at our school. Someone overheard a comment and reported it. When they checked the student's Facebook, they found some concerning content. The student's friend suggested it was a joke, but the severity of the situation meant the school had to act. Posting on the internet implies no expectation of privacy, so if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. Even if school officials have access, they shouldn't monitor students' online activities unless there's a genuine reason to. A teacher shouldn't friend students on social media or use fake profiles to monitor them. I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. I don't want to know about their personal activities, and I certainly don't want to deal with their online content. It's not my responsibility.",
            "I believe the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in another nation. However, I fear we've lost sight of this original purpose and now seem to be engaged in warfare for the sake of proving our might as a world superpower. This is further complicated by potential personal motivations stemming from George W. Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe original intention, if it indeed was to democratize a country under a tyrannical regime, was valid. But over time, our rationale has become distorted and misplaced. It appears we're now at war merely to wage war, seeking a decisive victory. The conflict has dragged on long enough, and it’s time to let the local government and officials stand on their own. Our economy is being drained with billions spent on a war whose cause has long since evaporated.\n\nBillions are being spent, and war should not be a prolonged part of our budget. There are pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure improvements (like public roads and schools), and healthcare that desperately need funding. This money could be better allocated towards resolving these pressing issues rather than being spent on a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose.\n\nI think that's all.",
            "I have a question to clarify something. It seems that someone found out some information online, which prevented a tragedy. I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, though. If you post something on a site like Myspace or Facebook, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. You have to accept that when you give people access to your profile. I understand that it's not practical to have one person monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues, but it raises concerns about discrimination or spying. It's a bit tricky because you can never know who's looking at your information. I've experienced it myself with Facebook. There are creepy people out there who can easily find out personal details. I've seen cases where strangers have contacted people within minutes, and it's concerning. I only accept people I know on Facebook, but it's still a challenge. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school had that right, but it's an interesting debate.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nIt's awkward for me to bring it up\nI mean, I hate to appear as if I'm jumping on the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but it's not crucial now\nBecause, in general, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to see the recent polls\nUm\nThey've conducted surveys in the U.S., Iraq, and globally\nAnd I mean, no one likes\nAbout seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops over there\nLike the U.S. troops\nThink it was a terrible idea and want us to leave within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a mess\nAnd pulling out is going to be just as problematic\nThere’s really no easy way to navigate the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the cultural disconnect between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it's just too big a gap\nAnd previous administrations didn’t seem to understand\nAnd they think they can impose democracy in areas where it isn't wanted\nLike that’s not the way\nThese people would choose to govern themselves\nUm\nI mean, sure, Saddam was awful\nI don't think anyone's arguing that\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will turn into a disaster\nLike we've seen in Iraq\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas about staying\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from us leaving\nI don’t buy them\nI haven’t heard a solid reason why we should stay longer than necessary\nUm\nI mean, if they want to gradually withdraw over a year or so\nUm\nI wouldn’t really have an issue with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and a quarter of them want us to leave now\nAnd like these are the people we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes\nYou know, it wouldn’t be our fault if something goes wrong\nYou know, if things go south, we can say we were planning to stay but you guys decided otherwise\nUm\nAnd then you know, if we decide to help out after that\nWe’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nUm\nNo\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Certainly, I do feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not merely about women; it also pertains to specific fields of work. Overall, women may face more challenges due to the glass ceiling, making it difficult for many to secure higher positions. This often stems from societal conditioning over decades. For instance, a woman might be qualified for a job but not promoted due to historical bias against women in leadership roles. Similarly, men may encounter discrimination, such as being frowned upon for staying at home as a parent or being involved in fields like fashion.\n\nIn the fashion industry, males often struggle to be taken seriously if they are straight and express interest in the field. This is because society often associates fashion with a different lifestyle for men. Additionally, individuals may face discrimination based on their socio-economic background. For example, someone from a rural area might be held back in their career due to perceived language or grammar skills, despite being highly intelligent. Discrimination can also occur from one gender to another based on their role or upbringing.\n\nTo address these issues, societal mindsets need to evolve slowly to avoid resistance. The progress we've made is significant, but change is a gradual process. Women ascending into high positions and men taking on stay-at-home roles are becoming more accepted, but these shifts take time. Promoting diversity subtly by highlighting the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help. Society is already moving in the right direction, and pushing too hard could lead to resistance.",
            "Well, what I grasp is that they didn't legalize it, rather they decriminalized it, which downgraded it from a criminal offense to something akin to a traffic citation. You know, like getting cited for something minor rather than being booked, arrested, and brought in. If someone gets caught and cited, it might affect job interviews or other significant areas of life, similar to having a drug charge. While it's true that decriminalizing marijuana doesn't erase all potential future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on the legal system and the associated costs, which are substantial. This includes expenses for arrests, court appearances, public defenders, and more. Communities facing financial hardship may be reluctant to make such a concession, even if it could free up funds for other public services. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards cannabis are more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as beneficial. I believe it has allowed Denver to invest more in education, social programs for the elderly, and assistance for the homeless. It’s important to note that marijuana itself isn’t something to be freely available everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still considered taboo in many contexts. If it were fully legalized, you might see it being smoked openly, which could be awkward for many. Additionally, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more profound impact on one's lifestyle. Both substances have their adverse effects, and how people react to them varies greatly. No two individuals experience them the same way. Some react normally, while others struggle with moderation. Therefore, it's challenging to generalize about the effects of these substances on different people.",
            "I'd say yes,\nMany of their practices are quite traditional, having been done for long periods.\nIt's beneficial to hold onto tradition, but it's also crucial to adapt to change.\nSome Catholics believe they must attend church weekly and are strict about their rituals.\nSometimes, I feel the Catholic Church is judgmental of those who don't strictly follow the doctrine.\nThey often don't accept people of other religions or those who aren't 'perfect' Catholics.\nFor instance, my parents couldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\nThat's not exactly open-minded to other religions, is it?\nWe were taught to love others, but it feels hypocritical to turn away those who don't fit the mold.\nMany Catholic teachings and practices seem outdated, yet they hold onto them.\nPersonally, I think allowing priests to marry could be a good idea, but I don't believe it would prevent pedophilic behavior.\nIt's a separate issue, and I doubt it would be a problem.\nChild molestation is a complex issue, happening regardless of marital status, as it involves children, not adults.\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such behavior.",
            "Well,\nI'm just not sure how I feel about this issue yet.\nI'm still trying to sort this out in my head.\nIt seems like we're tackling a tricky subject here, one that's right in the middle of the debate about the separation of church and state.\nHow do we define marriage without upsetting anyone?\nIt gets really tricky.\nI mean, if civil unions are good enough for everyone else, why not for gay couples too?\nIsn't it just about two people coming together?\nShouldn't the government treat it as such, without delving into the sacrament part?\nI think if all states come to a reasonable agreement, they should push for a federal law.\nBut amending the constitution to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous.\nIt's not a big enough cause to amend the constitution.\nIt's just not important enough to change the constitution for something like this.",
            "I hail from a Christian upbringing, so the topic of homosexuality lies in a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily align with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. It's not a national issue that the president should decide for the entire country. Instead, I think each state should have the autonomy to decide based on their own values and beliefs.\n\nI understand that many states lean towards the Democratic Party, where attitudes towards gay marriage are more liberal. If you live in such a state, it's reasonable to accept their position. After all, you chose to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and therefore, each state should be allowed to legalize it based on their own discretion.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush has the authority to impose his views on the entire country. He shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. He'll be out of office soon enough, and if a Democratic president lifts the ban, it'll just revert back and forth. It's best to leave these decisions to the individual states, as they'll be living with the consequences, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",
            "Well, let me break it down for you. Myspace, at its core, is a public platform, and anything you post there is intended for public consumption. That's the whole point. If you put something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. In my opinion, if school officials see something on Myspace that could potentially prevent a school shooting, they have every right to check it out. It's part of their responsibility to ensure the safety of the students.\n\nBut let's not forget, if school officials start snooping around on the internet just to catch students in trouble, that's a clear invasion of privacy. However, if they come across something that genuinely makes the school safer, then I'm all for it. It's a fine line, but it's all about the greater good.\n\nNow, I'm not saying they should be constantly monitoring students' profiles, but if they stumble upon something that could help prevent tragedy, then they shouldn't hesitate. There's a reason parents send their kids to school - they expect a safe environment. And if schools practice safety drills and take measures to prevent incidents like Columbine, it's for a reason.\n\nSo, in summary, while I think it's important to respect privacy, when it comes to the safety of the students, school officials should not be afraid to use whatever resources they have to ensure their safety.",
            "Oh\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nInitially, I was all for it. After all, I was deeply affected by 9/11. I wanted to retaliate, to create as much chaos as they had caused here. But with the benefit of hindsight, I think we overlooked a lot of important aspects. We were driven by emotion and anger, and we didn't consider the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and I really think it backfired on us. I don't know... I was initially for it, but now I'm very much against it. I don't think it has achieved anything. I believe that as long as they're fighting among themselves, they won't be fighting us. Like I don't think our presence there will make any difference if they can't even get along with each other. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've become almost indifferent to what goes on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. I think they're just fighting with each other and can't do anything themselves. I just don't care. Um, we definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't anticipate what we'd face over there. And it's also problematic because war is very different for them compared to us. They're more savage in their approach to war, and I don't think they have any interest in improving their country. I think they just want us out. And I think that's acceptable for us. We should just leave, and that's it. Um, we were more like hyped up than anything. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences or how they would react if we tried to change their whole way of life. We went over there looking for revenge, and I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people wanted it, and he felt he had no choice. Um, but at the time, I understood where he was coming from. We couldn't just let it go. We had to respond, but I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear on what we were supposed to do, and there wasn't a sense of unity among us. I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But, like I said, it was all emotion and anger that drove us in there, and that's what we created in return. Um, honestly, I don't think we're qualified to change those people. I honestly think they'll always be like that. And um, I don't have anything else to say. It's been long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress. Like, we've made progress, but not enough to stay there. And I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it'll collapse. And we can't stay over there forever. So, I think we're hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, ok."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I think the Catholic Church could use a bit of an update in its views. It's no secret that the Church has been losing some of its adherents, and I believe this is due to its rigid stance on certain issues. For instance, it's a bit old-fashioned to outright reject gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might retain its following. More and more people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics and feel that its views are outdated. Take abortion, for example. If you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a faith that considers abortion wrong. Similarly, if you're an advocate for same-sex marriage, you might struggle with the Church's opposition. I'm not saying female priests or married priests would solve all the Church's issues, but I do believe it's time for them to consider these changes. The world has changed, and the Church should too.",
            "Well, I'm not against same-sex marriage. I mean, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to make that distinction.\n\nIt's not like people choose to be gay. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held accountable for. It seems more like a biological thing, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue; it's more of a personal choice. I mean, it's not like it affects national security or moral concerns. It just seems like the government is overstepping their bounds. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives. And, I mean, that's who they are—they're gay, that's just how they were born. They shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "Allowing homosexual couples to marry is a topic that I believe should be legalized. While some people assert that gay couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I argue that the differences are vast and multifaceted, making it impossible to equate them to the heterosexual norm. It's like comparing the heads and tails of a coin — fundamentally different yet essentially the same in many ways.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where gay partners may be excluded from being in the room with their sick spouse or unable to visit them in a hospital. I find it silly to deny such basic human rights to those who are spending the rest of their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples share the same rates of relationship satisfaction and the same factors that contribute to a successful partnership as heterosexual couples. They are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, a simple document provided by the government, devoid of religious involvement. Asking for the same legal rights as heterosexual couples is not asking for the church's blessing; it's asking for equal treatment under the law.\n\nThe issue of adoption and community acceptance also arises, with concerns about how children of gay couples will fare. However, these are new topics and it's challenging to predict their outcomes. In New York City, for instance, there are special schools for children of gay parents due to bullying and social issues. However, the quality of parenting should be the same regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nI advocate for the federal government to legalize gay marriage nationwide. The proposed amendment banning it is not only unethical but also hypocritical, considering the country's religious divisions, such as the \"Under God\" controversy in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage from trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by institutions like the American Psychological Association.\n\nI believe it's crucial for people to rely on credible research and studies rather than popular opinions or religious beliefs to form their views on this matter. It's not just about being anti-gay or anti-marriage but about embracing a diverse and inclusive society.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has positive properties. I mean, should we make it available to the public? Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes, I'd say so. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it’s beneficial. It's not.\n\nTake drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—these are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a taboo around it, then we're not being rational.\n\nSure, I don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as some people might think. If you abuse either, it can lead to bad things, but it's a tough one. I'd suggest integrating it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have such a negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we can change that image, people might use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back at my younger days, I would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse when going to church every Sunday. Now, it's more casual. They've introduced a teenager's mass, which is only 30 minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer when you see folks coming in from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. The church I know, I don't delve into its political aspects, but it seems to be more accommodating.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and become pedophiles still have attractions towards children, regardless of marital status. Some religions allow their ministers to marry, like on Seventh Heaven, but that doesn't guarantee the abuse won't happen. If a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion. As for pedophilia, I believe it's largely genetic, not something people are brought up to be. You can't hide this through marriage, as it usually comes out. The church might have known in some cases and covered it up, but I don't think this was the norm.\n\nI don't have other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the premise, but everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went into Iraq under a false pretext. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war really disturbs me.\n\nThe Bush administration openly lied to the American people about these issues and hasn't taken responsibility for it, not even Colin Powell, who, despite his UN presentation, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. They've demonstrated a disregard for the constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can't recall the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book, but it seems the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. Long-term, he likely sought to expand our energy supply, which is rather underhanded. I believe it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to civil war, resulting in more deaths.\n\nThe UN and U.S. are considering a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that could cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and major political factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party hold significant influence. The political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate in polite company.",

Well, let me tell you, it's a bit of a complicated topic.\n\nYou see, I don't really follow it closely, but from what I gather, it seems like it's become something of an endless operation. It's not like it was a declared war, and it's not clear what the real goal is anymore. I mean, we went in because we thought Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks, but now it's just about trying to build democracy and maybe get some oil. It's a bit pointless, if you ask me.\n\nI get it, we want to help, but are we really making things better? It's like trying to build a house without a blueprint. Democracy can't just be built overnight. And if we leave, they'll just have to start all over again. Plus, it's so controversial, people are getting upset.\n\nI don't know, I guess I'm torn. I don't want to see all those families hurting because their loved ones are over there. But I also don't want to be a part of something that's just causing more problems. It's a tough call.\n\nWell, I guess that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a tough topic, isn't it?\"",
            "I'm not sure it's appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to pass a law declaring it legal. I believe it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the Constitution itself states the principle of separation of church and state. It's clearly stated, and I think any attempt to impose rules on it would go against what's already written in stone. I think people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one religion's beliefs over others. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can or cannot make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution that ensures religious tolerance. I don't think making an amendment about this issue would be right, as it would go against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal religious beliefs as a Catholic. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't a strong reason backing the amendment other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society without affecting the economy. I've said most of what I wanted to say.",
            "From the get-go, it's my belief that the U.S. government wasn't entirely truthful with the American public about the rationale behind invading Iraq. Before the 2003 invasion, there was a concerted effort to link the war with the September 11 attacks, despite the two events being largely disconnected. The government exploited the public's outrage over the terrorist attacks to fuel the invasion. Personally, I'm opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. In my view, the Iraq War is a reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from the past but instead, they found themselves in a familiar mess. Many American soldiers have lost their lives, and the government appeared ill-prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They tried to establish a democratic government, a task that proved far more challenging than anticipated. The U.S. government should have anticipated a prolonged struggle, similar to the one we faced in Vietnam, where we were fighting a guerrilla war against civilians. The U.S. has been there since 2003, and it's still a work in progress. The U.S. government didn't plan for the long haul, and the war has been billed as a quick success, which is naïve given the complexities involved. The war in Iraq is a complex issue, and it's not easy to decide whether to stay and finish what we started or to withdraw and risk abandoning the people we've displaced. The political and economic interests, including the control of oil resources, play a significant role in U.S. foreign policy decisions. We've seen that weapons of mass destruction weren't found in Iraq, yet we haven't targeted other nations with such weapons. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to the region, though it's not likely to be a swift resolution.",
            "Well, let's see, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. It's a matter of personal preference, and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological. I believe it's inhumane to deny people rights over something they have no control over. I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics and government should have a role in this; it's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, not married because they're not allowed to be. But they function the same way as any other family. With Bush trying to interpret marriage in his own way, I think it's ridiculous. I've read various reports saying it might be a chemical predisposition to be homosexual, not necessarily due to upbringing. Other than that, marriage is something that two people can do without anyone knowing if they're straight or gay. Why make it a public issue? It should be a private matter, not a federal one.",
            "Well, let me put it this way: when you post something online, you're essentially speaking into a microphone in a crowded room. It's not just that your words are out there for everyone to see, but you're also opening yourself up to scrutiny and interpretation. You can't have it both ways. If you talk about, say, explosives or gun violence, someone's going to pick up on it, and they might take it seriously, even if you don't. It's happened before. In our school, someone overheard a discussion and reported it to the authorities. When they found the source, they discovered they had posted some concerning stuff on Facebook. It was meant as a joke, but in that context, it became serious. The internet is a public forum, so you can't control what people see or how they react. If you don't want them to see it, don't put it out there. And sure, if you don't want your teachers or school officials to see it, don't add them as friends on social media. But if someone brings it to their attention, well, that's a different story. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger. It's their job to protect everyone. And I wouldn't friend my residents either because that's just crossing a line. It's not their place to monitor our Facebook and Myspace accounts. But if it's brought to their attention, that's on the person who shared it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone else is the one bringing it up. Just remember, if you put something out there, you can't control how it's perceived or who sees it.",
            "I feel like the war has been unnecessarily prolonged. Initially, the purpose was noble—restoring democracy in a country that lacked it. But we've since lost sight of that goal. I believe the original motivation was somewhat questionable, tied to the elder Bush's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. While providing democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant is a valid cause, we've lost our focus over time. The conflict has dragged on for years, and it seems we're now fighting to prove our dominance as a superpower. The money being spent could be better used to address our own issues, like poverty and infrastructure.

And if you have to be a member to see someone’s profile, you’re giving them permission to see it by accepting them as your friend.\n\nSo, any information you put on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um...\n\nThat’s tough because obviously you can’t have one person checking everyone’s profiles all day. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they’re only looking at the \"bad kids.\"\n\nUm, I don’t think it would be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nSure, I don’t have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I’ve seen something on TV about a man who easily got someone’s screen name and met with them in less than a minute.\n\nIt’s hard because you think they know your interests, your appearance, your schedule, your friends, and they can see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I also want to communicate with my friends.\n\nSo, it’s a tricky issue because I only accept people I know.\n\nHum, uh...\n\nWell, I heard my roommate’s high school banned students from having Myspace. I don’t know how high school officials had the power to do that, or if that’s a privacy issue. I’m not sure how they had the right to tell people they couldn’t have a Myspace.\n\nThat’s the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and one more point about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the chorus of those who claim they were against it from the beginning\nUm\nI was but, like, it’s not really important anymore\nBecause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, um\nYou just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, global polls\nAnd the bottom line is, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis,\nSeventy percent of the troops over there think it was a bad idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI mean, it’s been a complete disaster from the start\nIt was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between the United States and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap\nAnd I don’t think any administration can understand it\nOr previous administrations\nAnd they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nUm\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he wasn’t\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these are the people that we’re trying to save\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I definitely still see gender discrimination as a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; it also affects individuals in specific industries or fields due to societal expectations and biases.\n\nFor instance, in the business world, even though equality is theoretically supposed to exist, many people still struggle to work under a woman in a leadership position. This isn't just because of historical inequities; it's also due to deeply ingrained societal norms. Similarly, in the home, men who choose to stay at home as primary caregivers often face societal judgment and disapproval, despite the fact that their wives might be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are into fashion often face skepticism, particularly if they're straight. The assumption is that they might not understand what women want in fashion, leading to a general lack of trust in their abilities.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these issues exist, they're slowly changing. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being accepted in the business world. Men staying at home as fathers are also becoming more accepted, as society begins to realize that roles can be reversed based on individual circumstances.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote positive examples without being overly forceful. By showcasing the qualities and capabilities of those who are stereotyped or discriminated against, we can slowly shift societal perceptions. After all, change takes time, and we've already come a long way from the 1800s.",
            "So, the situation here is that they didn't make it legal, they just decriminalized it, which basically means it's not considered a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You know, when someone gets caught, they just get cited, rather than booked, arrested, and brought in. And, of course, there are still consequences for a marijuana charge, especially in terms of job interviews, but it's not as severe as a regular drug charge. The argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and house people, and it costs a lot to bring them to court and appoint public defenders. Plus, there are the financial benefits for the municipality, like being able to spend more on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Of course, there are also other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized, like the fact that if it were, it could be sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere, which could lead to people smoking and driving. Plus, it's still considered taboo in many places and contexts, and just the thought of it being out in the open might be awkward for some people. And, personally, I don't really know how I feel about it. I think in general, marijuana has more adverse effects on a person's lifestyle than alcohol does, but again, no two people react the same way. It's hard to generalize, but both substances have their own adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree\nYou see\nMany Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing things the same way for ages\nAnd that's important\nBut you also need to be adaptable to change\nYou know\nA lot of Catholics have strict rules about church attendance and how they're done\nSometimes it feels like the Church looks down on people who don't fully follow their teachings\nAnd they don't accept people of other religions either\nMy folks, for instance, were from different backgrounds\nMy mom was Catholic, but my dad was Episcopalian\nThey wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith\nThat's not really about loving others, is it?\nWe're taught to love others, but then the practice isn't always in line with that teaching\nIt's outdated, but they keep up with it\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop pedophilic behavior\nBecause it's different from having a spouse\nPedophiles likely wouldn't stop because they're married or not",
            "Um, I haven’t quite made up my mind on this issue yet. So, I can’t definitively say whether either side is right or wrong. But, I do believe this is one of the trickiest topics we’re dealing with today. It’s so close to the line between church and state, and figuring out how to define marriage without offending anyone is a real challenge. I don’t know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as a civil union, and not something the government should intervene with, for fear of offending religious sensibilities. After all, if people are married, they should be looked at as any other couple in a civil union. The whole idea of defining marriage is quite tricky, especially when it comes to something like same-sex marriage. If all states can come to a logical conclusion about it, then I think they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems ridiculous. It’s just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a gray area for me. I have many gay friends, and I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on its own. Many states are democratic, and they will likely push for gay marriage. If you're living in a democratic state, you should respect the decision of that state, as you've chosen to live there. Therefore, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals and that each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage on their own. I don't think President Bush should impose a national ban on gay marriage; it should be up to each individual state. I just don't think he can decide for the entire country, as he doesn't live in every state. Plus, he'll be out of office soon. A change in the presidency might just bring about a different policy. So, it should be up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision.",
            "Some people are under the impression that they can share personal information on the internet without consequence. But let's break this down. A social networking site like Myspace, by definition, is intended for public viewing. If you post something on the web, you're doing so with the understanding that others, including school officials, can see it. Whether it's under the school's name or not, they can access it through their homes. Now, I'm not saying that school officials should use the internet to snoop on students. That's an invasion of privacy. But if the information they find could prevent a school shooting or make the school a safer place, then I believe they have every right to monitor it. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe environment when they're dropped off at school. And the school system has a responsibility to ensure that. We practice lock downs and drills to prepare for emergencies, including school shootings. So, if school officials find information that could help prevent such tragedies, it's not an invasion of privacy; it's them doing their job to keep students safe.",
            "I was initially all for the war. I was deeply affected by 9/11 and wanted to strike back. However, in hindsight, I think we overlooked many factors and rushed into the conflict without a clear plan. I now believe that it backfired on us. Initially, I was all for it, but my perspective has since shifted. I don't think our presence in the region is making any difference. They are too busy fighting amongst themselves to fight against us. I think we should just leave. I don't think we were prepared for what we found there, and the concept of war is different for them than it is for us. They don't seem interested in improving their country, only in getting us to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion than logic. We went in seeking revenge, and President Bush acted based on public sentiment. We had to declare war, but we could have done so with a better plan. I don't think we made enough progress to warrant staying. The longer we stay, the more it seems like it will collapse once we leave. I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying. I don't think we can change those people, and it's time to admit that our efforts haven't been successful."

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I think the Catholic Church could use a bit of an update in its views. It's no secret that the Church has been losing some of its adherents, and I believe this is due to its rigid stance on certain issues. For instance, it's a bit old-fashioned to outright reject gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might retain its following. More and more people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics and feel that its views are outdated. Take abortion, for example. If you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a faith that considers abortion wrong. Similarly, if you're an advocate for same-sex marriage, you might struggle with the Church's opposition. I'm not saying female priests or married priests would solve all the Church's issues, but I do believe it's time for them to consider these changes. The world has changed, and the Church should too.",
            "Well, I'm not against same-sex marriage. I mean, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to make that distinction.\n\nIt's not like people choose to be gay. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held accountable for. It seems more like a biological thing, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue; it's more of a personal choice. I mean, it's not like it affects national security or moral concerns. It just seems like the government is overstepping their bounds. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives. And, I mean, that's who they are—they're gay, that's just how they were born. They shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "Allowing homosexual couples to marry is a topic that I believe should be legalized. While some people assert that gay couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I argue that the differences are vast and multifaceted, making it impossible to equate them to the heterosexual norm. It's like comparing the heads and tails of a coin — fundamentally different yet essentially the same in many ways.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where gay partners may be excluded from being in the room with their sick spouse or unable to visit them in a hospital. I find it silly to deny such basic human rights to those who are spending the rest of their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples share the same rates of relationship satisfaction and the same factors that contribute to a successful partnership as heterosexual couples. They are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, a simple document provided by the government, devoid of religious involvement. Asking for the same legal rights as heterosexual couples is not asking for the church's blessing; it's asking for equal treatment under the law.\n\nThe issue of adoption and community acceptance also arises, with concerns about how children of gay couples will fare. However, these are new topics and it's challenging to predict their outcomes. In New York City, for instance, there are special schools for children of gay parents due to bullying and social issues. However, the quality of parenting should be the same regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nI advocate for the federal government to legalize gay marriage nationwide. The proposed amendment banning it is not only unethical but also hypocritical, considering the country's religious divisions, such as the \"Under God\" controversy in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage from trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by institutions like the American Psychological Association.\n\nI believe it's crucial for people to rely on credible research and studies rather than popular opinions or religious beliefs to form their views on this matter. It's not just about being anti-gay or anti-marriage but about embracing a diverse and inclusive society.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has positive properties. I mean, should we make it available to the public? Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes, I'd say so. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it’s beneficial. It's not.\n\nTake drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—these are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a taboo around it, then we're not being rational.\n\nSure, I don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as some people might think. If you abuse either, it can lead to bad things, but it's a tough one. I'd suggest integrating it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have such a negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we can change that image, people might use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back at my younger days, I would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse when going to church every Sunday. Now, it's more casual. They've introduced a teenager's mass, which is only 30 minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer when you see folks coming in from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. The church I know, I don't delve into its political aspects, but it seems to be more accommodating.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and become pedophiles still have attractions towards children, regardless of marital status. Some religions allow their ministers to marry, like on Seventh Heaven, but that doesn't guarantee the abuse won't happen. If a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion. As for pedophilia, I believe it's largely genetic, not something people are brought up to be. You can't hide this through marriage, as it usually comes out. The church might have known in some cases and covered it up, but I don't think this was the norm.\n\nI don't have other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the premise, but everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went into Iraq under a false pretext. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war really disturbs me.\n\nThe Bush administration openly lied to the American people about these issues and hasn't taken responsibility for it, not even Colin Powell, who, despite his UN presentation, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. They've demonstrated a disregard for the constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can't recall the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book, but it seems the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. Long-term, he likely sought to expand our energy supply, which is rather underhanded. I believe it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to civil war, resulting in more deaths.\n\nThe UN and U.S. are considering a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that could cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and major political factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party hold significant influence. The political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I said, \"So, you want to know my thoughts on the War in Iraq? Well, let me tell you, it's a bit of a complicated topic.\n\nYou see, I don't really follow it closely, but from what I gather, it seems like it's become something of an endless operation. It's not like it was a declared war, and it's not clear what the real goal is anymore. I mean, we went in because we thought Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks, but now it's just about trying to build democracy and maybe get some oil. It's a bit pointless, if you ask me.\n\nI get it, we want to help, but are we really making things better? It's like trying to build a house without a blueprint. Democracy can't just be built overnight. And if we leave, they'll just have to start all over again. Plus, it's so controversial, people are getting upset.\n\nI don't know, I guess I'm torn. I don't want to see all those families hurting because their loved ones are over there. But I also don't want to be a part of something that's just causing more problems. It's a tough call.\n\nWell, I guess that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a tough topic, isn't it?\"",
            "I'm not sure it's appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to pass a law declaring it legal. I believe it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the Constitution itself states the principle of separation of church and state. It's clearly stated, and I think any attempt to impose rules on it would go against what's already written in stone. I think people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one religion's beliefs over others. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can or cannot make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution that ensures religious tolerance. I don't think making an amendment about this issue would be right, as it would go against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal religious beliefs as a Catholic. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't a strong reason backing the amendment other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society without affecting the economy. I've said most of what I wanted to say.",
            "From the get-go, it's my belief that the U.S. government wasn't entirely truthful with the American public about the rationale behind invading Iraq. Before the 2003 invasion, there was a concerted effort to link the war with the September 11 attacks, despite the two events being largely disconnected. The government exploited the public's outrage over the terrorist attacks to fuel the invasion. Personally, I'm opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. In my view, the Iraq War is a reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from the past but instead, they found themselves in a familiar mess. Many American soldiers have lost their lives, and the government appeared ill-prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They tried to establish a democratic government, a task that proved far more challenging than anticipated. The U.S. government should have anticipated a prolonged struggle, similar to the one we faced in Vietnam, where we were fighting a guerrilla war against civilians. The U.S. has been there since 2003, and it's still a work in progress. The U.S. government didn't plan for the long haul, and the war has been billed as a quick success, which is naïve given the complexities involved. The war in Iraq is a complex issue, and it's not easy to decide whether to stay and finish what we started or to withdraw and risk abandoning the people we've displaced. The political and economic interests, including the control of oil resources, play a significant role in U.S. foreign policy decisions. We've seen that weapons of mass destruction weren't found in Iraq, yet we haven't targeted other nations with such weapons. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to the region, though it's not likely to be a swift resolution.",
            "Well, let's see, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. It's a matter of personal preference, and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological. I believe it's inhumane to deny people rights over something they have no control over. I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics and government should have a role in this; it's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, not married because they're not allowed to be. But they function the same way as any other family. With Bush trying to interpret marriage in his own way, I think it's ridiculous. I've read various reports saying it might be a chemical predisposition to be homosexual, not necessarily due to upbringing. Other than that, marriage is something that two people can do without anyone knowing if they're straight or gay. Why make it a public issue? It should be a private matter, not a federal one.",
            "Well, let me put it this way: when you post something online, you're essentially speaking into a microphone in a crowded room. It's not just that your words are out there for everyone to see, but you're also opening yourself up to scrutiny and interpretation. You can't have it both ways. If you talk about, say, explosives or gun violence, someone's going to pick up on it, and they might take it seriously, even if you don't. It's happened before. In our school, someone overheard a discussion and reported it to the authorities. When they found the source, they discovered they had posted some concerning stuff on Facebook. It was meant as a joke, but in that context, it became serious. The internet is a public forum, so you can't control what people see or how they react. If you don't want them to see it, don't put it out there. And sure, if you don't want your teachers or school officials to see it, don't add them as friends on social media. But if someone brings it to their attention, well, that's a different story. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger. It's their job to protect everyone. And I wouldn't friend my residents either because that's just crossing a line. It's not their place to monitor our Facebook and Myspace accounts. But if it's brought to their attention, that's on the person who shared it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone else is the one bringing it up. Just remember, if you put something out there, you can't control how it's perceived or who sees it.",
            "I feel like the war has been unnecessarily prolonged. Initially, the purpose was noble—restoring democracy in a country that lacked it. But we've since lost sight of that goal. I believe the original motivation was somewhat questionable, tied to the elder Bush's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. While providing democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant is a valid cause, we've lost our focus over time. The conflict has dragged on for years, and it seems we're now fighting to prove our dominance as a superpower. The money being spent could be better used to address our own issues, like poverty and infrastructure. It's become a drain on our economy, and we should allow the local government to handle things on their own.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone saw it online.\n\nOk, um...\n\nNo, I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. And if you have to be a member to see someone’s profile, you’re giving them permission to see it by accepting them as your friend.\n\nSo, any information you put on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um...\n\nThat’s tough because obviously you can’t have one person checking everyone’s profiles all day. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they’re only looking at the \"bad kids.\"\n\nUm, I don’t think it would be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nSure, I don’t have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I’ve seen something on TV about a man who easily got someone’s screen name and met with them in less than a minute.\n\nIt’s hard because you think they know your interests, your appearance, your schedule, your friends, and they can see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I also want to communicate with my friends.\n\nSo, it’s a tricky issue because I only accept people I know.\n\nHum, uh...\n\nWell, I heard my roommate’s high school banned students from having Myspace. I don’t know how high school officials had the power to do that, or if that’s a privacy issue.

            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and one more point about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the chorus of those who claim they were against it from the beginning\nUm\nI was but, like, it’s not really important anymore\nBecause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, um\nYou just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, global polls\nAnd the bottom line is, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis,\nSeventy percent of the troops over there think it was a bad idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI mean, it’s been a complete disaster from the start\nIt was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between the United States and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap\nAnd I don’t think any administration can understand it\nOr previous administrations\nAnd they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nUm\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he wasn’t\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these are the people that we’re trying to save\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I definitely still see gender discrimination as a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; it also affects individuals in specific industries or fields due to societal expectations and biases.\n\nFor instance, in the business world, even though equality is theoretically supposed to exist, many people still struggle to work under a woman in a leadership position. This isn't just because of historical inequities; it's also due to deeply ingrained societal norms. Similarly, in the home, men who choose to stay at home as primary caregivers often face societal judgment and disapproval, despite the fact that their wives might be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are into fashion often face skepticism, particularly if they're straight. The assumption is that they might not understand what women want in fashion, leading to a general lack of trust in their abilities.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these issues exist, they're slowly changing. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being accepted in the business world. Men staying at home as fathers are also becoming more accepted, as society begins to realize that roles can be reversed based on individual circumstances.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote positive examples without being overly forceful. By showcasing the qualities and capabilities of those who are stereotyped or discriminated against, we can slowly shift societal perceptions. After all, change takes time, and we've already come a long way from the 1800s.",
            "So, the situation here is that they didn't make it legal, they just decriminalized it, which basically means it's not considered a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You know, when someone gets caught, they just get cited, rather than booked, arrested, and brought in. And, of course, there are still consequences for a marijuana charge, especially in terms of job interviews, but it's not as severe as a regular drug charge. The argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and house people, and it costs a lot to bring them to court and appoint public defenders. Plus, there are the financial benefits for the municipality, like being able to spend more on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Of course, there are also other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized, like the fact that if it were, it could be sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere, which could lead to people smoking and driving. Plus, it's still considered taboo in many places and contexts, and just the thought of it being out in the open might be awkward for some people. And, personally, I don't really know how I feel about it. I think in general, marijuana has more adverse effects on a person's lifestyle than alcohol does, but again, no two people react the same way. It's hard to generalize, but both substances have their own adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree\nYou see\nMany Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing things the same way for ages\nAnd that's important\nBut you also need to be adaptable to change\nYou know\nA lot of Catholics have strict rules about church attendance and how they're done\nSometimes it feels like the Church looks down on people who don't fully follow their teachings\nAnd they don't accept people of other religions either\nMy folks, for instance, were from different backgrounds\nMy mom was Catholic, but my dad was Episcopalian\nThey wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith\nThat's not really about loving others, is it?\nWe're taught to love others, but then the practice isn't always in line with that teaching\nIt's outdated, but they keep up with it\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop pedophilic behavior\nBecause it's different from having a spouse\nPedophiles likely wouldn't stop because they're married or not",
            "Um, I haven’t quite made up my mind on this issue yet. So, I can’t definitively say whether either side is right or wrong. But, I do believe this is one of the trickiest topics we’re dealing with today. It’s so close to the line between church and state, and figuring out how to define marriage without offending anyone is a real challenge. I don’t know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as a civil union, and not something the government should intervene with, for fear of offending religious sensibilities. After all, if people are married, they should be looked at as any other couple in a civil union. The whole idea of defining marriage is quite tricky, especially when it comes to something like same-sex marriage. If all states can come to a logical conclusion about it, then I think they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems ridiculous. It’s just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a gray area for me. I have many gay friends, and I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on its own. Many states are democratic, and they will likely push for gay marriage. If you're living in a democratic state, you should respect the decision of that state, as you've chosen to live there. Therefore, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals and that each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage on their own. I don't think President Bush should impose a national ban on gay marriage; it should be up to each individual state. I just don't think he can decide for the entire country, as he doesn't live in every state. Plus, he'll be out of office soon. A change in the presidency might just bring about a different policy. So, it should be up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision.",
            "Some people are under the impression that they can share personal information on the internet without consequence. But let's break this down. A social networking site like Myspace, by definition, is intended for public viewing. If you post something on the web, you're doing so with the understanding that others, including school officials, can see it. Whether it's under the school's name or not, they can access it through their homes. Now, I'm not saying that school officials should use the internet to snoop on students. That's an invasion of privacy. But if the information they find could prevent a school shooting or make the school a safer place, then I believe they have every right to monitor it. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe environment when they're dropped off at school. And the school system has a responsibility to ensure that. We practice lock downs and drills to prepare for emergencies, including school shootings. So, if school officials find information that could help prevent such tragedies, it's not an invasion of privacy; it's them doing their job to keep students safe.",
            "I was initially all for the war. I was deeply affected by 9/11 and wanted to strike back. However, in hindsight, I think we overlooked many factors and rushed into the conflict without a clear plan. I now believe that it backfired on us. Initially, I was all for it, but my perspective has since shifted. I don't think our presence in the region is making any difference. They are too busy fighting amongst themselves to fight against us. I think we should just leave. I don't think we were prepared for what we found there, and the concept of war is different for them than it is for us. They don't seem interested in improving their country, only in getting us to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion than logic. We went in seeking revenge, and President Bush acted based on public sentiment. We had to declare war, but we could have done so with a better plan. I don't think we made enough progress to warrant staying. The longer we stay, the more it seems like it will collapse once we leave. I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying. I don't think we can change those people, and it's time to admit that our efforts haven't been successful."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I think the Catholic Church could use a bit of an update in its views. It's no secret that the Church has been losing some of its adherents, and I believe this is due to its rigid stance on certain issues. For instance, it's a bit old-fashioned to outright reject gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might retain its following. More and more people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics and feel that its views are outdated. Take abortion, for example. If you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a faith that considers abortion wrong. Similarly, if you're an advocate for same-sex marriage, you might struggle with the Church's opposition. I'm not saying female priests or married priests would solve all the Church's issues, but I do believe it's time for them to consider these changes. The world has changed, and the Church should too.",
            "Well, I'm not against same-sex marriage. I mean, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to make that distinction.\n\nIt's not like people choose to be gay. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held accountable for. It seems more like a biological thing, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue; it's more of a personal choice. I mean, it's not like it affects national security or moral concerns. It just seems like the government is overstepping their bounds. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives. And, I mean, that's who they are—they're gay, that's just how they were born. They shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "Allowing homosexual couples to marry is a topic that I believe should be legalized. While some people assert that gay couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I argue that the differences are vast and multifaceted, making it impossible to equate them to the heterosexual norm. It's like comparing the heads and tails of a coin — fundamentally different yet essentially the same in many ways.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where gay partners may be excluded from being in the room with their sick spouse or unable to visit them in a hospital. I find it silly to deny such basic human rights to those who are spending the rest of their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples share the same rates of relationship satisfaction and the same factors that contribute to a successful partnership as heterosexual couples. They are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, a simple document provided by the government, devoid of religious involvement. Asking for the same legal rights as heterosexual couples is not asking for the church's blessing; it's asking for equal treatment under the law.\n\nThe issue of adoption and community acceptance also arises, with concerns about how children of gay couples will fare. However, these are new topics and it's challenging to predict their outcomes. In New York City, for instance, there are special schools for children of gay parents due to bullying and social issues. However, the quality of parenting should be the same regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nI advocate for the federal government to legalize gay marriage nationwide. The proposed amendment banning it is not only unethical but also hypocritical, considering the country's religious divisions, such as the \"Under God\" controversy in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage from trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by institutions like the American Psychological Association.\n\nI believe it's crucial for people to rely on credible research and studies rather than popular opinions or religious beliefs to form their views on this matter. It's not just about being anti-gay or anti-marriage but about embracing a diverse and inclusive society.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has positive properties. I mean, should we make it available to the public? Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes, I'd say so. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it’s beneficial. It's not.\n\nTake drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—these are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a taboo around it, then we're not being rational.\n\nSure, I don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as some people might think. If you abuse either, it can lead to bad things, but it's a tough one. I'd suggest integrating it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have such a negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we can change that image, people might use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back at my younger days, I would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse when going to church every Sunday. Now, it's more casual. They've introduced a teenager's mass, which is only 30 minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer when you see folks coming in from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. The church I know, I don't delve into its political aspects, but it seems to be more accommodating.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and become pedophiles still have attractions towards children, regardless of marital status. Some religions allow their ministers to marry, like on Seventh Heaven, but that doesn't guarantee the abuse won't happen. If a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion. As for pedophilia, I believe it's largely genetic, not something people are brought up to be. You can't hide this through marriage, as it usually comes out. The church might have known in some cases and covered it up, but I don't think this was the norm.\n\nI don't have other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the premise, but everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went into Iraq under a false pretext. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war really disturbs me.\n\nThe Bush administration openly lied to the American people about these issues and hasn't taken responsibility for it, not even Colin Powell, who, despite his UN presentation, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. They've demonstrated a disregard for the constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can't recall the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book, but it seems the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. Long-term, he likely sought to expand our energy supply, which is rather underhanded. I believe it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to civil war, resulting in more deaths.\n\nThe UN and U.S. are considering a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that could cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and major political factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party hold significant influence. The political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I said, \"So, you want to know my thoughts on the War in Iraq? Well, let me tell you, it's a bit of a complicated topic.\n\nYou see, I don't really follow it closely, but from what I gather, it seems like it's become something of an endless operation. It's not like it was a declared war, and it's not clear what the real goal is anymore. I mean, we went in because we thought Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks, but now it's just about trying to build democracy and maybe get some oil. It's a bit pointless, if you ask me.\n\nI get it, we want to help, but are we really making things better? It's like trying to build a house without a blueprint. Democracy can't just be built overnight. And if we leave, they'll just have to start all over again. Plus, it's so controversial, people are getting upset.\n\nI don't know, I guess I'm torn. I don't want to see all those families hurting because their loved ones are over there. But I also don't want to be a part of something that's just causing more problems. It's a tough call.\n\nWell, I guess that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a tough topic, isn't it?\"",
            "I'm not sure it's appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to pass a law declaring it legal. I believe it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the Constitution itself states the principle of separation of church and state. It's clearly stated, and I think any attempt to impose rules on it would go against what's already written in stone. I think people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one religion's beliefs over others. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can or cannot make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution that ensures religious tolerance. I don't think making an amendment about this issue would be right, as it would go against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal religious beliefs as a Catholic. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't a strong reason backing the amendment other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society without affecting the economy. I've said most of what I wanted to say.",
            "From the get-go, it's my belief that the U.S. government wasn't entirely truthful with the American public about the rationale behind invading Iraq. Before the 2003 invasion, there was a concerted effort to link the war with the September 11 attacks, despite the two events being largely disconnected. The government exploited the public's outrage over the terrorist attacks to fuel the invasion. Personally, I'm opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. In my view, the Iraq War is a reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from the past but instead, they found themselves in a familiar mess. Many American soldiers have lost their lives, and the government appeared ill-prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They tried to establish a democratic government, a task that proved far more challenging than anticipated. The U.S. government should have anticipated a prolonged struggle, similar to the one we faced in Vietnam, where we were fighting a guerrilla war against civilians. The U.S. has been there since 2003, and it's still a work in progress. The U.S. government didn't plan for the long haul, and the war has been billed as a quick success, which is naïve given the complexities involved. The war in Iraq is a complex issue, and it's not easy to decide whether to stay and finish what we started or to withdraw and risk abandoning the people we've displaced. The political and economic interests, including the control of oil resources, play a significant role in U.S. foreign policy decisions. We've seen that weapons of mass destruction weren't found in Iraq, yet we haven't targeted other nations with such weapons. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to the region, though it's not likely to be a swift resolution.",
            "Well, let's see, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. It's a matter of personal preference, and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological. I believe it's inhumane to deny people rights over something they have no control over. I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics and government should have a role in this; it's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, not married because they're not allowed to be. But they function the same way as any other family. With Bush trying to interpret marriage in his own way, I think it's ridiculous. I've read various reports saying it might be a chemical predisposition to be homosexual, not necessarily due to upbringing. Other than that, marriage is something that two people can do without anyone knowing if they're straight or gay. Why make it a public issue? It should be a private matter, not a federal one.",
            "Well, let me put it this way: when you post something online, you're essentially speaking into a microphone in a crowded room. It's not just that your words are out there for everyone to see, but you're also opening yourself up to scrutiny and interpretation. You can't have it both ways. If you talk about, say, explosives or gun violence, someone's going to pick up on it, and they might take it seriously, even if you don't. It's happened before. In our school, someone overheard a discussion and reported it to the authorities. When they found the source, they discovered they had posted some concerning stuff on Facebook. It was meant as a joke, but in that context, it became serious. The internet is a public forum, so you can't control what people see or how they react. If you don't want them to see it, don't put it out there. And sure, if you don't want your teachers or school officials to see it, don't add them as friends on social media. But if someone brings it to their attention, well, that's a different story. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger. It's their job to protect everyone. And I wouldn't friend my residents either because that's just crossing a line. It's not their place to monitor our Facebook and Myspace accounts. But if it's brought to their attention, that's on the person who shared it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone else is the one bringing it up. Just remember, if you put something out there, you can't control how it's perceived or who sees it.",
            "I feel like the war has been unnecessarily prolonged. Initially, the purpose was noble—restoring democracy in a country that lacked it. But we've since lost sight of that goal. I believe the original motivation was somewhat questionable, tied to the elder Bush's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. While providing democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant is a valid cause, we've lost our focus over time. The conflict has dragged on for years, and it seems we're now fighting to prove our dominance as a superpower. The money being spent could be better used to address our own issues, like poverty and infrastructure. It's become a drain on our economy, and we should allow the local government to handle things on their own.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone saw it online.\n\nOk, um...\n\nNo, I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. And if you have to be a member to see someone’s profile, you’re giving them permission to see it by accepting them as your friend.\n\nSo, any information you put on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um...\n\nThat’s tough because obviously you can’t have one person checking everyone’s profiles all day. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they’re only looking at the \"bad kids.\"\n\nUm, I don’t think it would be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nSure, I don’t have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I’ve seen something on TV about a man who easily got someone’s screen name and met with them in less than a minute.\n\nIt’s hard because you think they know your interests, your appearance, your schedule, your friends, and they can see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I also want to communicate with my friends.\n\nSo, it’s a tricky issue because I only accept people I know.\n\nHum, uh...\n\nWell, I heard my roommate’s high school banned students from having Myspace. I don’t know how high school officials had the power to do that, or if that’s a privacy issue.

            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and one more point about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the chorus of those who claim they were against it from the beginning\nUm\nI was but, like, it’s not really important anymore\nBecause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, um\nYou just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, global polls\nAnd the bottom line is, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis,\nSeventy percent of the troops over there think it was a bad idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI mean, it’s been a complete disaster from the start\nIt was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between the United States and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap\nAnd I don’t think any administration can understand it\nOr previous administrations\nAnd they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nUm\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he wasn’t\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these are the people that we’re trying to save\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I definitely still see gender discrimination as a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; it also affects individuals in specific industries or fields due to societal expectations and biases.\n\nFor instance, in the business world, even though equality is theoretically supposed to exist, many people still struggle to work under a woman in a leadership position. This isn't just because of historical inequities; it's also due to deeply ingrained societal norms. Similarly, in the home, men who choose to stay at home as primary caregivers often face societal judgment and disapproval, despite the fact that their wives might be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are into fashion often face skepticism, particularly if they're straight. The assumption is that they might not understand what women want in fashion, leading to a general lack of trust in their abilities.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these issues exist, they're slowly changing. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being accepted in the business world. Men staying at home as fathers are also becoming more accepted, as society begins to realize that roles can be reversed based on individual circumstances.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote positive examples without being overly forceful. By showcasing the qualities and capabilities of those who are stereotyped or discriminated against, we can slowly shift societal perceptions. After all, change takes time, and we've already come a long way from the 1800s.",
            "So, the situation here is that they didn't make it legal, they just decriminalized it, which basically means it's not considered a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You know, when someone gets caught, they just get cited, rather than booked, arrested, and brought in. And, of course, there are still consequences for a marijuana charge, especially in terms of job interviews, but it's not as severe as a regular drug charge. The argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and house people, and it costs a lot to bring them to court and appoint public defenders. Plus, there are the financial benefits for the municipality, like being able to spend more on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Of course, there are also other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized, like the fact that if it were, it could be sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere, which could lead to people smoking and driving. Plus, it's still considered taboo in many places and contexts, and just the thought of it being out in the open might be awkward for some people. And, personally, I don't really know how I feel about it. I think in general, marijuana has more adverse effects on a person's lifestyle than alcohol does, but again, no two people react the same way. It's hard to generalize, but both substances have their own adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree\nYou see\nMany Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing things the same way for ages\nAnd that's important\nBut you also need to be adaptable to change\nYou know\nA lot of Catholics have strict rules about church attendance and how they're done\nSometimes it feels like the Church looks down on people who don't fully follow their teachings\nAnd they don't accept people of other religions either\nMy folks, for instance, were from different backgrounds\nMy mom was Catholic, but my dad was Episcopalian\nThey wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith\nThat's not really about loving others, is it?\nWe're taught to love others, but then the practice isn't always in line with that teaching\nIt's outdated, but they keep up with it\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop pedophilic behavior\nBecause it's different from having a spouse\nPedophiles likely wouldn't stop because they're married or not",
            "Um, I haven’t quite made up my mind on this issue yet. So, I can’t definitively say whether either side is right or wrong. But, I do believe this is one of the trickiest topics we’re dealing with today. It’s so close to the line between church and state, and figuring out how to define marriage without offending anyone is a real challenge. I don’t know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as a civil union, and not something the government should intervene with, for fear of offending religious sensibilities. After all, if people are married, they should be looked at as any other couple in a civil union. The whole idea of defining marriage is quite tricky, especially when it comes to something like same-sex marriage. If all states can come to a logical conclusion about it, then I think they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems ridiculous. It’s just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a gray area for me. I have many gay friends, and I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on its own. Many states are democratic, and they will likely push for gay marriage. If you're living in a democratic state, you should respect the decision of that state, as you've chosen to live there. Therefore, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals and that each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage on their own. I don't think President Bush should impose a national ban on gay marriage; it should be up to each individual state. I just don't think he can decide for the entire country, as he doesn't live in every state. Plus, he'll be out of office soon. A change in the presidency might just bring about a different policy. So, it should be up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision.",
            "Some people are under the impression that they can share personal information on the internet without consequence. But let's break this down. A social networking site like Myspace, by definition, is intended for public viewing. If you post something on the web, you're doing so with the understanding that others, including school officials, can see it. Whether it's under the school's name or not, they can access it through their homes. Now, I'm not saying that school officials should use the internet to snoop on students. That's an invasion of privacy. But if the information they find could prevent a school shooting or make the school a safer place, then I believe they have every right to monitor it. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe environment when they're dropped off at school. And the school system has a responsibility to ensure that. We practice lock downs and drills to prepare for emergencies, including school shootings. So, if school officials find information that could help prevent such tragedies, it's not an invasion of privacy; it's them doing their job to keep students safe.",
            "I was initially all for the war. I was deeply affected by 9/11 and wanted to strike back. However, in hindsight, I think we overlooked many factors and rushed into the conflict without a clear plan. I now believe that it backfired on us. Initially, I was all for it, but my perspective has since shifted. I don't think our presence in the region is making any difference. They are too busy fighting amongst themselves to fight against us. I think we should just leave. I don't think we were prepared for what we found there, and the concept of war is different for them than it is for us. They don't seem interested in improving their country, only in getting us to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion than logic. We went in seeking revenge, and President Bush acted based on public sentiment. We had to declare war, but we could have done so with a better plan. I don't think we made enough progress to warrant staying. The longer we stay, the more it seems like it will collapse once we leave. I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying. I don't think we can change those people, and it's time to admit that our efforts haven't been successful."
