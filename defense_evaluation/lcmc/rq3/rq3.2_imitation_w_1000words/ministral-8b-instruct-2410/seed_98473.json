            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I think the Catholic Church could use a bit of an update in its views. It's no secret that the Church has been losing some of its adherents, and I believe this is due to its rigid stance on certain issues. For instance, it's a bit old-fashioned to outright reject gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might retain its following. More and more people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics and feel that its views are outdated. Take abortion, for example. If you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a faith that considers abortion wrong. Similarly, if you're an advocate for same-sex marriage, you might struggle with the Church's opposition. I'm not saying female priests or married priests would solve all the Church's issues, but I do believe it's time for them to consider these changes. The world has changed, and the Church should too.",
            "Well, I'm not against same-sex marriage. I mean, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to make that distinction.\n\nIt's not like people choose to be gay. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held accountable for. It seems more like a biological thing, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue; it's more of a personal choice. I mean, it's not like it affects national security or moral concerns. It just seems like the government is overstepping their bounds. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives. And, I mean, that's who they are—they're gay, that's just how they were born. They shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "Allowing homosexual couples to marry is a topic that I believe should be legalized. While some people assert that gay couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I argue that the differences are vast and multifaceted, making it impossible to equate them to the heterosexual norm. It's like comparing the heads and tails of a coin — fundamentally different yet essentially the same in many ways.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where gay partners may be excluded from being in the room with their sick spouse or unable to visit them in a hospital. I find it silly to deny such basic human rights to those who are spending the rest of their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples share the same rates of relationship satisfaction and the same factors that contribute to a successful partnership as heterosexual couples. They are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, a simple document provided by the government, devoid of religious involvement. Asking for the same legal rights as heterosexual couples is not asking for the church's blessing; it's asking for equal treatment under the law.\n\nThe issue of adoption and community acceptance also arises, with concerns about how children of gay couples will fare. However, these are new topics and it's challenging to predict their outcomes. In New York City, for instance, there are special schools for children of gay parents due to bullying and social issues. However, the quality of parenting should be the same regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nI advocate for the federal government to legalize gay marriage nationwide. The proposed amendment banning it is not only unethical but also hypocritical, considering the country's religious divisions, such as the \"Under God\" controversy in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage from trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by institutions like the American Psychological Association.\n\nI believe it's crucial for people to rely on credible research and studies rather than popular opinions or religious beliefs to form their views on this matter. It's not just about being anti-gay or anti-marriage but about embracing a diverse and inclusive society.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has positive properties. I mean, should we make it available to the public? Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes, I'd say so. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it’s beneficial. It's not.\n\nTake drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—these are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a taboo around it, then we're not being rational.\n\nSure, I don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as some people might think. If you abuse either, it can lead to bad things, but it's a tough one. I'd suggest integrating it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have such a negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we can change that image, people might use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back at my younger days, I would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse when going to church every Sunday. Now, it's more casual. They've introduced a teenager's mass, which is only 30 minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer when you see folks coming in from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. The church I know, I don't delve into its political aspects, but it seems to be more accommodating.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and become pedophiles still have attractions towards children, regardless of marital status. Some religions allow their ministers to marry, like on Seventh Heaven, but that doesn't guarantee the abuse won't happen. If a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion. As for pedophilia, I believe it's largely genetic, not something people are brought up to be. You can't hide this through marriage, as it usually comes out. The church might have known in some cases and covered it up, but I don't think this was the norm.\n\nI don't have other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the premise, but everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went into Iraq under a false pretext. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war really disturbs me.\n\nThe Bush administration openly lied to the American people about these issues and hasn't taken responsibility for it, not even Colin Powell, who, despite his UN presentation, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. They've demonstrated a disregard for the constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can't recall the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book, but it seems the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. Long-term, he likely sought to expand our energy supply, which is rather underhanded. I believe it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to civil war, resulting in more deaths.\n\nThe UN and U.S. are considering a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that could cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and major political factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party hold significant influence. The political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate in polite company.",

Well, let me tell you, it's a bit of a complicated topic.\n\nYou see, I don't really follow it closely, but from what I gather, it seems like it's become something of an endless operation. It's not like it was a declared war, and it's not clear what the real goal is anymore. I mean, we went in because we thought Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks, but now it's just about trying to build democracy and maybe get some oil. It's a bit pointless, if you ask me.\n\nI get it, we want to help, but are we really making things better? It's like trying to build a house without a blueprint. Democracy can't just be built overnight. And if we leave, they'll just have to start all over again. Plus, it's so controversial, people are getting upset.\n\nI don't know, I guess I'm torn. I don't want to see all those families hurting because their loved ones are over there. But I also don't want to be a part of something that's just causing more problems. It's a tough call.\n\nWell, I guess that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a tough topic, isn't it?\"",
            "I'm not sure it's appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to pass a law declaring it legal. I believe it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the Constitution itself states the principle of separation of church and state. It's clearly stated, and I think any attempt to impose rules on it would go against what's already written in stone. I think people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one religion's beliefs over others. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can or cannot make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution that ensures religious tolerance. I don't think making an amendment about this issue would be right, as it would go against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal religious beliefs as a Catholic. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't a strong reason backing the amendment other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society without affecting the economy. I've said most of what I wanted to say.",
            "From the get-go, it's my belief that the U.S. government wasn't entirely truthful with the American public about the rationale behind invading Iraq. Before the 2003 invasion, there was a concerted effort to link the war with the September 11 attacks, despite the two events being largely disconnected. The government exploited the public's outrage over the terrorist attacks to fuel the invasion. Personally, I'm opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. In my view, the Iraq War is a reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from the past but instead, they found themselves in a familiar mess. Many American soldiers have lost their lives, and the government appeared ill-prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They tried to establish a democratic government, a task that proved far more challenging than anticipated. The U.S. government should have anticipated a prolonged struggle, similar to the one we faced in Vietnam, where we were fighting a guerrilla war against civilians. The U.S. has been there since 2003, and it's still a work in progress. The U.S. government didn't plan for the long haul, and the war has been billed as a quick success, which is naïve given the complexities involved. The war in Iraq is a complex issue, and it's not easy to decide whether to stay and finish what we started or to withdraw and risk abandoning the people we've displaced. The political and economic interests, including the control of oil resources, play a significant role in U.S. foreign policy decisions. We've seen that weapons of mass destruction weren't found in Iraq, yet we haven't targeted other nations with such weapons. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to the region, though it's not likely to be a swift resolution.",
            "Well, let's see, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. It's a matter of personal preference, and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological. I believe it's inhumane to deny people rights over something they have no control over. I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics and government should have a role in this; it's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, not married because they're not allowed to be. But they function the same way as any other family. With Bush trying to interpret marriage in his own way, I think it's ridiculous. I've read various reports saying it might be a chemical predisposition to be homosexual, not necessarily due to upbringing. Other than that, marriage is something that two people can do without anyone knowing if they're straight or gay. Why make it a public issue? It should be a private matter, not a federal one.",
            "Well, let me put it this way: when you post something online, you're essentially speaking into a microphone in a crowded room. It's not just that your words are out there for everyone to see, but you're also opening yourself up to scrutiny and interpretation. You can't have it both ways. If you talk about, say, explosives or gun violence, someone's going to pick up on it, and they might take it seriously, even if you don't. It's happened before. In our school, someone overheard a discussion and reported it to the authorities. When they found the source, they discovered they had posted some concerning stuff on Facebook. It was meant as a joke, but in that context, it became serious. The internet is a public forum, so you can't control what people see or how they react. If you don't want them to see it, don't put it out there. And sure, if you don't want your teachers or school officials to see it, don't add them as friends on social media. But if someone brings it to their attention, well, that's a different story. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger. It's their job to protect everyone. And I wouldn't friend my residents either because that's just crossing a line. It's not their place to monitor our Facebook and Myspace accounts. But if it's brought to their attention, that's on the person who shared it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone else is the one bringing it up. Just remember, if you put something out there, you can't control how it's perceived or who sees it.",
            "I feel like the war has been unnecessarily prolonged. Initially, the purpose was noble—restoring democracy in a country that lacked it. But we've since lost sight of that goal. I believe the original motivation was somewhat questionable, tied to the elder Bush's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. While providing democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant is a valid cause, we've lost our focus over time. The conflict has dragged on for years, and it seems we're now fighting to prove our dominance as a superpower. The money being spent could be better used to address our own issues, like poverty and infrastructure.

And if you have to be a member to see someone’s profile, you’re giving them permission to see it by accepting them as your friend.\n\nSo, any information you put on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um...\n\nThat’s tough because obviously you can’t have one person checking everyone’s profiles all day. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they’re only looking at the \"bad kids.\"\n\nUm, I don’t think it would be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nSure, I don’t have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I’ve seen something on TV about a man who easily got someone’s screen name and met with them in less than a minute.\n\nIt’s hard because you think they know your interests, your appearance, your schedule, your friends, and they can see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I also want to communicate with my friends.\n\nSo, it’s a tricky issue because I only accept people I know.\n\nHum, uh...\n\nWell, I heard my roommate’s high school banned students from having Myspace. I don’t know how high school officials had the power to do that, or if that’s a privacy issue. I’m not sure how they had the right to tell people they couldn’t have a Myspace.\n\nThat’s the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and one more point about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the chorus of those who claim they were against it from the beginning\nUm\nI was but, like, it’s not really important anymore\nBecause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, um\nYou just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, global polls\nAnd the bottom line is, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis,\nSeventy percent of the troops over there think it was a bad idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI mean, it’s been a complete disaster from the start\nIt was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between the United States and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap\nAnd I don’t think any administration can understand it\nOr previous administrations\nAnd they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nUm\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he wasn’t\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these are the people that we’re trying to save\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I definitely still see gender discrimination as a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; it also affects individuals in specific industries or fields due to societal expectations and biases.\n\nFor instance, in the business world, even though equality is theoretically supposed to exist, many people still struggle to work under a woman in a leadership position. This isn't just because of historical inequities; it's also due to deeply ingrained societal norms. Similarly, in the home, men who choose to stay at home as primary caregivers often face societal judgment and disapproval, despite the fact that their wives might be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are into fashion often face skepticism, particularly if they're straight. The assumption is that they might not understand what women want in fashion, leading to a general lack of trust in their abilities.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these issues exist, they're slowly changing. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being accepted in the business world. Men staying at home as fathers are also becoming more accepted, as society begins to realize that roles can be reversed based on individual circumstances.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote positive examples without being overly forceful. By showcasing the qualities and capabilities of those who are stereotyped or discriminated against, we can slowly shift societal perceptions. After all, change takes time, and we've already come a long way from the 1800s.",
            "So, the situation here is that they didn't make it legal, they just decriminalized it, which basically means it's not considered a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You know, when someone gets caught, they just get cited, rather than booked, arrested, and brought in. And, of course, there are still consequences for a marijuana charge, especially in terms of job interviews, but it's not as severe as a regular drug charge. The argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and house people, and it costs a lot to bring them to court and appoint public defenders. Plus, there are the financial benefits for the municipality, like being able to spend more on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Of course, there are also other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized, like the fact that if it were, it could be sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere, which could lead to people smoking and driving. Plus, it's still considered taboo in many places and contexts, and just the thought of it being out in the open might be awkward for some people. And, personally, I don't really know how I feel about it. I think in general, marijuana has more adverse effects on a person's lifestyle than alcohol does, but again, no two people react the same way. It's hard to generalize, but both substances have their own adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree\nYou see\nMany Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing things the same way for ages\nAnd that's important\nBut you also need to be adaptable to change\nYou know\nA lot of Catholics have strict rules about church attendance and how they're done\nSometimes it feels like the Church looks down on people who don't fully follow their teachings\nAnd they don't accept people of other religions either\nMy folks, for instance, were from different backgrounds\nMy mom was Catholic, but my dad was Episcopalian\nThey wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith\nThat's not really about loving others, is it?\nWe're taught to love others, but then the practice isn't always in line with that teaching\nIt's outdated, but they keep up with it\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop pedophilic behavior\nBecause it's different from having a spouse\nPedophiles likely wouldn't stop because they're married or not",
            "Um, I haven’t quite made up my mind on this issue yet. So, I can’t definitively say whether either side is right or wrong. But, I do believe this is one of the trickiest topics we’re dealing with today. It’s so close to the line between church and state, and figuring out how to define marriage without offending anyone is a real challenge. I don’t know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as a civil union, and not something the government should intervene with, for fear of offending religious sensibilities. After all, if people are married, they should be looked at as any other couple in a civil union. The whole idea of defining marriage is quite tricky, especially when it comes to something like same-sex marriage. If all states can come to a logical conclusion about it, then I think they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems ridiculous. It’s just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a gray area for me. I have many gay friends, and I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on its own. Many states are democratic, and they will likely push for gay marriage. If you're living in a democratic state, you should respect the decision of that state, as you've chosen to live there. Therefore, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals and that each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage on their own. I don't think President Bush should impose a national ban on gay marriage; it should be up to each individual state. I just don't think he can decide for the entire country, as he doesn't live in every state. Plus, he'll be out of office soon. A change in the presidency might just bring about a different policy. So, it should be up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision.",
            "Some people are under the impression that they can share personal information on the internet without consequence. But let's break this down. A social networking site like Myspace, by definition, is intended for public viewing. If you post something on the web, you're doing so with the understanding that others, including school officials, can see it. Whether it's under the school's name or not, they can access it through their homes. Now, I'm not saying that school officials should use the internet to snoop on students. That's an invasion of privacy. But if the information they find could prevent a school shooting or make the school a safer place, then I believe they have every right to monitor it. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe environment when they're dropped off at school. And the school system has a responsibility to ensure that. We practice lock downs and drills to prepare for emergencies, including school shootings. So, if school officials find information that could help prevent such tragedies, it's not an invasion of privacy; it's them doing their job to keep students safe.",
            "I was initially all for the war. I was deeply affected by 9/11 and wanted to strike back. However, in hindsight, I think we overlooked many factors and rushed into the conflict without a clear plan. I now believe that it backfired on us. Initially, I was all for it, but my perspective has since shifted. I don't think our presence in the region is making any difference. They are too busy fighting amongst themselves to fight against us. I think we should just leave. I don't think we were prepared for what we found there, and the concept of war is different for them than it is for us. They don't seem interested in improving their country, only in getting us to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion than logic. We went in seeking revenge, and President Bush acted based on public sentiment. We had to declare war, but we could have done so with a better plan. I don't think we made enough progress to warrant staying. The longer we stay, the more it seems like it will collapse once we leave. I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying. I don't think we can change those people, and it's time to admit that our efforts haven't been successful."

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I think the Catholic Church could use a bit of an update in its views. It's no secret that the Church has been losing some of its adherents, and I believe this is due to its rigid stance on certain issues. For instance, it's a bit old-fashioned to outright reject gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might retain its following. More and more people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics and feel that its views are outdated. Take abortion, for example. If you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a faith that considers abortion wrong. Similarly, if you're an advocate for same-sex marriage, you might struggle with the Church's opposition. I'm not saying female priests or married priests would solve all the Church's issues, but I do believe it's time for them to consider these changes. The world has changed, and the Church should too.",
            "Well, I'm not against same-sex marriage. I mean, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to make that distinction.\n\nIt's not like people choose to be gay. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held accountable for. It seems more like a biological thing, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue; it's more of a personal choice. I mean, it's not like it affects national security or moral concerns. It just seems like the government is overstepping their bounds. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives. And, I mean, that's who they are—they're gay, that's just how they were born. They shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "Allowing homosexual couples to marry is a topic that I believe should be legalized. While some people assert that gay couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I argue that the differences are vast and multifaceted, making it impossible to equate them to the heterosexual norm. It's like comparing the heads and tails of a coin — fundamentally different yet essentially the same in many ways.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where gay partners may be excluded from being in the room with their sick spouse or unable to visit them in a hospital. I find it silly to deny such basic human rights to those who are spending the rest of their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples share the same rates of relationship satisfaction and the same factors that contribute to a successful partnership as heterosexual couples. They are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, a simple document provided by the government, devoid of religious involvement. Asking for the same legal rights as heterosexual couples is not asking for the church's blessing; it's asking for equal treatment under the law.\n\nThe issue of adoption and community acceptance also arises, with concerns about how children of gay couples will fare. However, these are new topics and it's challenging to predict their outcomes. In New York City, for instance, there are special schools for children of gay parents due to bullying and social issues. However, the quality of parenting should be the same regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nI advocate for the federal government to legalize gay marriage nationwide. The proposed amendment banning it is not only unethical but also hypocritical, considering the country's religious divisions, such as the \"Under God\" controversy in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage from trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by institutions like the American Psychological Association.\n\nI believe it's crucial for people to rely on credible research and studies rather than popular opinions or religious beliefs to form their views on this matter. It's not just about being anti-gay or anti-marriage but about embracing a diverse and inclusive society.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has positive properties. I mean, should we make it available to the public? Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes, I'd say so. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it’s beneficial. It's not.\n\nTake drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—these are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a taboo around it, then we're not being rational.\n\nSure, I don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as some people might think. If you abuse either, it can lead to bad things, but it's a tough one. I'd suggest integrating it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have such a negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we can change that image, people might use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back at my younger days, I would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse when going to church every Sunday. Now, it's more casual. They've introduced a teenager's mass, which is only 30 minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer when you see folks coming in from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. The church I know, I don't delve into its political aspects, but it seems to be more accommodating.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and become pedophiles still have attractions towards children, regardless of marital status. Some religions allow their ministers to marry, like on Seventh Heaven, but that doesn't guarantee the abuse won't happen. If a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion. As for pedophilia, I believe it's largely genetic, not something people are brought up to be. You can't hide this through marriage, as it usually comes out. The church might have known in some cases and covered it up, but I don't think this was the norm.\n\nI don't have other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the premise, but everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went into Iraq under a false pretext. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war really disturbs me.\n\nThe Bush administration openly lied to the American people about these issues and hasn't taken responsibility for it, not even Colin Powell, who, despite his UN presentation, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. They've demonstrated a disregard for the constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can't recall the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book, but it seems the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. Long-term, he likely sought to expand our energy supply, which is rather underhanded. I believe it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to civil war, resulting in more deaths.\n\nThe UN and U.S. are considering a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that could cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and major political factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party hold significant influence. The political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I said, \"So, you want to know my thoughts on the War in Iraq? Well, let me tell you, it's a bit of a complicated topic.\n\nYou see, I don't really follow it closely, but from what I gather, it seems like it's become something of an endless operation. It's not like it was a declared war, and it's not clear what the real goal is anymore. I mean, we went in because we thought Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks, but now it's just about trying to build democracy and maybe get some oil. It's a bit pointless, if you ask me.\n\nI get it, we want to help, but are we really making things better? It's like trying to build a house without a blueprint. Democracy can't just be built overnight. And if we leave, they'll just have to start all over again. Plus, it's so controversial, people are getting upset.\n\nI don't know, I guess I'm torn. I don't want to see all those families hurting because their loved ones are over there. But I also don't want to be a part of something that's just causing more problems. It's a tough call.\n\nWell, I guess that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a tough topic, isn't it?\"",
            "I'm not sure it's appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to pass a law declaring it legal. I believe it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the Constitution itself states the principle of separation of church and state. It's clearly stated, and I think any attempt to impose rules on it would go against what's already written in stone. I think people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one religion's beliefs over others. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can or cannot make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution that ensures religious tolerance. I don't think making an amendment about this issue would be right, as it would go against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal religious beliefs as a Catholic. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't a strong reason backing the amendment other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society without affecting the economy. I've said most of what I wanted to say.",
            "From the get-go, it's my belief that the U.S. government wasn't entirely truthful with the American public about the rationale behind invading Iraq. Before the 2003 invasion, there was a concerted effort to link the war with the September 11 attacks, despite the two events being largely disconnected. The government exploited the public's outrage over the terrorist attacks to fuel the invasion. Personally, I'm opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. In my view, the Iraq War is a reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from the past but instead, they found themselves in a familiar mess. Many American soldiers have lost their lives, and the government appeared ill-prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They tried to establish a democratic government, a task that proved far more challenging than anticipated. The U.S. government should have anticipated a prolonged struggle, similar to the one we faced in Vietnam, where we were fighting a guerrilla war against civilians. The U.S. has been there since 2003, and it's still a work in progress. The U.S. government didn't plan for the long haul, and the war has been billed as a quick success, which is naïve given the complexities involved. The war in Iraq is a complex issue, and it's not easy to decide whether to stay and finish what we started or to withdraw and risk abandoning the people we've displaced. The political and economic interests, including the control of oil resources, play a significant role in U.S. foreign policy decisions. We've seen that weapons of mass destruction weren't found in Iraq, yet we haven't targeted other nations with such weapons. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to the region, though it's not likely to be a swift resolution.",
            "Well, let's see, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. It's a matter of personal preference, and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological. I believe it's inhumane to deny people rights over something they have no control over. I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics and government should have a role in this; it's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, not married because they're not allowed to be. But they function the same way as any other family. With Bush trying to interpret marriage in his own way, I think it's ridiculous. I've read various reports saying it might be a chemical predisposition to be homosexual, not necessarily due to upbringing. Other than that, marriage is something that two people can do without anyone knowing if they're straight or gay. Why make it a public issue? It should be a private matter, not a federal one.",
            "Well, let me put it this way: when you post something online, you're essentially speaking into a microphone in a crowded room. It's not just that your words are out there for everyone to see, but you're also opening yourself up to scrutiny and interpretation. You can't have it both ways. If you talk about, say, explosives or gun violence, someone's going to pick up on it, and they might take it seriously, even if you don't. It's happened before. In our school, someone overheard a discussion and reported it to the authorities. When they found the source, they discovered they had posted some concerning stuff on Facebook. It was meant as a joke, but in that context, it became serious. The internet is a public forum, so you can't control what people see or how they react. If you don't want them to see it, don't put it out there. And sure, if you don't want your teachers or school officials to see it, don't add them as friends on social media. But if someone brings it to their attention, well, that's a different story. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger. It's their job to protect everyone. And I wouldn't friend my residents either because that's just crossing a line. It's not their place to monitor our Facebook and Myspace accounts. But if it's brought to their attention, that's on the person who shared it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone else is the one bringing it up. Just remember, if you put something out there, you can't control how it's perceived or who sees it.",
            "I feel like the war has been unnecessarily prolonged. Initially, the purpose was noble—restoring democracy in a country that lacked it. But we've since lost sight of that goal. I believe the original motivation was somewhat questionable, tied to the elder Bush's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. While providing democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant is a valid cause, we've lost our focus over time. The conflict has dragged on for years, and it seems we're now fighting to prove our dominance as a superpower. The money being spent could be better used to address our own issues, like poverty and infrastructure. It's become a drain on our economy, and we should allow the local government to handle things on their own.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone saw it online.\n\nOk, um...\n\nNo, I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. And if you have to be a member to see someone’s profile, you’re giving them permission to see it by accepting them as your friend.\n\nSo, any information you put on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um...\n\nThat’s tough because obviously you can’t have one person checking everyone’s profiles all day. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they’re only looking at the \"bad kids.\"\n\nUm, I don’t think it would be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nSure, I don’t have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I’ve seen something on TV about a man who easily got someone’s screen name and met with them in less than a minute.\n\nIt’s hard because you think they know your interests, your appearance, your schedule, your friends, and they can see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I also want to communicate with my friends.\n\nSo, it’s a tricky issue because I only accept people I know.\n\nHum, uh...\n\nWell, I heard my roommate’s high school banned students from having Myspace. I don’t know how high school officials had the power to do that, or if that’s a privacy issue.

            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and one more point about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the chorus of those who claim they were against it from the beginning\nUm\nI was but, like, it’s not really important anymore\nBecause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, um\nYou just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, global polls\nAnd the bottom line is, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis,\nSeventy percent of the troops over there think it was a bad idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI mean, it’s been a complete disaster from the start\nIt was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between the United States and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap\nAnd I don’t think any administration can understand it\nOr previous administrations\nAnd they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nUm\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he wasn’t\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these are the people that we’re trying to save\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I definitely still see gender discrimination as a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; it also affects individuals in specific industries or fields due to societal expectations and biases.\n\nFor instance, in the business world, even though equality is theoretically supposed to exist, many people still struggle to work under a woman in a leadership position. This isn't just because of historical inequities; it's also due to deeply ingrained societal norms. Similarly, in the home, men who choose to stay at home as primary caregivers often face societal judgment and disapproval, despite the fact that their wives might be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are into fashion often face skepticism, particularly if they're straight. The assumption is that they might not understand what women want in fashion, leading to a general lack of trust in their abilities.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these issues exist, they're slowly changing. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being accepted in the business world. Men staying at home as fathers are also becoming more accepted, as society begins to realize that roles can be reversed based on individual circumstances.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote positive examples without being overly forceful. By showcasing the qualities and capabilities of those who are stereotyped or discriminated against, we can slowly shift societal perceptions. After all, change takes time, and we've already come a long way from the 1800s.",
            "So, the situation here is that they didn't make it legal, they just decriminalized it, which basically means it's not considered a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You know, when someone gets caught, they just get cited, rather than booked, arrested, and brought in. And, of course, there are still consequences for a marijuana charge, especially in terms of job interviews, but it's not as severe as a regular drug charge. The argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and house people, and it costs a lot to bring them to court and appoint public defenders. Plus, there are the financial benefits for the municipality, like being able to spend more on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Of course, there are also other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized, like the fact that if it were, it could be sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere, which could lead to people smoking and driving. Plus, it's still considered taboo in many places and contexts, and just the thought of it being out in the open might be awkward for some people. And, personally, I don't really know how I feel about it. I think in general, marijuana has more adverse effects on a person's lifestyle than alcohol does, but again, no two people react the same way. It's hard to generalize, but both substances have their own adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree\nYou see\nMany Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing things the same way for ages\nAnd that's important\nBut you also need to be adaptable to change\nYou know\nA lot of Catholics have strict rules about church attendance and how they're done\nSometimes it feels like the Church looks down on people who don't fully follow their teachings\nAnd they don't accept people of other religions either\nMy folks, for instance, were from different backgrounds\nMy mom was Catholic, but my dad was Episcopalian\nThey wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith\nThat's not really about loving others, is it?\nWe're taught to love others, but then the practice isn't always in line with that teaching\nIt's outdated, but they keep up with it\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop pedophilic behavior\nBecause it's different from having a spouse\nPedophiles likely wouldn't stop because they're married or not",
            "Um, I haven’t quite made up my mind on this issue yet. So, I can’t definitively say whether either side is right or wrong. But, I do believe this is one of the trickiest topics we’re dealing with today. It’s so close to the line between church and state, and figuring out how to define marriage without offending anyone is a real challenge. I don’t know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as a civil union, and not something the government should intervene with, for fear of offending religious sensibilities. After all, if people are married, they should be looked at as any other couple in a civil union. The whole idea of defining marriage is quite tricky, especially when it comes to something like same-sex marriage. If all states can come to a logical conclusion about it, then I think they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems ridiculous. It’s just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a gray area for me. I have many gay friends, and I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on its own. Many states are democratic, and they will likely push for gay marriage. If you're living in a democratic state, you should respect the decision of that state, as you've chosen to live there. Therefore, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals and that each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage on their own. I don't think President Bush should impose a national ban on gay marriage; it should be up to each individual state. I just don't think he can decide for the entire country, as he doesn't live in every state. Plus, he'll be out of office soon. A change in the presidency might just bring about a different policy. So, it should be up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision.",
            "Some people are under the impression that they can share personal information on the internet without consequence. But let's break this down. A social networking site like Myspace, by definition, is intended for public viewing. If you post something on the web, you're doing so with the understanding that others, including school officials, can see it. Whether it's under the school's name or not, they can access it through their homes. Now, I'm not saying that school officials should use the internet to snoop on students. That's an invasion of privacy. But if the information they find could prevent a school shooting or make the school a safer place, then I believe they have every right to monitor it. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe environment when they're dropped off at school. And the school system has a responsibility to ensure that. We practice lock downs and drills to prepare for emergencies, including school shootings. So, if school officials find information that could help prevent such tragedies, it's not an invasion of privacy; it's them doing their job to keep students safe.",
            "I was initially all for the war. I was deeply affected by 9/11 and wanted to strike back. However, in hindsight, I think we overlooked many factors and rushed into the conflict without a clear plan. I now believe that it backfired on us. Initially, I was all for it, but my perspective has since shifted. I don't think our presence in the region is making any difference. They are too busy fighting amongst themselves to fight against us. I think we should just leave. I don't think we were prepared for what we found there, and the concept of war is different for them than it is for us. They don't seem interested in improving their country, only in getting us to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion than logic. We went in seeking revenge, and President Bush acted based on public sentiment. We had to declare war, but we could have done so with a better plan. I don't think we made enough progress to warrant staying. The longer we stay, the more it seems like it will collapse once we leave. I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying. I don't think we can change those people, and it's time to admit that our efforts haven't been successful."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I think the Catholic Church could use a bit of an update in its views. It's no secret that the Church has been losing some of its adherents, and I believe this is due to its rigid stance on certain issues. For instance, it's a bit old-fashioned to outright reject gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might retain its following. More and more people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics and feel that its views are outdated. Take abortion, for example. If you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a faith that considers abortion wrong. Similarly, if you're an advocate for same-sex marriage, you might struggle with the Church's opposition. I'm not saying female priests or married priests would solve all the Church's issues, but I do believe it's time for them to consider these changes. The world has changed, and the Church should too.",
            "Well, I'm not against same-sex marriage. I mean, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given it much thought, but I'd definitely say it's wrong to make that distinction.\n\nIt's not like people choose to be gay. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be held accountable for. It seems more like a biological thing, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue; it's more of a personal choice. I mean, it's not like it affects national security or moral concerns. It just seems like the government is overstepping their bounds. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives. And, I mean, that's who they are—they're gay, that's just how they were born. They shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "Allowing homosexual couples to marry is a topic that I believe should be legalized. While some people assert that gay couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I argue that the differences are vast and multifaceted, making it impossible to equate them to the heterosexual norm. It's like comparing the heads and tails of a coin — fundamentally different yet essentially the same in many ways.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where gay partners may be excluded from being in the room with their sick spouse or unable to visit them in a hospital. I find it silly to deny such basic human rights to those who are spending the rest of their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples share the same rates of relationship satisfaction and the same factors that contribute to a successful partnership as heterosexual couples. They are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, a simple document provided by the government, devoid of religious involvement. Asking for the same legal rights as heterosexual couples is not asking for the church's blessing; it's asking for equal treatment under the law.\n\nThe issue of adoption and community acceptance also arises, with concerns about how children of gay couples will fare. However, these are new topics and it's challenging to predict their outcomes. In New York City, for instance, there are special schools for children of gay parents due to bullying and social issues. However, the quality of parenting should be the same regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nI advocate for the federal government to legalize gay marriage nationwide. The proposed amendment banning it is not only unethical but also hypocritical, considering the country's religious divisions, such as the \"Under God\" controversy in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage from trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by institutions like the American Psychological Association.\n\nI believe it's crucial for people to rely on credible research and studies rather than popular opinions or religious beliefs to form their views on this matter. It's not just about being anti-gay or anti-marriage but about embracing a diverse and inclusive society.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has positive properties. I mean, should we make it available to the public? Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes, I'd say so. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it’s beneficial. It's not.\n\nTake drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—these are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a taboo around it, then we're not being rational.\n\nSure, I don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as some people might think. If you abuse either, it can lead to bad things, but it's a tough one. I'd suggest integrating it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to remove the taboo around marijuana, and then people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have such a negative image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we can change that image, people might use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back at my younger days, I would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse when going to church every Sunday. Now, it's more casual. They've introduced a teenager's mass, which is only 30 minutes long and people dress more casually, especially during summer when you see folks coming in from the beach. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis. The church I know, I don't delve into its political aspects, but it seems to be more accommodating.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and become pedophiles still have attractions towards children, regardless of marital status. Some religions allow their ministers to marry, like on Seventh Heaven, but that doesn't guarantee the abuse won't happen. If a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion. As for pedophilia, I believe it's largely genetic, not something people are brought up to be. You can't hide this through marriage, as it usually comes out. The church might have known in some cases and covered it up, but I don't think this was the norm.\n\nI don't have other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was okay with the premise, but everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went into Iraq under a false pretext. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war really disturbs me.\n\nThe Bush administration openly lied to the American people about these issues and hasn't taken responsibility for it, not even Colin Powell, who, despite his UN presentation, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. They've demonstrated a disregard for the constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can't recall the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book, but it seems the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. Long-term, he likely sought to expand our energy supply, which is rather underhanded. I believe it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to civil war, resulting in more deaths.\n\nThe UN and U.S. are considering a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that could cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and major political factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party hold significant influence. The political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I said, \"So, you want to know my thoughts on the War in Iraq? Well, let me tell you, it's a bit of a complicated topic.\n\nYou see, I don't really follow it closely, but from what I gather, it seems like it's become something of an endless operation. It's not like it was a declared war, and it's not clear what the real goal is anymore. I mean, we went in because we thought Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks, but now it's just about trying to build democracy and maybe get some oil. It's a bit pointless, if you ask me.\n\nI get it, we want to help, but are we really making things better? It's like trying to build a house without a blueprint. Democracy can't just be built overnight. And if we leave, they'll just have to start all over again. Plus, it's so controversial, people are getting upset.\n\nI don't know, I guess I'm torn. I don't want to see all those families hurting because their loved ones are over there. But I also don't want to be a part of something that's just causing more problems. It's a tough call.\n\nWell, I guess that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a tough topic, isn't it?\"",
            "I'm not sure it's appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to pass a law declaring it legal. I believe it's more of a matter for churches to decide, as the Constitution itself states the principle of separation of church and state. It's clearly stated, and I think any attempt to impose rules on it would go against what's already written in stone. I think people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one religion's beliefs over others. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can or cannot make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of the Constitution that ensures religious tolerance. I don't think making an amendment about this issue would be right, as it would go against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal religious beliefs as a Catholic. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't a strong reason backing the amendment other than personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society without affecting the economy. I've said most of what I wanted to say.",
            "From the get-go, it's my belief that the U.S. government wasn't entirely truthful with the American public about the rationale behind invading Iraq. Before the 2003 invasion, there was a concerted effort to link the war with the September 11 attacks, despite the two events being largely disconnected. The government exploited the public's outrage over the terrorist attacks to fuel the invasion. Personally, I'm opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. In my view, the Iraq War is a reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from the past but instead, they found themselves in a familiar mess. Many American soldiers have lost their lives, and the government appeared ill-prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They tried to establish a democratic government, a task that proved far more challenging than anticipated. The U.S. government should have anticipated a prolonged struggle, similar to the one we faced in Vietnam, where we were fighting a guerrilla war against civilians. The U.S. has been there since 2003, and it's still a work in progress. The U.S. government didn't plan for the long haul, and the war has been billed as a quick success, which is naïve given the complexities involved. The war in Iraq is a complex issue, and it's not easy to decide whether to stay and finish what we started or to withdraw and risk abandoning the people we've displaced. The political and economic interests, including the control of oil resources, play a significant role in U.S. foreign policy decisions. We've seen that weapons of mass destruction weren't found in Iraq, yet we haven't targeted other nations with such weapons. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to the region, though it's not likely to be a swift resolution.",
            "Well, let's see, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. It's a matter of personal preference, and it's something that's been proven more and more to be biological rather than sociological. I believe it's inhumane to deny people rights over something they have no control over. I've always been an advocate for it. I don't think politics and government should have a role in this; it's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples, not married because they're not allowed to be. But they function the same way as any other family. With Bush trying to interpret marriage in his own way, I think it's ridiculous. I've read various reports saying it might be a chemical predisposition to be homosexual, not necessarily due to upbringing. Other than that, marriage is something that two people can do without anyone knowing if they're straight or gay. Why make it a public issue? It should be a private matter, not a federal one.",
            "Well, let me put it this way: when you post something online, you're essentially speaking into a microphone in a crowded room. It's not just that your words are out there for everyone to see, but you're also opening yourself up to scrutiny and interpretation. You can't have it both ways. If you talk about, say, explosives or gun violence, someone's going to pick up on it, and they might take it seriously, even if you don't. It's happened before. In our school, someone overheard a discussion and reported it to the authorities. When they found the source, they discovered they had posted some concerning stuff on Facebook. It was meant as a joke, but in that context, it became serious. The internet is a public forum, so you can't control what people see or how they react. If you don't want them to see it, don't put it out there. And sure, if you don't want your teachers or school officials to see it, don't add them as friends on social media. But if someone brings it to their attention, well, that's a different story. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger. It's their job to protect everyone. And I wouldn't friend my residents either because that's just crossing a line. It's not their place to monitor our Facebook and Myspace accounts. But if it's brought to their attention, that's on the person who shared it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone else is the one bringing it up. Just remember, if you put something out there, you can't control how it's perceived or who sees it.",
            "I feel like the war has been unnecessarily prolonged. Initially, the purpose was noble—restoring democracy in a country that lacked it. But we've since lost sight of that goal. I believe the original motivation was somewhat questionable, tied to the elder Bush's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. While providing democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant is a valid cause, we've lost our focus over time. The conflict has dragged on for years, and it seems we're now fighting to prove our dominance as a superpower. The money being spent could be better used to address our own issues, like poverty and infrastructure. It's become a drain on our economy, and we should allow the local government to handle things on their own.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone saw it online.\n\nOk, um...\n\nNo, I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. And if you have to be a member to see someone’s profile, you’re giving them permission to see it by accepting them as your friend.\n\nSo, any information you put on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um...\n\nThat’s tough because obviously you can’t have one person checking everyone’s profiles all day. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they’re only looking at the \"bad kids.\"\n\nUm, I don’t think it would be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But it all depends on the situation. Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nSure, I don’t have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I’ve seen something on TV about a man who easily got someone’s screen name and met with them in less than a minute.\n\nIt’s hard because you think they know your interests, your appearance, your schedule, your friends, and they can see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up, but I also want to communicate with my friends.\n\nSo, it’s a tricky issue because I only accept people I know.\n\nHum, uh...\n\nWell, I heard my roommate’s high school banned students from having Myspace. I don’t know how high school officials had the power to do that, or if that’s a privacy issue.

            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and one more point about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the chorus of those who claim they were against it from the beginning\nUm\nI was but, like, it’s not really important anymore\nBecause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, um\nYou just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, global polls\nAnd the bottom line is, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis,\nSeventy percent of the troops over there think it was a bad idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI mean, it’s been a complete disaster from the start\nIt was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between the United States and Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap\nAnd I don’t think any administration can understand it\nOr previous administrations\nAnd they think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nUm\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he wasn’t\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these are the people that we’re trying to save\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I definitely still see gender discrimination as a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; it also affects individuals in specific industries or fields due to societal expectations and biases.\n\nFor instance, in the business world, even though equality is theoretically supposed to exist, many people still struggle to work under a woman in a leadership position. This isn't just because of historical inequities; it's also due to deeply ingrained societal norms. Similarly, in the home, men who choose to stay at home as primary caregivers often face societal judgment and disapproval, despite the fact that their wives might be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are into fashion often face skepticism, particularly if they're straight. The assumption is that they might not understand what women want in fashion, leading to a general lack of trust in their abilities.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these issues exist, they're slowly changing. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being accepted in the business world. Men staying at home as fathers are also becoming more accepted, as society begins to realize that roles can be reversed based on individual circumstances.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote positive examples without being overly forceful. By showcasing the qualities and capabilities of those who are stereotyped or discriminated against, we can slowly shift societal perceptions. After all, change takes time, and we've already come a long way from the 1800s.",
            "So, the situation here is that they didn't make it legal, they just decriminalized it, which basically means it's not considered a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You know, when someone gets caught, they just get cited, rather than booked, arrested, and brought in. And, of course, there are still consequences for a marijuana charge, especially in terms of job interviews, but it's not as severe as a regular drug charge. The argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and house people, and it costs a lot to bring them to court and appoint public defenders. Plus, there are the financial benefits for the municipality, like being able to spend more on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Of course, there are also other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized, like the fact that if it were, it could be sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere, which could lead to people smoking and driving. Plus, it's still considered taboo in many places and contexts, and just the thought of it being out in the open might be awkward for some people. And, personally, I don't really know how I feel about it. I think in general, marijuana has more adverse effects on a person's lifestyle than alcohol does, but again, no two people react the same way. It's hard to generalize, but both substances have their own adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree\nYou see\nMany Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing things the same way for ages\nAnd that's important\nBut you also need to be adaptable to change\nYou know\nA lot of Catholics have strict rules about church attendance and how they're done\nSometimes it feels like the Church looks down on people who don't fully follow their teachings\nAnd they don't accept people of other religions either\nMy folks, for instance, were from different backgrounds\nMy mom was Catholic, but my dad was Episcopalian\nThey wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith\nThat's not really about loving others, is it?\nWe're taught to love others, but then the practice isn't always in line with that teaching\nIt's outdated, but they keep up with it\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop pedophilic behavior\nBecause it's different from having a spouse\nPedophiles likely wouldn't stop because they're married or not",
            "Um, I haven’t quite made up my mind on this issue yet. So, I can’t definitively say whether either side is right or wrong. But, I do believe this is one of the trickiest topics we’re dealing with today. It’s so close to the line between church and state, and figuring out how to define marriage without offending anyone is a real challenge. I don’t know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as a civil union, and not something the government should intervene with, for fear of offending religious sensibilities. After all, if people are married, they should be looked at as any other couple in a civil union. The whole idea of defining marriage is quite tricky, especially when it comes to something like same-sex marriage. If all states can come to a logical conclusion about it, then I think they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems ridiculous. It’s just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a gray area for me. I have many gay friends, and I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on its own. Many states are democratic, and they will likely push for gay marriage. If you're living in a democratic state, you should respect the decision of that state, as you've chosen to live there. Therefore, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals and that each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage on their own. I don't think President Bush should impose a national ban on gay marriage; it should be up to each individual state. I just don't think he can decide for the entire country, as he doesn't live in every state. Plus, he'll be out of office soon. A change in the presidency might just bring about a different policy. So, it should be up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision.",
            "Some people are under the impression that they can share personal information on the internet without consequence. But let's break this down. A social networking site like Myspace, by definition, is intended for public viewing. If you post something on the web, you're doing so with the understanding that others, including school officials, can see it. Whether it's under the school's name or not, they can access it through their homes. Now, I'm not saying that school officials should use the internet to snoop on students. That's an invasion of privacy. But if the information they find could prevent a school shooting or make the school a safer place, then I believe they have every right to monitor it. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe environment when they're dropped off at school. And the school system has a responsibility to ensure that. We practice lock downs and drills to prepare for emergencies, including school shootings. So, if school officials find information that could help prevent such tragedies, it's not an invasion of privacy; it's them doing their job to keep students safe.",
            "I was initially all for the war. I was deeply affected by 9/11 and wanted to strike back. However, in hindsight, I think we overlooked many factors and rushed into the conflict without a clear plan. I now believe that it backfired on us. Initially, I was all for it, but my perspective has since shifted. I don't think our presence in the region is making any difference. They are too busy fighting amongst themselves to fight against us. I think we should just leave. I don't think we were prepared for what we found there, and the concept of war is different for them than it is for us. They don't seem interested in improving their country, only in getting us to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion than logic. We went in seeking revenge, and President Bush acted based on public sentiment. We had to declare war, but we could have done so with a better plan. I don't think we made enough progress to warrant staying. The longer we stay, the more it seems like it will collapse once we leave. I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying. I don't think we can change those people, and it's time to admit that our efforts haven't been successful."
