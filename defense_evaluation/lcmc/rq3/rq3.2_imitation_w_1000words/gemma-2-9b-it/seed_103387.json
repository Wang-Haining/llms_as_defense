            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize its views in a few ways. They've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of many things.  For example, they have strong opinions on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are fine, but those views seem a bit outdated. If they were more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't worry about losing people. I've heard that some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues. They feel the Church is wrong on certain subjects.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that teaches it's completely wrong. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to be part of a church that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  It's hard to say if those changes would have prevented the recent scandals, though. Maybe they would have, maybe not.  \n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have both a job and a family.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I think it's wrong to judge someone for who they love.  Whether someone is born that way or it develops over time, it's not a choice they make, so they shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nHonestly, I haven't really thought about it too much, but it feels wrong to me.  It's like being born straight versus being born gay – you don't choose either one.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue, and I don't know if it's even a moral issue. It just feels like the government shouldn't be telling people who they can and can't love.  \n\nIt's not like gay people are doing something wrong or making a bad choice. They are who they are, and they shouldn't be treated any differently.",
            "So, I really think gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, I don't see a good reason against it. Some folks worry that gay couples are a threat to traditional families, but that just doesn't make sense to me. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're both fruits, but totally different. \n\nPlus, there are tons of important civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick, because they're not legally recognized as family.  Seems unfair, right?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's all about love and commitment.  \n\nWhat really gets me is that people think gay couples are asking for special treatment. They're not trying to get married in a church; they just want the legal recognition and protections that come with a marriage certificate. If the government's not involved in church matters, why should religion dictate who can and can't get married?\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. \n\nAnd let's talk about adoption and kids. Some folks worry about how gay parents will raise their kids, but honestly, good parenting comes down to love and support, not sexual orientation. \n\nThe truth is, some kids of gay parents face bullying and discrimination. It's heartbreaking.  \n\nI think the federal government needs to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. We need to treat everyone equally. We can't let religious beliefs dictate the law and deny people their basic rights.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it makes me think about this whole marijuana thing. Just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. I mean, there are tons of drugs we use in pharmacies that are illegal for the general public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet, you know? Those are all controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have medical benefits.  It feels wrong to say marijuana is totally off-limits just because it has a bad reputation.\n\nI get that some people worry about marijuana being abused, just like alcohol.  But honestly, I think we need to ditch the whole \"marijuana is the devil\" image. It's not as harmful as heroin or cocaine. If we stopped seeing it as this scary, dangerous drug, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\n\nMaybe we should try legalizing it gradually, not all at once. That way, we can make sure people are using it safely.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. But now, as I've gotten older, they've created a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the beach, or families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other changes, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. That's the church I know. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but that's just my experience. \n\nAbout those accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests marry would have stopped them. There are married men who become pedophiles too, and they still have attractions to young children.  I think it's about the individual, not whether or not they're allowed to get married. Becoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions where priests can be married. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they should maybe consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. I don't think people just become that way. It's something they're born with. It might have something to do with upbringing in some cases, but I think genetics play a big role. You can't hide that with marriage. You may try, but it usually comes out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, then shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Honestly, I'm still bothered by the whole Iraq War thing. Sure, at first, I kinda understood it, everyone was on edge after 9/11, but I think we rushed into it for the wrong reasons. The Bush administration kept saying it was all about Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction, but we later found out that was a bunch of lies. That really rubs me the wrong way.  It feels like they straight-up lied to the American people, and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has since said he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then.  That's just wrong, in my opinion. It's like they don't care about the Constitution or anything. \n\nI get the feeling they wanted to go to war from the start. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book after he was basically pushed out of his job? He said the younger Bush came in wanting revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened with his dad. Plus, I think they were hoping to secure our energy supply, which is pretty shady.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably cause chaos with a civil war breaking out and even more people dying. But bringing in other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help out? That doesn't seem like a good solution either. It's going to mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and honestly, I don't think their government is working anyway. The Parliament seems useless, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any power. And don't even get me started on that extremist group, the one we were fighting not too long ago. They're now in Parliament with a bunch of seats. It's all so complicated, and I don't have all the answers.",
            "I'm not sure exactly how I feel about the war in Iraq.  It feels pointless, like it was just a way for us to get back at them for 9/11. I don't really follow the news about it, so I don't know all the details.  But my understanding is we're trying to build democracy there, kind of like making it another part of the US, and also to get access to their oil. But staying there just makes everyone upset.  \n\nBuilding a democracy takes a long time, and if we leave they'll be angry because they feel like we messed things up and abandoned them.  It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, this whole thing is really complicated. I don't know if it's right to keep sending our troops there, even though it's important to help those people. It feels like we're wasting our resources, and it's making President Bush look bad. We're starting to sound like we're just trying to show off our strength and power, like the Vietnam War.  \n\nI also think about the families of the soldiers who are in Iraq. I want them to come home safely, but I also worry about the people of Iraq and the impact of our presence on their lives and culture. \n\nWhat if we're just making things worse by trying to force our ideas on them? Maybe it's best to leave and let them find their own way, even if it's painful. This whole war seems like it's going to drag on for years and years. I just don't know what the right answer is.",
            "I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be going against what's already been written in stone. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another, because most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some areas like Boston. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they're thinking about making an amendment, I think it would be wrong and go against what's already been established. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason for an amendment banning it, other than personal views. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or anything else. It might even be positive for society.",
            "Ok, so the war in Iraq. To be honest, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about the reasons we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, but really, the two weren't that connected.  But the government played on people's emotions after 9/11,  and that's how the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. And I think this war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War. We should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's horrible. I think the government wasn't prepared for the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government. They weren't ready for the power vacuum and the unrest.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – we tried to push out Communism and install democracy, and it was a long, hard struggle. We should have known it wouldn't be a quick victory. In Vietnam, no matter how many people supported us, there were always insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people.\n\nSo, first, I think we shouldn't have gone to war at all. But if we're going to, we need to plan for everything. I don't think the government was prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. We're trying to train the Iraqi police and army, but it's a slow process.\n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, successful mission. But it takes years to build a new government.  Look at our own country – democracy took a long time to develop.  It wasn't easy.\n\n\nI think the government made it seem like it would be easy to change Iraq. \n\nIt's hard because we've been there so long. How can we just abandon them now after taking their government and way of life? But we also have to consider the cost in American lives. How many is too many?  \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is why Iraq? Why not other countries? I think it's all about oil. That's where our resources are. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. But we know North Korea has them, and we're not doing anything about it. I don't think the government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace. But I'm not sure that'll happen.",
            "Okay, so, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I really think it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it might even be biological, not just something about how you were raised.  So, to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control just seems wrong to me.  It feels kind of inhumane.  I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal thing, something that affects families and individuals, not the state. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though - walking their dogs, hanging out, you know? \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to define marriage in his own way. It's like he's playing God. \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be linked to something in your brain, like a biological predisposition. It's not about growing up with certain siblings or a lack of a father figure, it's more about something you're born with.\n\nBesides the obvious reason, it's just that marriage is something a guy and a girl can do secretly if they want to. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, like front-page news. It should be a private matter, not something the whole country is involved in.",
            "Okay, so basically, when you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's public knowledge.  As a resident advisor, I've actually dealt with this before.  \n\nWhat you post online can definitely shape how people perceive you. If you're talking about violence, like blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that out into the world. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on MySpace, you get their updates. The school wouldn't have gotten a bulletin directly; someone went to the school with this information. They had to act on it because they can't just ignore it, especially after something like 9/11.  You don't want them to be unprepared if something were to happen.\n\nHowever, it's tough to know what to take seriously because some people might just be joking around. Maybe it was a social experiment gone wrong for a class, or maybe it was something really serious.  \n\nIn one situation at our school, someone overheard a conversation and reported it. When they finally found the person, they looked through his Facebook and found some things that seemed harmless but became concerning given the situation.\n\nThe point is, once you put something online, there's no real privacy anymore. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. If you don't want people to see it or interpret it a certain way, you can't control that.\nSchools shouldn't be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.  They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if it's brought to their attention, that's a different story.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for way too long. Sure, the initial goal of spreading democracy to a country lacking it seemed good at the start. But, honestly, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove how powerful we are. I also wonder about the motives behind the war in the first place. There were those old conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, so maybe that played a part.  I mean, if the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country under a terrible leader, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But if personal grudges were involved, then that wouldn't be right. \n\nRegardless, the war has gone on for far too long. We made our point in those first few months when we launched the invasion. It was a powerful statement.  But it's been years now, and I think it's time to end it.  Maybe we were right to start the war, but I don't think our reasons have stayed clear. It feels like we're stuck in a never-ending conflict, just trying to win at all costs. \n\nIt's just not right to keep fighting this war forever. These people need to learn to govern themselves eventually, and that time is now. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while we have so many problems here at home. Poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—these are things that need our attention and resources. It's a huge drain on our economy, and it's happening for a cause that we've long since lost sight of.  \n\nWe need to stop spending billions on war and start investing in our own country. There are so many pressing issues that need our attention, and this war is just dragging us down.",
            "So, I'm curious about this situation. Was it stopped because someone stumbled upon information online?  Okay, so I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. Sure, you need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it when you add them as a friend.  Honestly, anything you put online should be seen as public knowledge. So, I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough though because you can't have someone constantly watching everyone's profiles to prevent problems. It would be discriminatory to target \"bad kids\" and focus on them. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to constantly monitor people's online activity. It depends on the situation though. Were they randomly looking at profiles, or were they specifically searching for evidence of something? I just don't know.\n\nI don't have Myspace personally, but I do have Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see all sorts of things about me. I saw a news story about a guy who easily found a girl's screen name and started IMing her, arranging to meet her within minutes. Obviously, I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes message me on IM who I don't recognize. They know my interests, what I look like, and even my class schedule. They know a lot about you from your profile. I try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I want to connect with friends. It's a tough balance.  You have to be careful who you let see your stuff.\n\nMy roommate told me about her high school banning Myspace. I didn't understand how they had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It felt a bit strange to me.",
            "I feel kinda hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who say they were always against it.  I mean, it's pretty obvious now that it was a bad idea, except for the people in charge who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls.  Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the rest of the world, people think it was a mistake.  Even most of the US troops over there think it was a bad idea and want us to leave. \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from the start.  Even before we invaded, things were bad, and now getting out is just going to be another disaster.  \n\nIt all comes down to the clash between American culture and the Middle East. The gap is just too big.  Our leaders think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly. It's like quicksand - once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay there.  The administration probably has some ideas, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually over a year or so, I guess I could understand that.  But I just don't see why we can't leave now.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone this year, and a quarter want us to leave immediately.  They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know best.\n\nAt least if we ask them and they say yes, it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say we were willing to stay, but they chose to leave.  \n\nIt won't make us heroes, but it's better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in. For example, women still face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposed to be a reality, they often find it hard to get promoted to higher positions. Men might be less likely to work under a woman because of how society has always been. \n\nSo, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not choose her simply because historically, women haven't been in leadership roles in business. It's the same for men, though. Like in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, there are expectations based on gender.\n\nIt's uncommon for a male to stay at home while his wife works, and people sometimes judge them for it. Society thinks the man should be the breadwinner, even if it's not what works best for the family.\n\nAnd in the fashion industry, straight men sometimes get dismissed as not being serious about fashion because society stereotypes men in the industry as having a certain lifestyle. People might wonder if they really understand fashion if they don't fit that stereotype.\n\nBasically, depending on the field, there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has these ingrained ideas. We've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow.\n\nThe good news is that things are slowly getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in business. More stay-at-home dads are accepted because people see that it works for some families. And maybe people in fashion are starting to realize that men can have valid opinions about fashion too.\n\nI think the key is to keep promoting the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. We can't force change, but if we highlight the strengths of those who are often overlooked, it will help shift attitudes.  We've already come so far, and with time, things will continue to improve.",
            "So, they didn't actually make marijuana legal.  They decriminalized it, meaning it's no longer a criminal offense.  Think of it like a traffic ticket instead of a serious arrest. You get cited, but you don't get booked or thrown in jail.\n\nNow, even though it's decriminalized, there are still worries about the long-term effects on things like job interviews. Those are the scary parts of a drug charge that don't disappear just because it's not a criminal offense anymore.\n\nBut, there's a financial aspect too. Arresting, booking, and processing people for marijuana offenses is incredibly expensive. There are court costs, public defenders, and state attorney fees. It all adds up!\n\nFor towns struggling financially, that cost is a big deal. Some places are just against marijuana, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize it. Maybe they can use that saved money on schools, social programs, or helping the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana openly sold everywhere, like cigarettes.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it's still considered taboo in many situations.\n\nAs for the effects, alcohol probably messes with your motor skills more, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. They both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things in moderation, while others struggle.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of Catholic traditions are very old and they've been practiced for a long time.  It's good to have those traditions, but it's also important to be open to change.  A lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week and there are strict rules about how things are done. Sometimes, it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules exactly and doesn't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics or people of other religions.  For example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths.  We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic belief, but it feels hypocritical to say that and then not accept people in that way.\n\nIt seems like Catholic teachings encourage certain things, but the way things are actually practiced often goes against those teachings because they're so old-fashioned. They just stick with them anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests who are abusive. It's a different problem. It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\nIt's hard to say, but I think people who abuse children would probably still do it even if they were married. It's about the power dynamic and the abuse itself, not about whether or not someone is married.  I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent this kind of abuse. It would probably still happen.",
            "Okay, so I'm still figuring this whole thing out. I haven't decided where I stand on this issue yet. It's really tough to say if either side is right or wrong because it's such a complicated topic. It's right on the edge of separation of church and state, and figuring out what marriage really means is super tricky without upsetting anyone. I don't know, but I think maybe civil unions are the way to go. It makes me wonder if the government should even be defining marriage, especially since it's considered a sacred thing by some. After all, the government doesn't give tax breaks or special treatment to people just because they were baptized, right? So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together. It's about their commitment to each other, not about the government getting involved in their religious beliefs.\n\nAnd about gay marriage... I think it gets complicated because it ties into all this stuff about separation of church and state. If it's a civil union, it should be treated the same as any other, regardless of who's involved.\n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That seems totally overboard. It just feels wrong to change the Constitution just for this.  It's a big deal for some people, but is it really big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment? I don't think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I have lots of gay friends, but I'm not sure I personally agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal.  I don't think it's something the whole country should be arguing about. I feel like each state should decide for themselves instead of leaving it up to the president.\n\nYou see, some states are more liberal, and others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it makes sense that you'd accept their stance on the issue. Choosing to live in a certain state means accepting their values, right?\n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, for that reason, I think gay marriage should be legal, but it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI don't think the president should be able to make that call for the whole country. It's not fair for him to impose his views on everyone.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each one is run.  Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway!  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just create more back-and-forth. It's much simpler if each state makes its own choice – they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.",
            "So, I don't think it's a big deal that school officials checked out what students posted on Myspace. I mean, Myspace is public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see.  If you put something on there, you have to realize that people will see it, even if it's not your parents or friends. That includes school officials, even if they're not looking at it under the school's name. They could easily see it from their own homes.  \n\nLook, preventing school shootings is super important. Keeping students safe is a big responsibility for schools, and if looking at Myspace helps them do that, then I'm okay with it.  \n\nNow, I get that it can feel like an invasion of privacy if teachers are constantly checking Myspace just to catch kids doing something wrong. Like, if they're digging through profiles looking for evidence of drinking or smoking, that's different. But if they have a reason to believe something is wrong and they use Myspace to investigate, I think that's fair.  \n\nThink about it: If you post something online, even an email, you have to be careful because it can come back to haunt you later. Everything you put out there stays out there forever.  \n\nIt's like a teacher told me - they have to do these things to keep the school safe. They have to be prepared for anything, just like they practice lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. It's all about making sure everyone stays safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted payback, you know? I thought going over there and causing as much trouble as they did here was the right thing to do. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We rushed into it unprepared, without a real plan. It feels like everything backfired. \n\nHonestly, I was all for it at the time, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. I feel like as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they won't be focusing on us.  \n\nBeing over there isn't helping; it just seems like a pointless mess. Because of 9/11, I just don't care about what happens over there anymore. It's hard to even think of those people as human, the way they fight and can't seem to get along.\n\nWe went in there totally blind; we didn't know what we were facing.  Their idea of war is so different from ours. They're savage, and I don't think they want to build a better country; they just want us out.\n\nMaybe we should just leave. I think we were more hyped up than rational. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change everything. It felt like we were looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it after 9/11.\n\nI get where he was coming from, though. After what happened, we couldn't just ignore it. But I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear about what we were trying to achieve, and there was no unity. We didn't know what we were getting into.\n\nIt seems like everything was driven by emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. I think they'll always be like that. I don't know what else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but it's not enough to justify staying. I think no matter how long we're there, it'll collapse when we leave. We can't stay forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize its views in a few ways. They've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of many things.  For example, they have strong opinions on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are fine, but those views seem a bit outdated. If they were more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't worry about losing people. I've heard that some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues. They feel the Church is wrong on certain subjects.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that teaches it's completely wrong. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to be part of a church that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  It's hard to say if those changes would have prevented the recent scandals, though. Maybe they would have, maybe not.  \n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have both a job and a family.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I think it's wrong to judge someone for who they love.  Whether someone is born that way or it develops over time, it's not a choice they make, so they shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nHonestly, I haven't really thought about it too much, but it feels wrong to me.  It's like being born straight versus being born gay – you don't choose either one.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue, and I don't know if it's even a moral issue. It just feels like the government shouldn't be telling people who they can and can't love.  \n\nIt's not like gay people are doing something wrong or making a bad choice. They are who they are, and they shouldn't be treated any differently.",
            "So, I really think gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, I don't see a good reason against it. Some folks worry that gay couples are a threat to traditional families, but that just doesn't make sense to me. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're both fruits, but totally different. \n\nPlus, there are tons of important civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick, because they're not legally recognized as family.  Seems unfair, right?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's all about love and commitment.  \n\nWhat really gets me is that people think gay couples are asking for special treatment. They're not trying to get married in a church; they just want the legal recognition and protections that come with a marriage certificate. If the government's not involved in church matters, why should religion dictate who can and can't get married?\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. \n\nAnd let's talk about adoption and kids. Some folks worry about how gay parents will raise their kids, but honestly, good parenting comes down to love and support, not sexual orientation. \n\nThe truth is, some kids of gay parents face bullying and discrimination. It's heartbreaking.  \n\nI think the federal government needs to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. We need to treat everyone equally. We can't let religious beliefs dictate the law and deny people their basic rights.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it makes me think about this whole marijuana thing. Just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. I mean, there are tons of drugs we use in pharmacies that are illegal for the general public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet, you know? Those are all controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have medical benefits.  It feels wrong to say marijuana is totally off-limits just because it has a bad reputation.\n\nI get that some people worry about marijuana being abused, just like alcohol.  But honestly, I think we need to ditch the whole \"marijuana is the devil\" image. It's not as harmful as heroin or cocaine. If we stopped seeing it as this scary, dangerous drug, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\n\nMaybe we should try legalizing it gradually, not all at once. That way, we can make sure people are using it safely.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. But now, as I've gotten older, they've created a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the beach, or families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other changes, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. That's the church I know. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but that's just my experience. \n\nAbout those accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests marry would have stopped them. There are married men who become pedophiles too, and they still have attractions to young children.  I think it's about the individual, not whether or not they're allowed to get married. Becoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions where priests can be married. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they should maybe consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. I don't think people just become that way. It's something they're born with. It might have something to do with upbringing in some cases, but I think genetics play a big role. You can't hide that with marriage. You may try, but it usually comes out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, then shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Honestly, I'm still bothered by the whole Iraq War thing. Sure, at first, I kinda understood it, everyone was on edge after 9/11, but I think we rushed into it for the wrong reasons. The Bush administration kept saying it was all about Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction, but we later found out that was a bunch of lies. That really rubs me the wrong way.  It feels like they straight-up lied to the American people, and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has since said he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then.  That's just wrong, in my opinion. It's like they don't care about the Constitution or anything. \n\nI get the feeling they wanted to go to war from the start. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book after he was basically pushed out of his job? He said the younger Bush came in wanting revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened with his dad. Plus, I think they were hoping to secure our energy supply, which is pretty shady.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably cause chaos with a civil war breaking out and even more people dying. But bringing in other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help out? That doesn't seem like a good solution either. It's going to mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and honestly, I don't think their government is working anyway. The Parliament seems useless, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any power. And don't even get me started on that extremist group, the one we were fighting not too long ago. They're now in Parliament with a bunch of seats. It's all so complicated, and I don't have all the answers.",
            "I'm not sure exactly how I feel about the war in Iraq.  It feels pointless, like it was just a way for us to get back at them for 9/11. I don't really follow the news about it, so I don't know all the details.  But my understanding is we're trying to build democracy there, kind of like making it another part of the US, and also to get access to their oil. But staying there just makes everyone upset.  \n\nBuilding a democracy takes a long time, and if we leave they'll be angry because they feel like we messed things up and abandoned them.  It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, this whole thing is really complicated. I don't know if it's right to keep sending our troops there, even though it's important to help those people. It feels like we're wasting our resources, and it's making President Bush look bad. We're starting to sound like we're just trying to show off our strength and power, like the Vietnam War.  \n\nI also think about the families of the soldiers who are in Iraq. I want them to come home safely, but I also worry about the people of Iraq and the impact of our presence on their lives and culture. \n\nWhat if we're just making things worse by trying to force our ideas on them? Maybe it's best to leave and let them find their own way, even if it's painful. This whole war seems like it's going to drag on for years and years. I just don't know what the right answer is.",
            "I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be going against what's already been written in stone. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another, because most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some areas like Boston. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they're thinking about making an amendment, I think it would be wrong and go against what's already been established. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason for an amendment banning it, other than personal views. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or anything else. It might even be positive for society.",
            "Ok, so the war in Iraq. To be honest, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about the reasons we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, but really, the two weren't that connected.  But the government played on people's emotions after 9/11,  and that's how the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. And I think this war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War. We should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's horrible. I think the government wasn't prepared for the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government. They weren't ready for the power vacuum and the unrest.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – we tried to push out Communism and install democracy, and it was a long, hard struggle. We should have known it wouldn't be a quick victory. In Vietnam, no matter how many people supported us, there were always insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people.\n\nSo, first, I think we shouldn't have gone to war at all. But if we're going to, we need to plan for everything. I don't think the government was prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. We're trying to train the Iraqi police and army, but it's a slow process.\n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, successful mission. But it takes years to build a new government.  Look at our own country – democracy took a long time to develop.  It wasn't easy.\n\n\nI think the government made it seem like it would be easy to change Iraq. \n\nIt's hard because we've been there so long. How can we just abandon them now after taking their government and way of life? But we also have to consider the cost in American lives. How many is too many?  \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is why Iraq? Why not other countries? I think it's all about oil. That's where our resources are. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. But we know North Korea has them, and we're not doing anything about it. I don't think the government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace. But I'm not sure that'll happen.",
            "Okay, so, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I really think it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it might even be biological, not just something about how you were raised.  So, to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control just seems wrong to me.  It feels kind of inhumane.  I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal thing, something that affects families and individuals, not the state. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though - walking their dogs, hanging out, you know? \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to define marriage in his own way. It's like he's playing God. \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be linked to something in your brain, like a biological predisposition. It's not about growing up with certain siblings or a lack of a father figure, it's more about something you're born with.\n\nBesides the obvious reason, it's just that marriage is something a guy and a girl can do secretly if they want to. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, like front-page news. It should be a private matter, not something the whole country is involved in.",
            "Okay, so basically, when you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's public knowledge.  As a resident advisor, I've actually dealt with this before.  \n\nWhat you post online can definitely shape how people perceive you. If you're talking about violence, like blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that out into the world. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on MySpace, you get their updates. The school wouldn't have gotten a bulletin directly; someone went to the school with this information. They had to act on it because they can't just ignore it, especially after something like 9/11.  You don't want them to be unprepared if something were to happen.\n\nHowever, it's tough to know what to take seriously because some people might just be joking around. Maybe it was a social experiment gone wrong for a class, or maybe it was something really serious.  \n\nIn one situation at our school, someone overheard a conversation and reported it. When they finally found the person, they looked through his Facebook and found some things that seemed harmless but became concerning given the situation.\n\nThe point is, once you put something online, there's no real privacy anymore. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. If you don't want people to see it or interpret it a certain way, you can't control that.\nSchools shouldn't be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.  They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if it's brought to their attention, that's a different story.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for way too long. Sure, the initial goal of spreading democracy to a country lacking it seemed good at the start. But, honestly, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove how powerful we are. I also wonder about the motives behind the war in the first place. There were those old conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, so maybe that played a part.  I mean, if the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country under a terrible leader, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But if personal grudges were involved, then that wouldn't be right. \n\nRegardless, the war has gone on for far too long. We made our point in those first few months when we launched the invasion. It was a powerful statement.  But it's been years now, and I think it's time to end it.  Maybe we were right to start the war, but I don't think our reasons have stayed clear. It feels like we're stuck in a never-ending conflict, just trying to win at all costs. \n\nIt's just not right to keep fighting this war forever. These people need to learn to govern themselves eventually, and that time is now. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while we have so many problems here at home. Poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—these are things that need our attention and resources. It's a huge drain on our economy, and it's happening for a cause that we've long since lost sight of.  \n\nWe need to stop spending billions on war and start investing in our own country. There are so many pressing issues that need our attention, and this war is just dragging us down.",
            "So, I'm curious about this situation. Was it stopped because someone stumbled upon information online?  Okay, so I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. Sure, you need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it when you add them as a friend.  Honestly, anything you put online should be seen as public knowledge. So, I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough though because you can't have someone constantly watching everyone's profiles to prevent problems. It would be discriminatory to target \"bad kids\" and focus on them. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to constantly monitor people's online activity. It depends on the situation though. Were they randomly looking at profiles, or were they specifically searching for evidence of something? I just don't know.\n\nI don't have Myspace personally, but I do have Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see all sorts of things about me. I saw a news story about a guy who easily found a girl's screen name and started IMing her, arranging to meet her within minutes. Obviously, I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes message me on IM who I don't recognize. They know my interests, what I look like, and even my class schedule. They know a lot about you from your profile. I try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I want to connect with friends. It's a tough balance.  You have to be careful who you let see your stuff.\n\nMy roommate told me about her high school banning Myspace. I didn't understand how they had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It felt a bit strange to me.",
            "I feel kinda hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who say they were always against it.  I mean, it's pretty obvious now that it was a bad idea, except for the people in charge who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls.  Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the rest of the world, people think it was a mistake.  Even most of the US troops over there think it was a bad idea and want us to leave. \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from the start.  Even before we invaded, things were bad, and now getting out is just going to be another disaster.  \n\nIt all comes down to the clash between American culture and the Middle East. The gap is just too big.  Our leaders think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly. It's like quicksand - once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay there.  The administration probably has some ideas, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually over a year or so, I guess I could understand that.  But I just don't see why we can't leave now.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone this year, and a quarter want us to leave immediately.  They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know best.\n\nAt least if we ask them and they say yes, it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say we were willing to stay, but they chose to leave.  \n\nIt won't make us heroes, but it's better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in. For example, women still face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposed to be a reality, they often find it hard to get promoted to higher positions. Men might be less likely to work under a woman because of how society has always been. \n\nSo, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not choose her simply because historically, women haven't been in leadership roles in business. It's the same for men, though. Like in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, there are expectations based on gender.\n\nIt's uncommon for a male to stay at home while his wife works, and people sometimes judge them for it. Society thinks the man should be the breadwinner, even if it's not what works best for the family.\n\nAnd in the fashion industry, straight men sometimes get dismissed as not being serious about fashion because society stereotypes men in the industry as having a certain lifestyle. People might wonder if they really understand fashion if they don't fit that stereotype.\n\nBasically, depending on the field, there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has these ingrained ideas. We've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow.\n\nThe good news is that things are slowly getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in business. More stay-at-home dads are accepted because people see that it works for some families. And maybe people in fashion are starting to realize that men can have valid opinions about fashion too.\n\nI think the key is to keep promoting the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. We can't force change, but if we highlight the strengths of those who are often overlooked, it will help shift attitudes.  We've already come so far, and with time, things will continue to improve.",
            "So, they didn't actually make marijuana legal.  They decriminalized it, meaning it's no longer a criminal offense.  Think of it like a traffic ticket instead of a serious arrest. You get cited, but you don't get booked or thrown in jail.\n\nNow, even though it's decriminalized, there are still worries about the long-term effects on things like job interviews. Those are the scary parts of a drug charge that don't disappear just because it's not a criminal offense anymore.\n\nBut, there's a financial aspect too. Arresting, booking, and processing people for marijuana offenses is incredibly expensive. There are court costs, public defenders, and state attorney fees. It all adds up!\n\nFor towns struggling financially, that cost is a big deal. Some places are just against marijuana, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize it. Maybe they can use that saved money on schools, social programs, or helping the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana openly sold everywhere, like cigarettes.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it's still considered taboo in many situations.\n\nAs for the effects, alcohol probably messes with your motor skills more, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. They both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things in moderation, while others struggle.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of Catholic traditions are very old and they've been practiced for a long time.  It's good to have those traditions, but it's also important to be open to change.  A lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week and there are strict rules about how things are done. Sometimes, it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules exactly and doesn't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics or people of other religions.  For example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths.  We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic belief, but it feels hypocritical to say that and then not accept people in that way.\n\nIt seems like Catholic teachings encourage certain things, but the way things are actually practiced often goes against those teachings because they're so old-fashioned. They just stick with them anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests who are abusive. It's a different problem. It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\nIt's hard to say, but I think people who abuse children would probably still do it even if they were married. It's about the power dynamic and the abuse itself, not about whether or not someone is married.  I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent this kind of abuse. It would probably still happen.",
            "Okay, so I'm still figuring this whole thing out. I haven't decided where I stand on this issue yet. It's really tough to say if either side is right or wrong because it's such a complicated topic. It's right on the edge of separation of church and state, and figuring out what marriage really means is super tricky without upsetting anyone. I don't know, but I think maybe civil unions are the way to go. It makes me wonder if the government should even be defining marriage, especially since it's considered a sacred thing by some. After all, the government doesn't give tax breaks or special treatment to people just because they were baptized, right? So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together. It's about their commitment to each other, not about the government getting involved in their religious beliefs.\n\nAnd about gay marriage... I think it gets complicated because it ties into all this stuff about separation of church and state. If it's a civil union, it should be treated the same as any other, regardless of who's involved.\n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That seems totally overboard. It just feels wrong to change the Constitution just for this.  It's a big deal for some people, but is it really big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment? I don't think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I have lots of gay friends, but I'm not sure I personally agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal.  I don't think it's something the whole country should be arguing about. I feel like each state should decide for themselves instead of leaving it up to the president.\n\nYou see, some states are more liberal, and others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it makes sense that you'd accept their stance on the issue. Choosing to live in a certain state means accepting their values, right?\n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, for that reason, I think gay marriage should be legal, but it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI don't think the president should be able to make that call for the whole country. It's not fair for him to impose his views on everyone.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each one is run.  Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway!  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just create more back-and-forth. It's much simpler if each state makes its own choice – they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.",
            "So, I don't think it's a big deal that school officials checked out what students posted on Myspace. I mean, Myspace is public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see.  If you put something on there, you have to realize that people will see it, even if it's not your parents or friends. That includes school officials, even if they're not looking at it under the school's name. They could easily see it from their own homes.  \n\nLook, preventing school shootings is super important. Keeping students safe is a big responsibility for schools, and if looking at Myspace helps them do that, then I'm okay with it.  \n\nNow, I get that it can feel like an invasion of privacy if teachers are constantly checking Myspace just to catch kids doing something wrong. Like, if they're digging through profiles looking for evidence of drinking or smoking, that's different. But if they have a reason to believe something is wrong and they use Myspace to investigate, I think that's fair.  \n\nThink about it: If you post something online, even an email, you have to be careful because it can come back to haunt you later. Everything you put out there stays out there forever.  \n\nIt's like a teacher told me - they have to do these things to keep the school safe. They have to be prepared for anything, just like they practice lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. It's all about making sure everyone stays safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted payback, you know? I thought going over there and causing as much trouble as they did here was the right thing to do. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We rushed into it unprepared, without a real plan. It feels like everything backfired. \n\nHonestly, I was all for it at the time, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. I feel like as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they won't be focusing on us.  \n\nBeing over there isn't helping; it just seems like a pointless mess. Because of 9/11, I just don't care about what happens over there anymore. It's hard to even think of those people as human, the way they fight and can't seem to get along.\n\nWe went in there totally blind; we didn't know what we were facing.  Their idea of war is so different from ours. They're savage, and I don't think they want to build a better country; they just want us out.\n\nMaybe we should just leave. I think we were more hyped up than rational. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change everything. It felt like we were looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it after 9/11.\n\nI get where he was coming from, though. After what happened, we couldn't just ignore it. But I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear about what we were trying to achieve, and there was no unity. We didn't know what we were getting into.\n\nIt seems like everything was driven by emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. I think they'll always be like that. I don't know what else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but it's not enough to justify staying. I think no matter how long we're there, it'll collapse when we leave. We can't stay forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize its views in a few ways. They've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of many things.  For example, they have strong opinions on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are fine, but those views seem a bit outdated. If they were more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't worry about losing people. I've heard that some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues. They feel the Church is wrong on certain subjects.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that teaches it's completely wrong. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to be part of a church that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  It's hard to say if those changes would have prevented the recent scandals, though. Maybe they would have, maybe not.  \n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have both a job and a family.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I think it's wrong to judge someone for who they love.  Whether someone is born that way or it develops over time, it's not a choice they make, so they shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nHonestly, I haven't really thought about it too much, but it feels wrong to me.  It's like being born straight versus being born gay – you don't choose either one.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue, and I don't know if it's even a moral issue. It just feels like the government shouldn't be telling people who they can and can't love.  \n\nIt's not like gay people are doing something wrong or making a bad choice. They are who they are, and they shouldn't be treated any differently.",
            "So, I really think gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, I don't see a good reason against it. Some folks worry that gay couples are a threat to traditional families, but that just doesn't make sense to me. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're both fruits, but totally different. \n\nPlus, there are tons of important civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick, because they're not legally recognized as family.  Seems unfair, right?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's all about love and commitment.  \n\nWhat really gets me is that people think gay couples are asking for special treatment. They're not trying to get married in a church; they just want the legal recognition and protections that come with a marriage certificate. If the government's not involved in church matters, why should religion dictate who can and can't get married?\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. \n\nAnd let's talk about adoption and kids. Some folks worry about how gay parents will raise their kids, but honestly, good parenting comes down to love and support, not sexual orientation. \n\nThe truth is, some kids of gay parents face bullying and discrimination. It's heartbreaking.  \n\nI think the federal government needs to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. We need to treat everyone equally. We can't let religious beliefs dictate the law and deny people their basic rights.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it makes me think about this whole marijuana thing. Just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. I mean, there are tons of drugs we use in pharmacies that are illegal for the general public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet, you know? Those are all controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have medical benefits.  It feels wrong to say marijuana is totally off-limits just because it has a bad reputation.\n\nI get that some people worry about marijuana being abused, just like alcohol.  But honestly, I think we need to ditch the whole \"marijuana is the devil\" image. It's not as harmful as heroin or cocaine. If we stopped seeing it as this scary, dangerous drug, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\n\nMaybe we should try legalizing it gradually, not all at once. That way, we can make sure people are using it safely.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. But now, as I've gotten older, they've created a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the beach, or families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other changes, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. That's the church I know. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but that's just my experience. \n\nAbout those accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests marry would have stopped them. There are married men who become pedophiles too, and they still have attractions to young children.  I think it's about the individual, not whether or not they're allowed to get married. Becoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions where priests can be married. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they should maybe consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. I don't think people just become that way. It's something they're born with. It might have something to do with upbringing in some cases, but I think genetics play a big role. You can't hide that with marriage. You may try, but it usually comes out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, then shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Honestly, I'm still bothered by the whole Iraq War thing. Sure, at first, I kinda understood it, everyone was on edge after 9/11, but I think we rushed into it for the wrong reasons. The Bush administration kept saying it was all about Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction, but we later found out that was a bunch of lies. That really rubs me the wrong way.  It feels like they straight-up lied to the American people, and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has since said he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then.  That's just wrong, in my opinion. It's like they don't care about the Constitution or anything. \n\nI get the feeling they wanted to go to war from the start. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book after he was basically pushed out of his job? He said the younger Bush came in wanting revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened with his dad. Plus, I think they were hoping to secure our energy supply, which is pretty shady.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably cause chaos with a civil war breaking out and even more people dying. But bringing in other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help out? That doesn't seem like a good solution either. It's going to mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and honestly, I don't think their government is working anyway. The Parliament seems useless, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any power. And don't even get me started on that extremist group, the one we were fighting not too long ago. They're now in Parliament with a bunch of seats. It's all so complicated, and I don't have all the answers.",
            "I'm not sure exactly how I feel about the war in Iraq.  It feels pointless, like it was just a way for us to get back at them for 9/11. I don't really follow the news about it, so I don't know all the details.  But my understanding is we're trying to build democracy there, kind of like making it another part of the US, and also to get access to their oil. But staying there just makes everyone upset.  \n\nBuilding a democracy takes a long time, and if we leave they'll be angry because they feel like we messed things up and abandoned them.  It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, this whole thing is really complicated. I don't know if it's right to keep sending our troops there, even though it's important to help those people. It feels like we're wasting our resources, and it's making President Bush look bad. We're starting to sound like we're just trying to show off our strength and power, like the Vietnam War.  \n\nI also think about the families of the soldiers who are in Iraq. I want them to come home safely, but I also worry about the people of Iraq and the impact of our presence on their lives and culture. \n\nWhat if we're just making things worse by trying to force our ideas on them? Maybe it's best to leave and let them find their own way, even if it's painful. This whole war seems like it's going to drag on for years and years. I just don't know what the right answer is.",
            "I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be going against what's already been written in stone. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another, because most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some areas like Boston. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they're thinking about making an amendment, I think it would be wrong and go against what's already been established. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason for an amendment banning it, other than personal views. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or anything else. It might even be positive for society.",
            "Ok, so the war in Iraq. To be honest, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about the reasons we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, but really, the two weren't that connected.  But the government played on people's emotions after 9/11,  and that's how the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. And I think this war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War. We should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's horrible. I think the government wasn't prepared for the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government. They weren't ready for the power vacuum and the unrest.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – we tried to push out Communism and install democracy, and it was a long, hard struggle. We should have known it wouldn't be a quick victory. In Vietnam, no matter how many people supported us, there were always insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people.\n\nSo, first, I think we shouldn't have gone to war at all. But if we're going to, we need to plan for everything. I don't think the government was prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. We're trying to train the Iraqi police and army, but it's a slow process.\n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, successful mission. But it takes years to build a new government.  Look at our own country – democracy took a long time to develop.  It wasn't easy.\n\n\nI think the government made it seem like it would be easy to change Iraq. \n\nIt's hard because we've been there so long. How can we just abandon them now after taking their government and way of life? But we also have to consider the cost in American lives. How many is too many?  \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is why Iraq? Why not other countries? I think it's all about oil. That's where our resources are. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. But we know North Korea has them, and we're not doing anything about it. I don't think the government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace. But I'm not sure that'll happen.",
            "Okay, so, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I really think it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it might even be biological, not just something about how you were raised.  So, to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control just seems wrong to me.  It feels kind of inhumane.  I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal thing, something that affects families and individuals, not the state. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though - walking their dogs, hanging out, you know? \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to define marriage in his own way. It's like he's playing God. \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be linked to something in your brain, like a biological predisposition. It's not about growing up with certain siblings or a lack of a father figure, it's more about something you're born with.\n\nBesides the obvious reason, it's just that marriage is something a guy and a girl can do secretly if they want to. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, like front-page news. It should be a private matter, not something the whole country is involved in.",
            "Okay, so basically, when you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's public knowledge.  As a resident advisor, I've actually dealt with this before.  \n\nWhat you post online can definitely shape how people perceive you. If you're talking about violence, like blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that out into the world. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on MySpace, you get their updates. The school wouldn't have gotten a bulletin directly; someone went to the school with this information. They had to act on it because they can't just ignore it, especially after something like 9/11.  You don't want them to be unprepared if something were to happen.\n\nHowever, it's tough to know what to take seriously because some people might just be joking around. Maybe it was a social experiment gone wrong for a class, or maybe it was something really serious.  \n\nIn one situation at our school, someone overheard a conversation and reported it. When they finally found the person, they looked through his Facebook and found some things that seemed harmless but became concerning given the situation.\n\nThe point is, once you put something online, there's no real privacy anymore. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. If you don't want people to see it or interpret it a certain way, you can't control that.\nSchools shouldn't be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.  They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if it's brought to their attention, that's a different story.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for way too long. Sure, the initial goal of spreading democracy to a country lacking it seemed good at the start. But, honestly, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove how powerful we are. I also wonder about the motives behind the war in the first place. There were those old conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, so maybe that played a part.  I mean, if the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country under a terrible leader, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But if personal grudges were involved, then that wouldn't be right. \n\nRegardless, the war has gone on for far too long. We made our point in those first few months when we launched the invasion. It was a powerful statement.  But it's been years now, and I think it's time to end it.  Maybe we were right to start the war, but I don't think our reasons have stayed clear. It feels like we're stuck in a never-ending conflict, just trying to win at all costs. \n\nIt's just not right to keep fighting this war forever. These people need to learn to govern themselves eventually, and that time is now. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while we have so many problems here at home. Poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—these are things that need our attention and resources. It's a huge drain on our economy, and it's happening for a cause that we've long since lost sight of.  \n\nWe need to stop spending billions on war and start investing in our own country. There are so many pressing issues that need our attention, and this war is just dragging us down.",
            "So, I'm curious about this situation. Was it stopped because someone stumbled upon information online?  Okay, so I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. Sure, you need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it when you add them as a friend.  Honestly, anything you put online should be seen as public knowledge. So, I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough though because you can't have someone constantly watching everyone's profiles to prevent problems. It would be discriminatory to target \"bad kids\" and focus on them. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to constantly monitor people's online activity. It depends on the situation though. Were they randomly looking at profiles, or were they specifically searching for evidence of something? I just don't know.\n\nI don't have Myspace personally, but I do have Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see all sorts of things about me. I saw a news story about a guy who easily found a girl's screen name and started IMing her, arranging to meet her within minutes. Obviously, I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes message me on IM who I don't recognize. They know my interests, what I look like, and even my class schedule. They know a lot about you from your profile. I try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I want to connect with friends. It's a tough balance.  You have to be careful who you let see your stuff.\n\nMy roommate told me about her high school banning Myspace. I didn't understand how they had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It felt a bit strange to me.",
            "I feel kinda hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who say they were always against it.  I mean, it's pretty obvious now that it was a bad idea, except for the people in charge who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls.  Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the rest of the world, people think it was a mistake.  Even most of the US troops over there think it was a bad idea and want us to leave. \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from the start.  Even before we invaded, things were bad, and now getting out is just going to be another disaster.  \n\nIt all comes down to the clash between American culture and the Middle East. The gap is just too big.  Our leaders think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly. It's like quicksand - once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay there.  The administration probably has some ideas, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually over a year or so, I guess I could understand that.  But I just don't see why we can't leave now.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone this year, and a quarter want us to leave immediately.  They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know best.\n\nAt least if we ask them and they say yes, it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say we were willing to stay, but they chose to leave.  \n\nIt won't make us heroes, but it's better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in. For example, women still face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposed to be a reality, they often find it hard to get promoted to higher positions. Men might be less likely to work under a woman because of how society has always been. \n\nSo, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not choose her simply because historically, women haven't been in leadership roles in business. It's the same for men, though. Like in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, there are expectations based on gender.\n\nIt's uncommon for a male to stay at home while his wife works, and people sometimes judge them for it. Society thinks the man should be the breadwinner, even if it's not what works best for the family.\n\nAnd in the fashion industry, straight men sometimes get dismissed as not being serious about fashion because society stereotypes men in the industry as having a certain lifestyle. People might wonder if they really understand fashion if they don't fit that stereotype.\n\nBasically, depending on the field, there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has these ingrained ideas. We've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow.\n\nThe good news is that things are slowly getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in business. More stay-at-home dads are accepted because people see that it works for some families. And maybe people in fashion are starting to realize that men can have valid opinions about fashion too.\n\nI think the key is to keep promoting the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. We can't force change, but if we highlight the strengths of those who are often overlooked, it will help shift attitudes.  We've already come so far, and with time, things will continue to improve.",
            "So, they didn't actually make marijuana legal.  They decriminalized it, meaning it's no longer a criminal offense.  Think of it like a traffic ticket instead of a serious arrest. You get cited, but you don't get booked or thrown in jail.\n\nNow, even though it's decriminalized, there are still worries about the long-term effects on things like job interviews. Those are the scary parts of a drug charge that don't disappear just because it's not a criminal offense anymore.\n\nBut, there's a financial aspect too. Arresting, booking, and processing people for marijuana offenses is incredibly expensive. There are court costs, public defenders, and state attorney fees. It all adds up!\n\nFor towns struggling financially, that cost is a big deal. Some places are just against marijuana, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize it. Maybe they can use that saved money on schools, social programs, or helping the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana openly sold everywhere, like cigarettes.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it's still considered taboo in many situations.\n\nAs for the effects, alcohol probably messes with your motor skills more, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. They both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things in moderation, while others struggle.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of Catholic traditions are very old and they've been practiced for a long time.  It's good to have those traditions, but it's also important to be open to change.  A lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week and there are strict rules about how things are done. Sometimes, it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules exactly and doesn't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics or people of other religions.  For example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths.  We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic belief, but it feels hypocritical to say that and then not accept people in that way.\n\nIt seems like Catholic teachings encourage certain things, but the way things are actually practiced often goes against those teachings because they're so old-fashioned. They just stick with them anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests who are abusive. It's a different problem. It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\nIt's hard to say, but I think people who abuse children would probably still do it even if they were married. It's about the power dynamic and the abuse itself, not about whether or not someone is married.  I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent this kind of abuse. It would probably still happen.",
            "Okay, so I'm still figuring this whole thing out. I haven't decided where I stand on this issue yet. It's really tough to say if either side is right or wrong because it's such a complicated topic. It's right on the edge of separation of church and state, and figuring out what marriage really means is super tricky without upsetting anyone. I don't know, but I think maybe civil unions are the way to go. It makes me wonder if the government should even be defining marriage, especially since it's considered a sacred thing by some. After all, the government doesn't give tax breaks or special treatment to people just because they were baptized, right? So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together. It's about their commitment to each other, not about the government getting involved in their religious beliefs.\n\nAnd about gay marriage... I think it gets complicated because it ties into all this stuff about separation of church and state. If it's a civil union, it should be treated the same as any other, regardless of who's involved.\n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That seems totally overboard. It just feels wrong to change the Constitution just for this.  It's a big deal for some people, but is it really big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment? I don't think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I have lots of gay friends, but I'm not sure I personally agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal.  I don't think it's something the whole country should be arguing about. I feel like each state should decide for themselves instead of leaving it up to the president.\n\nYou see, some states are more liberal, and others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it makes sense that you'd accept their stance on the issue. Choosing to live in a certain state means accepting their values, right?\n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, for that reason, I think gay marriage should be legal, but it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI don't think the president should be able to make that call for the whole country. It's not fair for him to impose his views on everyone.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each one is run.  Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway!  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just create more back-and-forth. It's much simpler if each state makes its own choice – they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.",
            "So, I don't think it's a big deal that school officials checked out what students posted on Myspace. I mean, Myspace is public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see.  If you put something on there, you have to realize that people will see it, even if it's not your parents or friends. That includes school officials, even if they're not looking at it under the school's name. They could easily see it from their own homes.  \n\nLook, preventing school shootings is super important. Keeping students safe is a big responsibility for schools, and if looking at Myspace helps them do that, then I'm okay with it.  \n\nNow, I get that it can feel like an invasion of privacy if teachers are constantly checking Myspace just to catch kids doing something wrong. Like, if they're digging through profiles looking for evidence of drinking or smoking, that's different. But if they have a reason to believe something is wrong and they use Myspace to investigate, I think that's fair.  \n\nThink about it: If you post something online, even an email, you have to be careful because it can come back to haunt you later. Everything you put out there stays out there forever.  \n\nIt's like a teacher told me - they have to do these things to keep the school safe. They have to be prepared for anything, just like they practice lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. It's all about making sure everyone stays safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted payback, you know? I thought going over there and causing as much trouble as they did here was the right thing to do. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We rushed into it unprepared, without a real plan. It feels like everything backfired. \n\nHonestly, I was all for it at the time, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. I feel like as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they won't be focusing on us.  \n\nBeing over there isn't helping; it just seems like a pointless mess. Because of 9/11, I just don't care about what happens over there anymore. It's hard to even think of those people as human, the way they fight and can't seem to get along.\n\nWe went in there totally blind; we didn't know what we were facing.  Their idea of war is so different from ours. They're savage, and I don't think they want to build a better country; they just want us out.\n\nMaybe we should just leave. I think we were more hyped up than rational. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change everything. It felt like we were looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it after 9/11.\n\nI get where he was coming from, though. After what happened, we couldn't just ignore it. But I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear about what we were trying to achieve, and there was no unity. We didn't know what we were getting into.\n\nIt seems like everything was driven by emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. I think they'll always be like that. I don't know what else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but it's not enough to justify staying. I think no matter how long we're there, it'll collapse when we leave. We can't stay forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying."
