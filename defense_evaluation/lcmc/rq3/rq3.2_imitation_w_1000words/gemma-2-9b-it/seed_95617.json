            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. They've been noticing a decline in followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of modern ideas.\n\nTake issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong, traditional views on these, which is fine, but they seem a bit outdated. If they were more open to different viewpoints, maybe they wouldn't be losing people.  \n\nI've heard that some folks are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these topics. People are looking for a church that aligns with their own beliefs, especially on things like abortion and gay marriage. If you believe in those things, you might not feel comfortable in a church that condemns them.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a job and a family life. Why shouldn't priests?",
            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage. I think people should be able to marry whoever they love, whether they were born that way or not. It's not like it's a choice someone makes.  It feels wrong to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about it too much, but I think it's unfair to deny people the right to marry just because of who they are. It's like being born straight or gay – it's just part of who you are. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this. It's a personal decision, not something that affects national security or morality. It seems like the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to tell people who they can and can't marry. It's not their place to judge people's relationships.\n\nIt's just not right to treat people differently because of their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be made to feel ashamed or like they made a wrong choice. It's who they are, and that's okay.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There isn't a strong reason against it. Some people worry that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but completely different.  \n\nThere are also lots of civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't always be by your side in the hospital or make decisions for you if you're sick because they aren't legally considered family. That seems unfair if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships are just as successful as heterosexual ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. \n\nWhat people are really arguing about is the legal definition of marriage, not religious ceremonies. Gay couples want a government-issued marriage certificate, not a church blessing.  \n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. They deserve the same rights and recognition. Some people worry about adoption and its impact on children, but studies show no difference in outcomes for children raised by same-sex couples compared to those raised by heterosexual couples.\n\nThe real issue is societal prejudice. Kids of gay parents sometimes face bullying and discrimination, which is heartbreaking. \n\nUltimately, the government should support equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's views on this issue seem heavily influenced by his religion, which is a personal belief that shouldn't dictate policy for everyone. \n\nSome people believe gayness is a psychological disorder, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth. We should trust scientific evidence and challenge harmful stereotypes.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs. Like, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful. I mean, think about it: there are tons of drugs that pharmacies use all the time, even though they're controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. Those are powerful medications, but they're used because they actually help people.  If we're saying marijuana can't be used for medical purposes just because it's illegal, that seems kinda unfair. It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nI know some people think marijuana is a gateway drug and will lead to worse things, but alcohol can be pretty harmful too if you abuse it. It's a tough issue. Maybe the best approach would be to gradually make it legal, so we don't see a huge surge in abuse right away. But first, we need to get rid of the stigma around marijuana. If people don't see it as this scary, dangerous substance, they might be more likely to use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to fit the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now that I'm older, they've started a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see families rushing in from the beach still in their swimsuits. The morning masses, which I used to always dress up for, are now full of people in jeans and khakis. Things are definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other things, like the priest abuse scandals, I don't think allowing women priests or married priests would have prevented those. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's about the individual, not their marital status. I think people choose to become priests, and if they want to be married, they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic, not something people choose. You can't hide that with marriage. It might come out eventually. The church might have covered up some cases, but I don't think they could have stopped it entirely.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were coming from at first, but everyone was still super shaken up after 9/11. I feel like the Iraq War was kind of a setup, you know? There were reasons they gave us, but looking back…  \n\nThe Bush administration kept saying that the Iraq War was connected to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, and that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, that was all a bunch of lies. And that really grinds my gears.  \n\nHonestly, it just feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just straight-up wrong. It's like, they didn't care about the Constitution, they just wanted to go to war.\n\nI think they came into office with the goal of going to war already set in stone. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book saying that? He was probably pushed out of his job, but it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he wanted to control more of the oil supply, too. Pretty shady, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause a huge mess, though. There's a good chance Iraq would fall into civil war and even more people would die. \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries in the area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to help restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could cause even more problems down the road because Iraq's independence would be a huge issue. \n\nThe news says the Parliament isn't really working, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have a lot of power. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party has a bunch of seats in Parliament now! There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's all pretty chaotic.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't officially declared a war, you know? It felt more like a \"get back\" at Iraq because they were blamed for 9/11. Honestly, I'm not really up-to-date on all the details. I guess the idea is to build a democracy there, like another America, and maybe get some oil while we're at it. But it's just causing a lot of anger and resentment, and staying there isn't really solving anything.\n\nIt's a tough situation. If we leave, they'll be upset because they feel like we abandoned them after messing things up. But if we stay, it'll take forever to build a stable democracy, and it might not even work.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing is really complicated. I feel bad for the families with loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. But I also think it's costing us a lot of resources and making us look bad on the world stage. It's like the Vietnam War; it was an undeclared war that ended up being called meaningless.  I worry that this will be remembered as another one of those.",
            "I strongly believe it's wrong for the government to make laws about this issue. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices would go against that principle. \n\nIt feels like those pushing to make it illegal are simply favoring one church's beliefs over others.  Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution, allowing for religious freedom in the United States. Even discussing a potential amendment on this topic feels wrong, because it contradicts what's already established.  It would be one of the few amendments aimed at restricting people rather than the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The person pushing for this amendment seems to be motivated by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it appears he's favoring one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide these matters, not the president or any government official. There's no real justification for this amendment besides personal views.\n\nI don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or society. It might even have a positive effect.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11, and that's how the invasion started in 2003.  \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes.  \n\nThis war feels a lot like Vietnam in many ways, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. \n\nThe US was trying to put in a new democratic government, kind of like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to push back against communism.  But the government should have known it wouldn't be a quick, clear victory. It was more of a loss in Vietnam, and it's playing out the same way here.  \n\nNo matter how many people might support the US, there will always be insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nSo, I think the government should have never gotten involved in the first place. But if they had to, they needed to be fully prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there at the end of 2006, with American troops still dying, and they're struggling to train Iraqi forces. \n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a simple mission, but building a new government takes a lot of time and effort.  Look at our own history – democracy took a long fight to establish.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough situation. It's hard to walk away after we've been there so long. We took their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a democratic Iraq?\n\nIt makes you wonder why it's just Iraq. Why aren't we doing the same for other countries? It feels like it's all about the oil, and the control it gives us.  Remember the whole \"weapons of mass destruction\" thing? We never found them, yet we haven't done anything about North Korea, which we know has them. \n\nIt makes you question if the government is being truthful in their decisions. All I can hope for is a peaceful resolution soon.",
            "Let me tell you, I’m all for gay marriage. Always have been.  I truly believe it’s a personal choice, something that science is increasingly showing has a biological basis rather than being purely a social construct.  It just seems wrong to limit someone’s rights based on something they can’t control. It feels inhumane, you know? I’ve been a strong supporter of gay marriage for a long time.\n\nTo me, politics and government shouldn’t have a say in this at all. It’s about personal relationships, about families.  Right here in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren’t married because they can’t be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, being neighbors.  But it’s frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to dictate what marriage means, playing God with the very definition of it.  It’s ridiculous, if you ask me.\n\nI’ve read and heard from a lot of sources – news articles, TV reports, you name it – that being gay might have a biological component. It could be something you’re predisposed to, like a chemical makeup in your brain, rather than something you choose based on your upbringing or environment. That’s the biological side, as opposed to the sociological side.\n\nBeyond the ethical implications, there’s this whole public vs. private thing.  A straight couple can get married quietly, no fuss. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news. It shouldn't be this public spectacle. It should be a personal, private matter, not something the government gets to control.",
            "When you share something online, it's essentially in a public space.  Think of it like a town square where everyone can see and read what you post. As a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand how what people put online can impact others' perceptions of them. If you're talking about harmful things like violence or explosions, someone's likely to take notice and react.  \n\nThe internet reaches a vast audience – if you're friends with someone on MySpace, they'll see your bulletin.  Someone might bring something they saw online to the attention of the school, and they have a responsibility to investigate. They can't ignore a potential threat, even if it seems like a joke.\n\nOf course, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes people just goof around.  Maybe it was a harmless experiment for a sociology class that went awry. But sometimes, what seems like a joke can become serious, especially in light of a recent incident. \n\nThink of it this way: if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it online. You can't control how people interpret your words, but you can control what you share. It's a matter of personal responsibility.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friend-requesting their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a duty to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone has shared it publicly.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. I don't believe teachers should create fake social media accounts to befriend their students, as that crosses a line.  Personally, I wouldn't want to know what my residents are doing on their social media accounts, as it's not my place to monitor their personal lives.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long.  Initially, I thought the goal was noble – to bring democracy to a country that lacked fair political systems. However, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power on the world stage.  There were also questions about the motives from the beginning, especially regarding any past issues between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the goal truly was to establish democracy in a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But I think our reasons have become muddled over time. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a clear victory to justify our continued involvement.\n\nThe war lasted for months and years beyond what was initially needed to make a statement. At some point, the Iraqi government and its people need to take responsibility for their own future. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict while neglecting our own pressing issues here at home, like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare.  \n\nSpending so much on a war that has lost its purpose is draining our economy. We should be investing in our own citizens and addressing the problems within our own borders.  It's simply not right to continue sacrificing our own people for a war that no longer serves a clear purpose.",
            "So, I'm thinking about this thing where someone found information on Myspace and was able to stop something bad from happening.  I get that it's a good thing, you know, saving a life and all. But it makes me wonder, is it okay to look through people's profiles like that? Like, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right? So if you're friends with someone, isn't that kind of giving them permission to see your stuff? I mean, once you put something online, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  \n\nIt's a tough situation. You can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, but it also seems wrong to just randomly look at people's stuff.  It feels like discrimination if they're only looking at certain people's profiles, like the \"bad kids.\"\n\nI'm a little creeped out by the idea that people can find out so much about me online. I know there are weird people out there who look through profiles and stuff. I saw this thing on TV where this guy figured out a girl's screen name and started IMing her in less than a minute. It made me think, how much do we really know about the people we're \"friends\" with online?\n\nI try to be careful about what I put on Facebook, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\n\nI also heard that some high schools banned Myspace. That seems weird to me. Like, how can they tell kids they can't have Myspace? Isn't that kind of invading their privacy?",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else was already against it from the start. But honestly, it doesn't really matter now. It's pretty clear that the war was a bad idea, except maybe to the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls –  Americans, Iraqis, even people all around the world think it was a mistake.  A lot of the U.S. troops over there agree, too. They think we should pull out within a year.\n\nLooking back, the whole thing has been a disaster. It was already a mess before we got involved, and pulling out is going to be tough too.  The Middle East is a complicated place, and there's a huge gap between American culture and the culture there. It seems like the U.S. government just wants to force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about the consequences is never the answer. It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The government might have some ideas, but I haven't heard anything that makes sense. If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but it just feels like we should leave now.  \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a lot of them want us to leave immediately. Those are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least they made the decision. If things go bad, we can say we were going to stay, but they asked us to leave.  Maybe that makes us the good guys in the end, even if we're never truly good guys in the Middle East.  At least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the US. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in.  Women face a \"glass ceiling\" where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, a lot of people still struggle with the idea of having a woman as their boss. This is because society has always been this way, and it takes time to change. So, a woman might be perfectly qualified for a job, but the people making the hiring decisions might not choose her because they picture someone else in that position – someone who's male. \n\nThe same goes for men in some fields, like being a stay-at-home parent. It's not common to see dads staying home, and people often look down on it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they might question why a man isn't working if he's at home. This can be tough for those dads who truly want to raise their kids and whose wives might be the ones earning the income. \n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Men who are interested in fashion can sometimes be dismissed because people assume they don't really understand women's fashion. It's like they have to prove themselves more because their interests don't fit the stereotype.\n\nOverall, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in the US, and it varies depending on what field you're in. Change is happening, though. More women are reaching high positions, and more men are embracing their roles as stay-at-home dads. But it's a slow process. It's important to keep pushing for equality, but also to do it in a way that doesn't feel forced. We need to highlight the qualities of those who are often stereotyped and let people see that they deserve respect and recognition for their talents and skills",
            "So basically, instead of making marijuana illegal, they decided to decriminalize it. This means it's not a crime anymore, more like a traffic ticket.  You get a citation instead of being arrested, booked, and hauled into court.  \n\nThere are still some worries about the downsides, though. Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews could still be affected by a marijuana citation. It's a big deal for a lot of people, especially young folks.\n\nBut on the other hand, getting people arrested and processed for marijuana is really expensive for everyone.  Think about it: police time, court costs, lawyers, jail time... it all adds up.  \n\nSome cities are strapped for cash and see decriminalization as a way to save money. They could use that money for things like schools, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, seem to be doing alright with decriminalization. They're probably using the money saved to help their community.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about what would happen if marijuana were fully legalized.  Would it be sold everywhere, like cigarettes?  Would people be smoking it while driving? It's still considered a bit taboo in a lot of places, so that could be awkward.\n\nIt's tricky to compare marijuana and alcohol. Alcohol might be worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with a person's life in other ways. \n\nIt all depends on the person. Some people can handle any substance in moderation, while others struggle. There's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to drugs.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do seems really traditional. They've been doing things the same way for ages, and it's good to have strong roots in tradition.  But it's also important to be able to change with the times. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Honestly, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't seem very welcoming to people who aren't exactly \"perfect Catholics,\" and they don't really accept people of other religions either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very tolerant to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic value, but it seems hypocritical to say you love people and then not accept them.\n\nSo, it feels like a lot of Catholic teaching tells you to do one thing, but the actual practice goes against it because it's so old-fashioned. They just keep doing things the same way.\n\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily solve everything. I personally think it would be good, but I don't think it would stop pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue.\n\nThe people who abuse children would probably do it regardless of whether they were married or not because they're targeting children, which is different from a spouse. \n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent these things from happening; they would probably still happen.",
            "I'm still figuring things out on this whole marriage equality debate. It's tough because it touches on such sensitive issues like separating church and state and figuring out what marriage really means.  I don't think it's easy to address this topic without upsetting people.  It feels like a real balancing act.  \n\nPersonally, I think civil unions are a good starting point. Maybe we shouldn't let the government define what constitutes a \"marriage\" since it's often seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't treat baptisms or other religious ceremonies in a specific way. If you're in a civil union, it's simply two people who have committed to each other. The government shouldn't get involved in the \"what kind of marriage\" conversation, just recognize the union.\n\nI think if all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment feels wrong.  It's just too big of a deal to change the Constitution over something like this. There are important issues that deserve that kind of attention.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. I have many gay friends, and while I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each state individually, not the president.\n\nThink about it: some states lean Democratic, others Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're kind of accepting their stance. \n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, I think legalization should be left to the states.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It shouldn't be up to him to decide for the whole country, especially since he doesn't live in every state. States should have the autonomy to decide what's best for their residents. Plus, with Bush leaving office soon, a Democratic president could overturn the ban, creating constant back-and-forth. It's better to let each state make its own decision and live with the consequences.",
            "I don't think posting things on Myspace is private. It's like a bulletin board, open for anyone to see, including school officials. If you're putting something on the internet, you have to realize that people might see it, even if they aren't looking for trouble.\n\nI get that they shouldn't be constantly snooping, but if seeing something online helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, I think it's okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and if that means looking online sometimes, I think it's justified.\n\nIt's like if they find out students are drinking or smoking through their Myspace pages. That's not cool, but I understand why they'd want to stop those things.\n\nIt's just like emails – you shouldn't write things on emails you wouldn't want anyone else to see. Everything online can come back to bite you later. Once it's out there, it's out there forever.\n\nI think it's a bit different if they're specifically trying to catch students doing something wrong, but if they stumble across something that could prevent a tragedy, then they should absolutely act on it. Parents drop their kids off at school expecting it to be a safe place, and the school has to do everything it can to make sure that's the case. Just like with lockdown drills and security measures after 9/11, they're just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, after 9/11, I was totally on board. I was so affected personally that I wanted revenge, you know?  I felt like we should go in there and make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We didn't really think things through, we just jumped in unprepared and without a plan. \n\nHonestly, I think it backfired. I don't think it achieved anything. If anything, it just made things worse. It's like, those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  It's hard for me to care about what's going on there. They can't even get along with each other, so why should we be trying to fix their problems? \n\nI know 9/11 was a huge deal, but  I just don't think we were ready for what we were walking into. It's not like war here, it's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making things better, they just want us out. Honestly, I think we should just leave. \n\nI think it was mostly anger and revenge that drove us to go to war. I think President Bush felt like he had to do something, and the people wanted action. But we should have thought it through more. We didn't have a clear plan for what we were going to do, and there wasn't any unity on what our goals were.\n\nAnd I think we're fooling ourselves if we think we can change them. They're just going to keep fighting, no matter what we do.  I think we're hurting ourselves more than we're helping them.  We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there.  It's just going to collapse again once we leave, and we can't stay there forever."

heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. They've been noticing a decline in followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of modern ideas.\n\nTake issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong, traditional views on these, which is fine, but they seem a bit outdated. If they were more open to different viewpoints, maybe they wouldn't be losing people.  \n\nI've heard that some folks are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these topics. People are looking for a church that aligns with their own beliefs, especially on things like abortion and gay marriage. If you believe in those things, you might not feel comfortable in a church that condemns them.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a job and a family life. Why shouldn't priests?",
            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage. I think people should be able to marry whoever they love, whether they were born that way or not. It's not like it's a choice someone makes.  It feels wrong to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about it too much, but I think it's unfair to deny people the right to marry just because of who they are. It's like being born straight or gay – it's just part of who you are. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this. It's a personal decision, not something that affects national security or morality. It seems like the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to tell people who they can and can't marry. It's not their place to judge people's relationships.\n\nIt's just not right to treat people differently because of their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be made to feel ashamed or like they made a wrong choice. It's who they are, and that's okay.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There isn't a strong reason against it. Some people worry that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but completely different.  \n\nThere are also lots of civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't always be by your side in the hospital or make decisions for you if you're sick because they aren't legally considered family. That seems unfair if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships are just as successful as heterosexual ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. \n\nWhat people are really arguing about is the legal definition of marriage, not religious ceremonies. Gay couples want a government-issued marriage certificate, not a church blessing.  \n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. They deserve the same rights and recognition. Some people worry about adoption and its impact on children, but studies show no difference in outcomes for children raised by same-sex couples compared to those raised by heterosexual couples.\n\nThe real issue is societal prejudice. Kids of gay parents sometimes face bullying and discrimination, which is heartbreaking. \n\nUltimately, the government should support equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's views on this issue seem heavily influenced by his religion, which is a personal belief that shouldn't dictate policy for everyone. \n\nSome people believe gayness is a psychological disorder, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth. We should trust scientific evidence and challenge harmful stereotypes.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs. Like, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful. I mean, think about it: there are tons of drugs that pharmacies use all the time, even though they're controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. Those are powerful medications, but they're used because they actually help people.  If we're saying marijuana can't be used for medical purposes just because it's illegal, that seems kinda unfair. It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nI know some people think marijuana is a gateway drug and will lead to worse things, but alcohol can be pretty harmful too if you abuse it. It's a tough issue. Maybe the best approach would be to gradually make it legal, so we don't see a huge surge in abuse right away. But first, we need to get rid of the stigma around marijuana. If people don't see it as this scary, dangerous substance, they might be more likely to use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to fit the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now that I'm older, they've started a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see families rushing in from the beach still in their swimsuits. The morning masses, which I used to always dress up for, are now full of people in jeans and khakis. Things are definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other things, like the priest abuse scandals, I don't think allowing women priests or married priests would have prevented those. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's about the individual, not their marital status. I think people choose to become priests, and if they want to be married, they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic, not something people choose. You can't hide that with marriage. It might come out eventually. The church might have covered up some cases, but I don't think they could have stopped it entirely.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were coming from at first, but everyone was still super shaken up after 9/11. I feel like the Iraq War was kind of a setup, you know? There were reasons they gave us, but looking back…  \n\nThe Bush administration kept saying that the Iraq War was connected to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, and that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, that was all a bunch of lies. And that really grinds my gears.  \n\nHonestly, it just feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just straight-up wrong. It's like, they didn't care about the Constitution, they just wanted to go to war.\n\nI think they came into office with the goal of going to war already set in stone. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book saying that? He was probably pushed out of his job, but it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he wanted to control more of the oil supply, too. Pretty shady, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause a huge mess, though. There's a good chance Iraq would fall into civil war and even more people would die. \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries in the area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to help restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could cause even more problems down the road because Iraq's independence would be a huge issue. \n\nThe news says the Parliament isn't really working, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have a lot of power. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party has a bunch of seats in Parliament now! There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's all pretty chaotic.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't officially declared a war, you know? It felt more like a \"get back\" at Iraq because they were blamed for 9/11. Honestly, I'm not really up-to-date on all the details. I guess the idea is to build a democracy there, like another America, and maybe get some oil while we're at it. But it's just causing a lot of anger and resentment, and staying there isn't really solving anything.\n\nIt's a tough situation. If we leave, they'll be upset because they feel like we abandoned them after messing things up. But if we stay, it'll take forever to build a stable democracy, and it might not even work.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing is really complicated. I feel bad for the families with loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. But I also think it's costing us a lot of resources and making us look bad on the world stage. It's like the Vietnam War; it was an undeclared war that ended up being called meaningless.  I worry that this will be remembered as another one of those.",
            "I strongly believe it's wrong for the government to make laws about this issue. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices would go against that principle. \n\nIt feels like those pushing to make it illegal are simply favoring one church's beliefs over others.  Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution, allowing for religious freedom in the United States. Even discussing a potential amendment on this topic feels wrong, because it contradicts what's already established.  It would be one of the few amendments aimed at restricting people rather than the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The person pushing for this amendment seems to be motivated by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it appears he's favoring one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide these matters, not the president or any government official. There's no real justification for this amendment besides personal views.\n\nI don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or society. It might even have a positive effect.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11, and that's how the invasion started in 2003.  \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes.  \n\nThis war feels a lot like Vietnam in many ways, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. \n\nThe US was trying to put in a new democratic government, kind of like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to push back against communism.  But the government should have known it wouldn't be a quick, clear victory. It was more of a loss in Vietnam, and it's playing out the same way here.  \n\nNo matter how many people might support the US, there will always be insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nSo, I think the government should have never gotten involved in the first place. But if they had to, they needed to be fully prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there at the end of 2006, with American troops still dying, and they're struggling to train Iraqi forces. \n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a simple mission, but building a new government takes a lot of time and effort.  Look at our own history – democracy took a long fight to establish.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough situation. It's hard to walk away after we've been there so long. We took their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a democratic Iraq?\n\nIt makes you wonder why it's just Iraq. Why aren't we doing the same for other countries? It feels like it's all about the oil, and the control it gives us.  Remember the whole \"weapons of mass destruction\" thing? We never found them, yet we haven't done anything about North Korea, which we know has them. \n\nIt makes you question if the government is being truthful in their decisions. All I can hope for is a peaceful resolution soon.",
            "Let me tell you, I’m all for gay marriage. Always have been.  I truly believe it’s a personal choice, something that science is increasingly showing has a biological basis rather than being purely a social construct.  It just seems wrong to limit someone’s rights based on something they can’t control. It feels inhumane, you know? I’ve been a strong supporter of gay marriage for a long time.\n\nTo me, politics and government shouldn’t have a say in this at all. It’s about personal relationships, about families.  Right here in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren’t married because they can’t be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, being neighbors.  But it’s frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to dictate what marriage means, playing God with the very definition of it.  It’s ridiculous, if you ask me.\n\nI’ve read and heard from a lot of sources – news articles, TV reports, you name it – that being gay might have a biological component. It could be something you’re predisposed to, like a chemical makeup in your brain, rather than something you choose based on your upbringing or environment. That’s the biological side, as opposed to the sociological side.\n\nBeyond the ethical implications, there’s this whole public vs. private thing.  A straight couple can get married quietly, no fuss. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news. It shouldn't be this public spectacle. It should be a personal, private matter, not something the government gets to control.",
            "When you share something online, it's essentially in a public space.  Think of it like a town square where everyone can see and read what you post. As a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand how what people put online can impact others' perceptions of them. If you're talking about harmful things like violence or explosions, someone's likely to take notice and react.  \n\nThe internet reaches a vast audience – if you're friends with someone on MySpace, they'll see your bulletin.  Someone might bring something they saw online to the attention of the school, and they have a responsibility to investigate. They can't ignore a potential threat, even if it seems like a joke.\n\nOf course, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes people just goof around.  Maybe it was a harmless experiment for a sociology class that went awry. But sometimes, what seems like a joke can become serious, especially in light of a recent incident. \n\nThink of it this way: if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it online. You can't control how people interpret your words, but you can control what you share. It's a matter of personal responsibility.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friend-requesting their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a duty to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone has shared it publicly.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. I don't believe teachers should create fake social media accounts to befriend their students, as that crosses a line.  Personally, I wouldn't want to know what my residents are doing on their social media accounts, as it's not my place to monitor their personal lives.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long.  Initially, I thought the goal was noble – to bring democracy to a country that lacked fair political systems. However, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power on the world stage.  There were also questions about the motives from the beginning, especially regarding any past issues between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the goal truly was to establish democracy in a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But I think our reasons have become muddled over time. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a clear victory to justify our continued involvement.\n\nThe war lasted for months and years beyond what was initially needed to make a statement. At some point, the Iraqi government and its people need to take responsibility for their own future. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict while neglecting our own pressing issues here at home, like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare.  \n\nSpending so much on a war that has lost its purpose is draining our economy. We should be investing in our own citizens and addressing the problems within our own borders.  It's simply not right to continue sacrificing our own people for a war that no longer serves a clear purpose.",
            "So, I'm thinking about this thing where someone found information on Myspace and was able to stop something bad from happening.  I get that it's a good thing, you know, saving a life and all. But it makes me wonder, is it okay to look through people's profiles like that? Like, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right? So if you're friends with someone, isn't that kind of giving them permission to see your stuff? I mean, once you put something online, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  \n\nIt's a tough situation. You can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, but it also seems wrong to just randomly look at people's stuff.  It feels like discrimination if they're only looking at certain people's profiles, like the \"bad kids.\"\n\nI'm a little creeped out by the idea that people can find out so much about me online. I know there are weird people out there who look through profiles and stuff. I saw this thing on TV where this guy figured out a girl's screen name and started IMing her in less than a minute. It made me think, how much do we really know about the people we're \"friends\" with online?\n\nI try to be careful about what I put on Facebook, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\n\nI also heard that some high schools banned Myspace. That seems weird to me. Like, how can they tell kids they can't have Myspace? Isn't that kind of invading their privacy?",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else was already against it from the start. But honestly, it doesn't really matter now. It's pretty clear that the war was a bad idea, except maybe to the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls –  Americans, Iraqis, even people all around the world think it was a mistake.  A lot of the U.S. troops over there agree, too. They think we should pull out within a year.\n\nLooking back, the whole thing has been a disaster. It was already a mess before we got involved, and pulling out is going to be tough too.  The Middle East is a complicated place, and there's a huge gap between American culture and the culture there. It seems like the U.S. government just wants to force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about the consequences is never the answer. It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The government might have some ideas, but I haven't heard anything that makes sense. If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but it just feels like we should leave now.  \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a lot of them want us to leave immediately. Those are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least they made the decision. If things go bad, we can say we were going to stay, but they asked us to leave.  Maybe that makes us the good guys in the end, even if we're never truly good guys in the Middle East.  At least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the US. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in.  Women face a \"glass ceiling\" where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, a lot of people still struggle with the idea of having a woman as their boss. This is because society has always been this way, and it takes time to change. So, a woman might be perfectly qualified for a job, but the people making the hiring decisions might not choose her because they picture someone else in that position – someone who's male. \n\nThe same goes for men in some fields, like being a stay-at-home parent. It's not common to see dads staying home, and people often look down on it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they might question why a man isn't working if he's at home. This can be tough for those dads who truly want to raise their kids and whose wives might be the ones earning the income. \n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Men who are interested in fashion can sometimes be dismissed because people assume they don't really understand women's fashion. It's like they have to prove themselves more because their interests don't fit the stereotype.\n\nOverall, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in the US, and it varies depending on what field you're in. Change is happening, though. More women are reaching high positions, and more men are embracing their roles as stay-at-home dads. But it's a slow process. It's important to keep pushing for equality, but also to do it in a way that doesn't feel forced. We need to highlight the qualities of those who are often stereotyped and let people see that they deserve respect and recognition for their talents and skills",
            "So basically, instead of making marijuana illegal, they decided to decriminalize it. This means it's not a crime anymore, more like a traffic ticket.  You get a citation instead of being arrested, booked, and hauled into court.  \n\nThere are still some worries about the downsides, though. Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews could still be affected by a marijuana citation. It's a big deal for a lot of people, especially young folks.\n\nBut on the other hand, getting people arrested and processed for marijuana is really expensive for everyone.  Think about it: police time, court costs, lawyers, jail time... it all adds up.  \n\nSome cities are strapped for cash and see decriminalization as a way to save money. They could use that money for things like schools, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, seem to be doing alright with decriminalization. They're probably using the money saved to help their community.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about what would happen if marijuana were fully legalized.  Would it be sold everywhere, like cigarettes?  Would people be smoking it while driving? It's still considered a bit taboo in a lot of places, so that could be awkward.\n\nIt's tricky to compare marijuana and alcohol. Alcohol might be worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with a person's life in other ways. \n\nIt all depends on the person. Some people can handle any substance in moderation, while others struggle. There's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to drugs.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do seems really traditional. They've been doing things the same way for ages, and it's good to have strong roots in tradition.  But it's also important to be able to change with the times. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Honestly, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't seem very welcoming to people who aren't exactly \"perfect Catholics,\" and they don't really accept people of other religions either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very tolerant to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic value, but it seems hypocritical to say you love people and then not accept them.\n\nSo, it feels like a lot of Catholic teaching tells you to do one thing, but the actual practice goes against it because it's so old-fashioned. They just keep doing things the same way.\n\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily solve everything. I personally think it would be good, but I don't think it would stop pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue.\n\nThe people who abuse children would probably do it regardless of whether they were married or not because they're targeting children, which is different from a spouse. \n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent these things from happening; they would probably still happen.",
            "I'm still figuring things out on this whole marriage equality debate. It's tough because it touches on such sensitive issues like separating church and state and figuring out what marriage really means.  I don't think it's easy to address this topic without upsetting people.  It feels like a real balancing act.  \n\nPersonally, I think civil unions are a good starting point. Maybe we shouldn't let the government define what constitutes a \"marriage\" since it's often seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't treat baptisms or other religious ceremonies in a specific way. If you're in a civil union, it's simply two people who have committed to each other. The government shouldn't get involved in the \"what kind of marriage\" conversation, just recognize the union.\n\nI think if all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment feels wrong.  It's just too big of a deal to change the Constitution over something like this. There are important issues that deserve that kind of attention.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. I have many gay friends, and while I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each state individually, not the president.\n\nThink about it: some states lean Democratic, others Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're kind of accepting their stance. \n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, I think legalization should be left to the states.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It shouldn't be up to him to decide for the whole country, especially since he doesn't live in every state. States should have the autonomy to decide what's best for their residents. Plus, with Bush leaving office soon, a Democratic president could overturn the ban, creating constant back-and-forth. It's better to let each state make its own decision and live with the consequences.",
            "I don't think posting things on Myspace is private. It's like a bulletin board, open for anyone to see, including school officials. If you're putting something on the internet, you have to realize that people might see it, even if they aren't looking for trouble.\n\nI get that they shouldn't be constantly snooping, but if seeing something online helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, I think it's okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and if that means looking online sometimes, I think it's justified.\n\nIt's like if they find out students are drinking or smoking through their Myspace pages. That's not cool, but I understand why they'd want to stop those things.\n\nIt's just like emails – you shouldn't write things on emails you wouldn't want anyone else to see. Everything online can come back to bite you later. Once it's out there, it's out there forever.\n\nI think it's a bit different if they're specifically trying to catch students doing something wrong, but if they stumble across something that could prevent a tragedy, then they should absolutely act on it. Parents drop their kids off at school expecting it to be a safe place, and the school has to do everything it can to make sure that's the case. Just like with lockdown drills and security measures after 9/11, they're just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, after 9/11, I was totally on board. I was so affected personally that I wanted revenge, you know?  I felt like we should go in there and make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We didn't really think things through, we just jumped in unprepared and without a plan. \n\nHonestly, I think it backfired. I don't think it achieved anything. If anything, it just made things worse. It's like, those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  It's hard for me to care about what's going on there. They can't even get along with each other, so why should we be trying to fix their problems? \n\nI know 9/11 was a huge deal, but  I just don't think we were ready for what we were walking into. It's not like war here, it's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making things better, they just want us out. Honestly, I think we should just leave. \n\nI think it was mostly anger and revenge that drove us to go to war. I think President Bush felt like he had to do something, and the people wanted action. But we should have thought it through more. We didn't have a clear plan for what we were going to do, and there wasn't any unity on what our goals were.\n\nAnd I think we're fooling ourselves if we think we can change them. They're just going to keep fighting, no matter what we do.  I think we're hurting ourselves more than we're helping them.  We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there.  It's just going to collapse again once we leave, and we can't stay there forever."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. They've been noticing a decline in followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of modern ideas.\n\nTake issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong, traditional views on these, which is fine, but they seem a bit outdated. If they were more open to different viewpoints, maybe they wouldn't be losing people.  \n\nI've heard that some folks are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these topics. People are looking for a church that aligns with their own beliefs, especially on things like abortion and gay marriage. If you believe in those things, you might not feel comfortable in a church that condemns them.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a job and a family life. Why shouldn't priests?",
            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage. I think people should be able to marry whoever they love, whether they were born that way or not. It's not like it's a choice someone makes.  It feels wrong to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about it too much, but I think it's unfair to deny people the right to marry just because of who they are. It's like being born straight or gay – it's just part of who you are. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this. It's a personal decision, not something that affects national security or morality. It seems like the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to tell people who they can and can't marry. It's not their place to judge people's relationships.\n\nIt's just not right to treat people differently because of their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be made to feel ashamed or like they made a wrong choice. It's who they are, and that's okay.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There isn't a strong reason against it. Some people worry that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but completely different.  \n\nThere are also lots of civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't always be by your side in the hospital or make decisions for you if you're sick because they aren't legally considered family. That seems unfair if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships are just as successful as heterosexual ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. \n\nWhat people are really arguing about is the legal definition of marriage, not religious ceremonies. Gay couples want a government-issued marriage certificate, not a church blessing.  \n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. They deserve the same rights and recognition. Some people worry about adoption and its impact on children, but studies show no difference in outcomes for children raised by same-sex couples compared to those raised by heterosexual couples.\n\nThe real issue is societal prejudice. Kids of gay parents sometimes face bullying and discrimination, which is heartbreaking. \n\nUltimately, the government should support equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's views on this issue seem heavily influenced by his religion, which is a personal belief that shouldn't dictate policy for everyone. \n\nSome people believe gayness is a psychological disorder, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth. We should trust scientific evidence and challenge harmful stereotypes.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs. Like, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful. I mean, think about it: there are tons of drugs that pharmacies use all the time, even though they're controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. Those are powerful medications, but they're used because they actually help people.  If we're saying marijuana can't be used for medical purposes just because it's illegal, that seems kinda unfair. It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nI know some people think marijuana is a gateway drug and will lead to worse things, but alcohol can be pretty harmful too if you abuse it. It's a tough issue. Maybe the best approach would be to gradually make it legal, so we don't see a huge surge in abuse right away. But first, we need to get rid of the stigma around marijuana. If people don't see it as this scary, dangerous substance, they might be more likely to use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to fit the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now that I'm older, they've started a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see families rushing in from the beach still in their swimsuits. The morning masses, which I used to always dress up for, are now full of people in jeans and khakis. Things are definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other things, like the priest abuse scandals, I don't think allowing women priests or married priests would have prevented those. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's about the individual, not their marital status. I think people choose to become priests, and if they want to be married, they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic, not something people choose. You can't hide that with marriage. It might come out eventually. The church might have covered up some cases, but I don't think they could have stopped it entirely.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were coming from at first, but everyone was still super shaken up after 9/11. I feel like the Iraq War was kind of a setup, you know? There were reasons they gave us, but looking back…  \n\nThe Bush administration kept saying that the Iraq War was connected to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, and that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, that was all a bunch of lies. And that really grinds my gears.  \n\nHonestly, it just feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just straight-up wrong. It's like, they didn't care about the Constitution, they just wanted to go to war.\n\nI think they came into office with the goal of going to war already set in stone. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book saying that? He was probably pushed out of his job, but it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he wanted to control more of the oil supply, too. Pretty shady, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause a huge mess, though. There's a good chance Iraq would fall into civil war and even more people would die. \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries in the area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to help restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could cause even more problems down the road because Iraq's independence would be a huge issue. \n\nThe news says the Parliament isn't really working, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have a lot of power. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party has a bunch of seats in Parliament now! There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's all pretty chaotic.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't officially declared a war, you know? It felt more like a \"get back\" at Iraq because they were blamed for 9/11. Honestly, I'm not really up-to-date on all the details. I guess the idea is to build a democracy there, like another America, and maybe get some oil while we're at it. But it's just causing a lot of anger and resentment, and staying there isn't really solving anything.\n\nIt's a tough situation. If we leave, they'll be upset because they feel like we abandoned them after messing things up. But if we stay, it'll take forever to build a stable democracy, and it might not even work.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing is really complicated. I feel bad for the families with loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. But I also think it's costing us a lot of resources and making us look bad on the world stage. It's like the Vietnam War; it was an undeclared war that ended up being called meaningless.  I worry that this will be remembered as another one of those.",
            "I strongly believe it's wrong for the government to make laws about this issue. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices would go against that principle. \n\nIt feels like those pushing to make it illegal are simply favoring one church's beliefs over others.  Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution, allowing for religious freedom in the United States. Even discussing a potential amendment on this topic feels wrong, because it contradicts what's already established.  It would be one of the few amendments aimed at restricting people rather than the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The person pushing for this amendment seems to be motivated by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it appears he's favoring one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide these matters, not the president or any government official. There's no real justification for this amendment besides personal views.\n\nI don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or society. It might even have a positive effect.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11, and that's how the invasion started in 2003.  \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes.  \n\nThis war feels a lot like Vietnam in many ways, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. \n\nThe US was trying to put in a new democratic government, kind of like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to push back against communism.  But the government should have known it wouldn't be a quick, clear victory. It was more of a loss in Vietnam, and it's playing out the same way here.  \n\nNo matter how many people might support the US, there will always be insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nSo, I think the government should have never gotten involved in the first place. But if they had to, they needed to be fully prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there at the end of 2006, with American troops still dying, and they're struggling to train Iraqi forces. \n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a simple mission, but building a new government takes a lot of time and effort.  Look at our own history – democracy took a long fight to establish.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough situation. It's hard to walk away after we've been there so long. We took their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a democratic Iraq?\n\nIt makes you wonder why it's just Iraq. Why aren't we doing the same for other countries? It feels like it's all about the oil, and the control it gives us.  Remember the whole \"weapons of mass destruction\" thing? We never found them, yet we haven't done anything about North Korea, which we know has them. \n\nIt makes you question if the government is being truthful in their decisions. All I can hope for is a peaceful resolution soon.",
            "Let me tell you, I’m all for gay marriage. Always have been.  I truly believe it’s a personal choice, something that science is increasingly showing has a biological basis rather than being purely a social construct.  It just seems wrong to limit someone’s rights based on something they can’t control. It feels inhumane, you know? I’ve been a strong supporter of gay marriage for a long time.\n\nTo me, politics and government shouldn’t have a say in this at all. It’s about personal relationships, about families.  Right here in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren’t married because they can’t be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, being neighbors.  But it’s frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to dictate what marriage means, playing God with the very definition of it.  It’s ridiculous, if you ask me.\n\nI’ve read and heard from a lot of sources – news articles, TV reports, you name it – that being gay might have a biological component. It could be something you’re predisposed to, like a chemical makeup in your brain, rather than something you choose based on your upbringing or environment. That’s the biological side, as opposed to the sociological side.\n\nBeyond the ethical implications, there’s this whole public vs. private thing.  A straight couple can get married quietly, no fuss. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news. It shouldn't be this public spectacle. It should be a personal, private matter, not something the government gets to control.",
            "When you share something online, it's essentially in a public space.  Think of it like a town square where everyone can see and read what you post. As a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand how what people put online can impact others' perceptions of them. If you're talking about harmful things like violence or explosions, someone's likely to take notice and react.  \n\nThe internet reaches a vast audience – if you're friends with someone on MySpace, they'll see your bulletin.  Someone might bring something they saw online to the attention of the school, and they have a responsibility to investigate. They can't ignore a potential threat, even if it seems like a joke.\n\nOf course, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes people just goof around.  Maybe it was a harmless experiment for a sociology class that went awry. But sometimes, what seems like a joke can become serious, especially in light of a recent incident. \n\nThink of it this way: if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it online. You can't control how people interpret your words, but you can control what you share. It's a matter of personal responsibility.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friend-requesting their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a duty to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone has shared it publicly.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. I don't believe teachers should create fake social media accounts to befriend their students, as that crosses a line.  Personally, I wouldn't want to know what my residents are doing on their social media accounts, as it's not my place to monitor their personal lives.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long.  Initially, I thought the goal was noble – to bring democracy to a country that lacked fair political systems. However, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power on the world stage.  There were also questions about the motives from the beginning, especially regarding any past issues between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the goal truly was to establish democracy in a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But I think our reasons have become muddled over time. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a clear victory to justify our continued involvement.\n\nThe war lasted for months and years beyond what was initially needed to make a statement. At some point, the Iraqi government and its people need to take responsibility for their own future. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict while neglecting our own pressing issues here at home, like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare.  \n\nSpending so much on a war that has lost its purpose is draining our economy. We should be investing in our own citizens and addressing the problems within our own borders.  It's simply not right to continue sacrificing our own people for a war that no longer serves a clear purpose.",
            "So, I'm thinking about this thing where someone found information on Myspace and was able to stop something bad from happening.  I get that it's a good thing, you know, saving a life and all. But it makes me wonder, is it okay to look through people's profiles like that? Like, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right? So if you're friends with someone, isn't that kind of giving them permission to see your stuff? I mean, once you put something online, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  \n\nIt's a tough situation. You can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, but it also seems wrong to just randomly look at people's stuff.  It feels like discrimination if they're only looking at certain people's profiles, like the \"bad kids.\"\n\nI'm a little creeped out by the idea that people can find out so much about me online. I know there are weird people out there who look through profiles and stuff. I saw this thing on TV where this guy figured out a girl's screen name and started IMing her in less than a minute. It made me think, how much do we really know about the people we're \"friends\" with online?\n\nI try to be careful about what I put on Facebook, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\n\nI also heard that some high schools banned Myspace. That seems weird to me. Like, how can they tell kids they can't have Myspace? Isn't that kind of invading their privacy?",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else was already against it from the start. But honestly, it doesn't really matter now. It's pretty clear that the war was a bad idea, except maybe to the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls –  Americans, Iraqis, even people all around the world think it was a mistake.  A lot of the U.S. troops over there agree, too. They think we should pull out within a year.\n\nLooking back, the whole thing has been a disaster. It was already a mess before we got involved, and pulling out is going to be tough too.  The Middle East is a complicated place, and there's a huge gap between American culture and the culture there. It seems like the U.S. government just wants to force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about the consequences is never the answer. It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The government might have some ideas, but I haven't heard anything that makes sense. If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but it just feels like we should leave now.  \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a lot of them want us to leave immediately. Those are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least they made the decision. If things go bad, we can say we were going to stay, but they asked us to leave.  Maybe that makes us the good guys in the end, even if we're never truly good guys in the Middle East.  At least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the US. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in.  Women face a \"glass ceiling\" where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, a lot of people still struggle with the idea of having a woman as their boss. This is because society has always been this way, and it takes time to change. So, a woman might be perfectly qualified for a job, but the people making the hiring decisions might not choose her because they picture someone else in that position – someone who's male. \n\nThe same goes for men in some fields, like being a stay-at-home parent. It's not common to see dads staying home, and people often look down on it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they might question why a man isn't working if he's at home. This can be tough for those dads who truly want to raise their kids and whose wives might be the ones earning the income. \n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Men who are interested in fashion can sometimes be dismissed because people assume they don't really understand women's fashion. It's like they have to prove themselves more because their interests don't fit the stereotype.\n\nOverall, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in the US, and it varies depending on what field you're in. Change is happening, though. More women are reaching high positions, and more men are embracing their roles as stay-at-home dads. But it's a slow process. It's important to keep pushing for equality, but also to do it in a way that doesn't feel forced. We need to highlight the qualities of those who are often stereotyped and let people see that they deserve respect and recognition for their talents and skills",
            "So basically, instead of making marijuana illegal, they decided to decriminalize it. This means it's not a crime anymore, more like a traffic ticket.  You get a citation instead of being arrested, booked, and hauled into court.  \n\nThere are still some worries about the downsides, though. Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews could still be affected by a marijuana citation. It's a big deal for a lot of people, especially young folks.\n\nBut on the other hand, getting people arrested and processed for marijuana is really expensive for everyone.  Think about it: police time, court costs, lawyers, jail time... it all adds up.  \n\nSome cities are strapped for cash and see decriminalization as a way to save money. They could use that money for things like schools, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, seem to be doing alright with decriminalization. They're probably using the money saved to help their community.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about what would happen if marijuana were fully legalized.  Would it be sold everywhere, like cigarettes?  Would people be smoking it while driving? It's still considered a bit taboo in a lot of places, so that could be awkward.\n\nIt's tricky to compare marijuana and alcohol. Alcohol might be worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with a person's life in other ways. \n\nIt all depends on the person. Some people can handle any substance in moderation, while others struggle. There's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to drugs.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do seems really traditional. They've been doing things the same way for ages, and it's good to have strong roots in tradition.  But it's also important to be able to change with the times. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Honestly, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't seem very welcoming to people who aren't exactly \"perfect Catholics,\" and they don't really accept people of other religions either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very tolerant to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic value, but it seems hypocritical to say you love people and then not accept them.\n\nSo, it feels like a lot of Catholic teaching tells you to do one thing, but the actual practice goes against it because it's so old-fashioned. They just keep doing things the same way.\n\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily solve everything. I personally think it would be good, but I don't think it would stop pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue.\n\nThe people who abuse children would probably do it regardless of whether they were married or not because they're targeting children, which is different from a spouse. \n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent these things from happening; they would probably still happen.",
            "I'm still figuring things out on this whole marriage equality debate. It's tough because it touches on such sensitive issues like separating church and state and figuring out what marriage really means.  I don't think it's easy to address this topic without upsetting people.  It feels like a real balancing act.  \n\nPersonally, I think civil unions are a good starting point. Maybe we shouldn't let the government define what constitutes a \"marriage\" since it's often seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't treat baptisms or other religious ceremonies in a specific way. If you're in a civil union, it's simply two people who have committed to each other. The government shouldn't get involved in the \"what kind of marriage\" conversation, just recognize the union.\n\nI think if all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment feels wrong.  It's just too big of a deal to change the Constitution over something like this. There are important issues that deserve that kind of attention.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. I have many gay friends, and while I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each state individually, not the president.\n\nThink about it: some states lean Democratic, others Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're kind of accepting their stance. \n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, I think legalization should be left to the states.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It shouldn't be up to him to decide for the whole country, especially since he doesn't live in every state. States should have the autonomy to decide what's best for their residents. Plus, with Bush leaving office soon, a Democratic president could overturn the ban, creating constant back-and-forth. It's better to let each state make its own decision and live with the consequences.",
            "I don't think posting things on Myspace is private. It's like a bulletin board, open for anyone to see, including school officials. If you're putting something on the internet, you have to realize that people might see it, even if they aren't looking for trouble.\n\nI get that they shouldn't be constantly snooping, but if seeing something online helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, I think it's okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and if that means looking online sometimes, I think it's justified.\n\nIt's like if they find out students are drinking or smoking through their Myspace pages. That's not cool, but I understand why they'd want to stop those things.\n\nIt's just like emails – you shouldn't write things on emails you wouldn't want anyone else to see. Everything online can come back to bite you later. Once it's out there, it's out there forever.\n\nI think it's a bit different if they're specifically trying to catch students doing something wrong, but if they stumble across something that could prevent a tragedy, then they should absolutely act on it. Parents drop their kids off at school expecting it to be a safe place, and the school has to do everything it can to make sure that's the case. Just like with lockdown drills and security measures after 9/11, they're just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, after 9/11, I was totally on board. I was so affected personally that I wanted revenge, you know?  I felt like we should go in there and make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We didn't really think things through, we just jumped in unprepared and without a plan. \n\nHonestly, I think it backfired. I don't think it achieved anything. If anything, it just made things worse. It's like, those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  It's hard for me to care about what's going on there. They can't even get along with each other, so why should we be trying to fix their problems? \n\nI know 9/11 was a huge deal, but  I just don't think we were ready for what we were walking into. It's not like war here, it's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making things better, they just want us out. Honestly, I think we should just leave. \n\nI think it was mostly anger and revenge that drove us to go to war. I think President Bush felt like he had to do something, and the people wanted action. But we should have thought it through more. We didn't have a clear plan for what we were going to do, and there wasn't any unity on what our goals were.\n\nAnd I think we're fooling ourselves if we think we can change them. They're just going to keep fighting, no matter what we do.  I think we're hurting ourselves more than we're helping them.  We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there.  It's just going to collapse again once we leave, and we can't stay there forever."
