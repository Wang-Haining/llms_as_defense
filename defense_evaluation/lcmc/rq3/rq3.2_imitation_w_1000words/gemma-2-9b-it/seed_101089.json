            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes, especially in how they view certain issues.  I've heard that the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these topics, and while that's understandable, their stances feel a bit outdated.\n\nIf they were more open to modern ways of thinking, I think they wouldn't have to worry as much about losing people.  Many people are starting to disagree with the Church's views on these subjects, particularly when it comes to things like abortion and gay marriage.  Someone who believes in those things might not feel comfortable in a community that condemns them. For example, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel welcome in a Church that considers it completely wrong. Same goes for those who support gay marriage.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  I'm not sure if those changes would have prevented past scandals, but it seems like a reasonable idea.\n\nThe Church says priests are \"married\" to God and devote their lives to Him, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I believe people shouldn't be judged for who they love, whether they're born that way or not. It's not a choice anyone makes. So, I think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. Honestly, I haven't given this topic a lot of thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.   \n\nI think being gay is just part of who a person is, like being straight. People aren't choosing to be gay, it's how they're born. It's not right to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI also don't think the federal government should be involved. It's not a legal or moral issue, in my opinion. I don't think it's appropriate for the government to dictate who can and can't marry. It's a personal matter.\n\nIt just seems wrong to me to treat gay people differently or make them feel like they've made a wrong choice.  They should be treated equally and allowed to live their lives how they choose.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's not a solid reason against it.  Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's totally different.  Think of it like two sides of the same coin, heads and tails are different, but they're still connected.  Gay relationships are similar to straight ones, with the same hopes, dreams, and challenges.   \n\nThere are also important rights at stake.  For example, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital, because they aren't legally recognized as family. That seems unfair if you're committed to spending your life with someone.  \n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work: love, communication, and support.  It's about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nThe core issue is that people often get hung up on the idea of a religious ceremony. Gay couples aren't demanding a church wedding, they're asking for a legal document from the government: a marriage certificate.  If we separate church and state, then this shouldn't be a problem. It's like saying you can't have a civil union because it goes against your religion, but then you're okay with a marriage license. It's \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nI hear worries about adoption and community impact, especially about how kids raised by gay parents will be treated.  But ultimately, loving parents raise happy, well-adjusted kids, regardless of their sexual orientation. It's about good parenting, not about who the parents are.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about basic equality. President Bush has strong beliefs about this issue, which seem connected to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Many arguments against gay marriage are based on religion, but morality is subjective and changes over time. Forcing one group's beliefs on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when we have a pledge of allegiance that includes \"under God\" yet oppose religious influence in government.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or caused by childhood trauma, but the American Psychological Association has debunked that myth.  It's important to rely on science and research, not just personal opinions or cultural norms. If we all listened to experts and challenged our biases, the world would be a better place.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Take marijuana, for example.  It's illegal, but I think people should be able to use it for medical reasons. I'm not saying everyone should be smoking weed, but if it can help someone, why not?  It's not like those strong painkillers, like oxycodone, Vicodin, or Percocet, which are totally legal even though they can be addictive.  I see how those are helpful, so why not give marijuana a chance?  I think people get hung up on the stigma around marijuana, but it's not as harmful as everyone makes it out to be.  It's not like heroin or cocaine.  It wouldn't hurt to at least explore its potential benefits, especially for medical use. \n\nMaybe we should make it legal gradually, so people can learn to use it responsibly.  If we just keep demonizing it, it'll always be associated with bad things.  If we could change that image, maybe people would be more open to using it safely and for good.",
            "I think the Catholic Church has changed to fit modern times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on weekends.  Now that I'm older, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.\n\nI think that's the biggest change I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know about the church's internal politics, but that's the main thing that stands out to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have stopped it. Some married men become pedophiles too, and their attraction to young children isn't caused by their marital status. It's the person, not their relationship status.\n\nBecoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions that allow priests to marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different religion.",
            "(laughs)\nYou know, at first, I was okay with the idea of the Iraq War, but I think everyone was still shaken up from the 9/11 attacks. It felt like we went into Iraq with a bunch of justifications that didn't quite add up. The Bush administration kept tying the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We now know that was all a lie.  That really bugs me, and the whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people, and they've never admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence when he was presenting it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power. It's almost like an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that.  I think the Bush administration has completely disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who basically said that in his book after he got pushed out of his job. Seems like the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably wanted to control Iraq's oil, too.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nLook, I think the war has gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably create chaos, though, and more people would die.  There's this idea now of a coalition of countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try and restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause even more problems because it'll mess with Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe news reports say that the Iraqi Parliament isn't really working. The Prime Minister doesn't seem to have any real power, and this guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, now has at least 20 seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different radical groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of tension.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting into some pretty sensitive stuff.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't even officially declared. It feels like it was just retaliation for 9/11, like we were trying to get back at Iraq because they were thought to be responsible.  I'm not really knowledgeable about the details of the war, but it seems like we're staying there to try and build a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. state, and also to access their oil. But staying there just makes everyone angry. \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be upset because things will be in chaos. It's a really tough situation. \n\nHonestly, I'm not even sure how I feel about it. I think maybe it's better to stay and try to help, but it's also wasting our resources and making our president look bad. \n\nIt's like the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now seen as meaningless. I worry that this war will be remembered the same way.  \n\nThere are families with sons and daughters in Iraq, and I want them to come home safe, but at the same time, we've disrupted their lives and culture. We're trying to force our way of life on them, which could make things worse and fuel more hatred towards the U.S. \n\nThis whole situation is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "I really don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's plainly written, and I feel that trying to enforce any kind of control over it would be going against what's already been established in the Constitution.  So, when people try to make it illegal, I think they're favoring one church's beliefs over others. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in some areas like Boston.  But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution and what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they were considering making an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. Like I said, his push for this amendment shows that he prefers one religion over others. I truly feel that it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason to support this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  I don't think the government was totally honest with us about why we went to war. They tried to tie it to 9/11, even though those two things weren't really connected. It felt like they were trying to use our anger after the attacks to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\n Personally, I'm against war, especially starting wars preemptively.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from our mistakes there. \n\nSo many American soldiers have died. They went in and just overthrew the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for what would happen next. They didn't understand the power vacuum and the chaos that would follow. They basically tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, but it's  a long and tough process. \n\nYou can't just force democracy on a country. It takes time, and it's messy. They made it seem like it would be a quick win, but it hasn't been. We've been there for years, and American troops are still dying. We're still trying to train Iraqi police and soldiers to take control of their own country. \n\n It's a tough situation.  We've been there so long, how can we just leave now?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for this?  And honestly, it feels like this was more about oil than about democracy.  We knew Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we haven't found any. Yet we're not doing anything about other countries with WMDs, like North Korea.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq someday.",
            "Let me tell you, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I truly believe it's a personal preference, something that science is increasingly showing might even have a biological basis rather than being just a social construct. It just doesn't seem right to deny people rights based on something they can't control.  It feels downright inhumane to me.  \n\nI've always championed the cause of gay marriage. Politics and government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens within families and communities.  \n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking dogs, going about their day. They're just like everyone else.\n\nIt's frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to play God and define marriage in a way that suits his beliefs. To me, it's completely ridiculous.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that research suggests being gay might be linked to things happening in our brains, a biological predisposition rather than something learned from our environment. It's not about growing up with lots of sisters or a missing father figure. It's about who you are.\n\nThe whole situation is just strange. A couple can get married without anyone knowing if they're a man and a woman, but if it's two men or two women, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news.  It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's constantly in the public eye and debated on a national level.",

They can't ignore it, because what if something actually happens?\n\nOn the other hand, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not. Sometimes people joke around online, which can lead to misunderstandings. It could be a class project gone wrong, but it could also be something truly dangerous.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked at the student's Facebook, they found things that seemed concerning. What was meant as a joke could be taken seriously given the situation.\n\nWhen you post online, there's no real privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it or take it seriously. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI don't think they should be monitoring phone calls, texts, or instant messages unless something specific is brought to their attention.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles to befriend students. That's just as invasive. As an RA, I don't want to know what my residents are doing in their personal lives. I don't want to see their pictures of them drinking or partying on Facebook. It's not my place to know, and I don't want that kind of connection.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on way too long.  At the beginning, I thought the goal was good – to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, to prove we're a superpower. I also think the original reasons for going to war might have been questionable, considering the history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason. But I don't think that's the case anymore.  \n\nIt feels like our purpose has become muddled over time. It's like we're still at war just to be at war, desperate for a decisive victory. I believe we made our point in the first few months, but it's been years, and it just feels excessive. \n\nHonestly, at this point, their government and officials need to figure things out on their own. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while neglecting our own problems here at home – poverty, failing infrastructure, healthcare – things that desperately need funding. It's a drain on our economy, and the money could be better spent elsewhere. \n\nWe don't need to be at war forever. There comes a point where we need to step back and let other countries handle their own affairs. We have our own issues to address, and it's time to focus on them.",
            "Can I ask a question to make sure I understand?  Uh, it was stopped because someone looked online and found that there was, like, some concerning information?\n\nOkay.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. And I get that on Myspace you need someone else to be a member to see your profile. You might need to be friends with them or something. But if that's the case, you've already given that person permission to see your profile. So,\n\nanyway, anytime you put something on the internet, you should know a lot of people will see it. So, if I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHmm.\n\nUm, that's tough. Because, obviously, you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something bad. But then it becomes discriminatory if they start targeting \"bad kids\" and looking through their profiles.\n\nUm, I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it depends on the situation. Like, did they stumble across the information randomly, or were they actively looking for evidence that someone was planning something? I don't really know.\n\nSure. Um, well, I don't use Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do worry that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this guy who just wanted to show how easy it was to get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and started IM-ing her. He got her to meet him in less than a minute. And, personally, I definitely wouldn't meet with someone like that.  But I've had people in my classes I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and know it's me. It's creepy because they know your interests, what you look like, sometimes even your class schedule. They know where you are during the day and who your friends are. They see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point of having a Facebook is to communicate with friends. I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. But you never really know who can see what.\n\nHmm.\n\nUh, well, I heard my roommate talking about how her high school had a problem with students having Myspace, and they banned it. That seemed a little strange to me. I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace.  \n\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how they had the right to tell people they couldn't. That's the only other thought I have.",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War. I hate to just jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start. But, honestly, it's pretty clear now that it was a bad idea.  It seems like everyone agrees, except maybe those in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  Look at the polls – in the US, Iraq, and around the world, 75 to 80% of people think the war was a mistake.  Even a lot of the American troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nIt just feels like a complete disaster, from before we even went in to now.  Pulling out will probably be a disaster too,  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's just such a clash of cultures – the US and the Middle East are so different.  I think our government has this idea that they can just impose democracy on a place where it doesn't naturally fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country that's going to turn into a mess like this feels wrong.  It's like quicksand.  I honestly don't know what to say about it.  There doesn't seem to be any good reason to stay there any longer.  \n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful plans for why staying is better, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that, but just staying feels wrong.  \n\nIt's crazy to me that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave! Maybe they know best.  If we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then we can't really blame ourselves if things go wrong afterwards.  At least we'll be able to say we tried to do what they wanted.  We might not ever be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It seems to depend on the specific field you're in. For example, women often face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposedly a thing, men might struggle to work under a female boss because of how society's been shaped for so long. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not promote her because historically, it's not common to see women in leadership roles.  \n\nIt's similar for men, though. Think about fields like fashion or staying home as a parent. It's unusual to see a stay-at-home dad. People often judge that because society expects men to be the breadwinners.  It can be tough on them if they want to be the primary caregiver while their wife works, even if it works well for their family. \n\nIn the fashion industry, straight men sometimes face skepticism because people assume they don't \"get\" fashion since it's often associated with a particular lifestyle. It's like, \"How can you know what women want if you don't live like us?\" \n\nSo, it really depends on the industry. I think there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S., but it's changing slowly. Women are taking on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. \n\nIt's all about pushing forward gradually. If we try to force change too quickly, people will resist. We've made progress, and we just need to keep going at this pace.",
            "So, they didn't actually legalize it, they decriminalized it.  That means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited instead of arrested and hauled in.  I think if someone gets caught and cited, they still face those job interview problems and other downsides that come with a drug charge, even though it's not as serious.  A lot of people worry about those future consequences, especially kids. But at the same time, think about how much money it costs to arrest, book, and hold people, plus all the court appearances and public defenders.  It's a ton of money!  Municipalities with financial problems might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it frees up funds for things like schools, social programs, and food banks.  Some communities are just against marijuana, no matter what. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's fine. They probably have more money now to spend on important things.  It's important because we don't want marijuana to be everywhere, like cigarettes sold in gas stations.  People smoking everywhere would be a mess. Plus, it's still kind of taboo in many places, so it would be awkward to see it so readily available.  I'm not sure about the volume, but I think alcohol is worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with people's lives more.  Both have downsides, but people react differently to substances. Some people are more moderate, while others go overboard.  It's hard to generalize because everyone's different.",
            "You know, I'd say Catholicism has its good points and its bad. \n\n On one hand, they're really rooted in tradition, and that can be a good thing. Traditions give you a sense of history and belonging. But on the other hand, they can be so stuck in their ways.  It feels like they expect everyone to follow their rules perfectly, and if you don't, they kinda look down on you. \n\nLike, for example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church just because of his religion. That doesn't seem very loving or accepting to me. \n\nIt's like they preach about loving everyone, but then they don't really practice what they preach. They tell you to do certain things, but then their actions contradict those teachings. It feels outdated and hypocritical. \n\nI think allowing priests to marry could be a good change, but I don't think it would stop those who are going to hurt children from doing so. It's a separate issue altogether. Pedophilia isn't about being married or not. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed in a different way.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out this whole debate about gay marriage.  I don't think either side is completely right or wrong, but it's definitely one of the toughest issues we're facing.  It's so tangled up with the separation of church and state and how we define marriage itself, which is really hard to do without upsetting people.\n\nI think civil unions are a good idea. I'm not sure if the government should define marriage since it's seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't care how people worship or if they're baptized, right?\n\nIf you're married, it should just be treated as a civil union by the government. It's about two people coming together. Whether it's a religious ceremony or not shouldn't matter.\n\nI think if all the states can agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law.  But amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is just crazy.  The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.",
            "You know, growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do believe they should have the right to marry.  I think it's something each state should decide on its own, rather than having the president make a national law about it.\n\nIt seems like states lean either Democratic or Republican, and that naturally influences their stance on gay marriage. Democratic states tend to be more supportive, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're accepting their views. \n\nMy personal feeling is that everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities.  So, allowing states to decide on this issue feels like the fairest approach.\n\nI'm not a fan of the idea of President Bush deciding that the whole country should be against gay marriage. Each state should have the freedom to choose what's right for them. He doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't get to dictate how they run their own affairs.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon, and a Democratic president might lift the ban. It would just create a constantly changing back-and-forth.  It's best to let each state make its own decision, as they're the ones who will ultimately have to live with the consequences.",
            "I don't really agree with that idea.  Myspace is meant to be public, like a bulletin board.  If you post something there, you have to understand people will see it, whether it's the school or not.  \n\nSo, if they found something on there, I think they had a right to see it.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could have easily accessed it from home.\n\nLook, if they're using the internet to stop school shootings, to protect students - that's their job, right?  I think it's okay if it means keeping everyone safe.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids who are drinking or smoking. That feels more like an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, I don't see it as a problem.  \n\nIt's just like how we have to be careful about what we post online in general. Everything is out there forever. You never know when something you said online could come back to bite you later. It's just how the world works now.\n\nI think it's like this: if you're posting something on Myspace and don't want anyone to see it, don't post it!\n\nIt's my opinion that if it helps keep the school safe, like what happened in those drills we did after 9/11, then it's worth it. Parents want to drop their kids off at school and know they're safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war… at first, I was totally on board, especially after 9/11 hit close to home. I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did.  Looking back, though, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without really thinking things through, unprepared and without a solid plan. It feels like it backfired in a big way.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm totally against it. I don't think it's accomplished anything. It seems like those people over there are too busy fighting each other to actually hurt us. I mean, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nHonestly, 9/11 kind of numbed me to what's happening over there. I just don't care anymore. I feel like they're not even human sometimes, just constantly fighting and tearing each other apart. They can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went into the war unprepared. We didn't know what to expect, and war for them is different than it is for us. It's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay.   \n\nI think we were just hyped up and looking for revenge. President Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because the people wanted it after 9/11.  I understand where he was coming from – we couldn't just let them get away with it. But I think we could have found a better way.\n\nWe didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we were there, and there wasn't much unity. It felt like we were just going in blindly. That's probably why we haven't made much progress.  I think we went in with a lot of emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's our place to change those people. They've always been like this, and I doubt anything will ever change. I don't see the point of staying there forever.  We're not making enough progress, and it's probably just hurting us more than helping."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes, especially in how they view certain issues.  I've heard that the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these topics, and while that's understandable, their stances feel a bit outdated.\n\nIf they were more open to modern ways of thinking, I think they wouldn't have to worry as much about losing people.  Many people are starting to disagree with the Church's views on these subjects, particularly when it comes to things like abortion and gay marriage.  Someone who believes in those things might not feel comfortable in a community that condemns them. For example, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel welcome in a Church that considers it completely wrong. Same goes for those who support gay marriage.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  I'm not sure if those changes would have prevented past scandals, but it seems like a reasonable idea.\n\nThe Church says priests are \"married\" to God and devote their lives to Him, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I believe people shouldn't be judged for who they love, whether they're born that way or not. It's not a choice anyone makes. So, I think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. Honestly, I haven't given this topic a lot of thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.   \n\nI think being gay is just part of who a person is, like being straight. People aren't choosing to be gay, it's how they're born. It's not right to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI also don't think the federal government should be involved. It's not a legal or moral issue, in my opinion. I don't think it's appropriate for the government to dictate who can and can't marry. It's a personal matter.\n\nIt just seems wrong to me to treat gay people differently or make them feel like they've made a wrong choice.  They should be treated equally and allowed to live their lives how they choose.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's not a solid reason against it.  Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's totally different.  Think of it like two sides of the same coin, heads and tails are different, but they're still connected.  Gay relationships are similar to straight ones, with the same hopes, dreams, and challenges.   \n\nThere are also important rights at stake.  For example, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital, because they aren't legally recognized as family. That seems unfair if you're committed to spending your life with someone.  \n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work: love, communication, and support.  It's about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nThe core issue is that people often get hung up on the idea of a religious ceremony. Gay couples aren't demanding a church wedding, they're asking for a legal document from the government: a marriage certificate.  If we separate church and state, then this shouldn't be a problem. It's like saying you can't have a civil union because it goes against your religion, but then you're okay with a marriage license. It's \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nI hear worries about adoption and community impact, especially about how kids raised by gay parents will be treated.  But ultimately, loving parents raise happy, well-adjusted kids, regardless of their sexual orientation. It's about good parenting, not about who the parents are.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about basic equality. President Bush has strong beliefs about this issue, which seem connected to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Many arguments against gay marriage are based on religion, but morality is subjective and changes over time. Forcing one group's beliefs on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when we have a pledge of allegiance that includes \"under God\" yet oppose religious influence in government.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or caused by childhood trauma, but the American Psychological Association has debunked that myth.  It's important to rely on science and research, not just personal opinions or cultural norms. If we all listened to experts and challenged our biases, the world would be a better place.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Take marijuana, for example.  It's illegal, but I think people should be able to use it for medical reasons. I'm not saying everyone should be smoking weed, but if it can help someone, why not?  It's not like those strong painkillers, like oxycodone, Vicodin, or Percocet, which are totally legal even though they can be addictive.  I see how those are helpful, so why not give marijuana a chance?  I think people get hung up on the stigma around marijuana, but it's not as harmful as everyone makes it out to be.  It's not like heroin or cocaine.  It wouldn't hurt to at least explore its potential benefits, especially for medical use. \n\nMaybe we should make it legal gradually, so people can learn to use it responsibly.  If we just keep demonizing it, it'll always be associated with bad things.  If we could change that image, maybe people would be more open to using it safely and for good.",
            "I think the Catholic Church has changed to fit modern times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on weekends.  Now that I'm older, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.\n\nI think that's the biggest change I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know about the church's internal politics, but that's the main thing that stands out to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have stopped it. Some married men become pedophiles too, and their attraction to young children isn't caused by their marital status. It's the person, not their relationship status.\n\nBecoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions that allow priests to marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different religion.",
            "(laughs)\nYou know, at first, I was okay with the idea of the Iraq War, but I think everyone was still shaken up from the 9/11 attacks. It felt like we went into Iraq with a bunch of justifications that didn't quite add up. The Bush administration kept tying the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We now know that was all a lie.  That really bugs me, and the whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people, and they've never admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence when he was presenting it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power. It's almost like an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that.  I think the Bush administration has completely disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who basically said that in his book after he got pushed out of his job. Seems like the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably wanted to control Iraq's oil, too.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nLook, I think the war has gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably create chaos, though, and more people would die.  There's this idea now of a coalition of countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try and restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause even more problems because it'll mess with Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe news reports say that the Iraqi Parliament isn't really working. The Prime Minister doesn't seem to have any real power, and this guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, now has at least 20 seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different radical groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of tension.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting into some pretty sensitive stuff.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't even officially declared. It feels like it was just retaliation for 9/11, like we were trying to get back at Iraq because they were thought to be responsible.  I'm not really knowledgeable about the details of the war, but it seems like we're staying there to try and build a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. state, and also to access their oil. But staying there just makes everyone angry. \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be upset because things will be in chaos. It's a really tough situation. \n\nHonestly, I'm not even sure how I feel about it. I think maybe it's better to stay and try to help, but it's also wasting our resources and making our president look bad. \n\nIt's like the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now seen as meaningless. I worry that this war will be remembered the same way.  \n\nThere are families with sons and daughters in Iraq, and I want them to come home safe, but at the same time, we've disrupted their lives and culture. We're trying to force our way of life on them, which could make things worse and fuel more hatred towards the U.S. \n\nThis whole situation is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "I really don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's plainly written, and I feel that trying to enforce any kind of control over it would be going against what's already been established in the Constitution.  So, when people try to make it illegal, I think they're favoring one church's beliefs over others. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in some areas like Boston.  But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution and what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they were considering making an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. Like I said, his push for this amendment shows that he prefers one religion over others. I truly feel that it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason to support this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  I don't think the government was totally honest with us about why we went to war. They tried to tie it to 9/11, even though those two things weren't really connected. It felt like they were trying to use our anger after the attacks to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\n Personally, I'm against war, especially starting wars preemptively.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from our mistakes there. \n\nSo many American soldiers have died. They went in and just overthrew the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for what would happen next. They didn't understand the power vacuum and the chaos that would follow. They basically tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, but it's  a long and tough process. \n\nYou can't just force democracy on a country. It takes time, and it's messy. They made it seem like it would be a quick win, but it hasn't been. We've been there for years, and American troops are still dying. We're still trying to train Iraqi police and soldiers to take control of their own country. \n\n It's a tough situation.  We've been there so long, how can we just leave now?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for this?  And honestly, it feels like this was more about oil than about democracy.  We knew Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we haven't found any. Yet we're not doing anything about other countries with WMDs, like North Korea.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq someday.",
            "Let me tell you, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I truly believe it's a personal preference, something that science is increasingly showing might even have a biological basis rather than being just a social construct. It just doesn't seem right to deny people rights based on something they can't control.  It feels downright inhumane to me.  \n\nI've always championed the cause of gay marriage. Politics and government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens within families and communities.  \n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking dogs, going about their day. They're just like everyone else.\n\nIt's frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to play God and define marriage in a way that suits his beliefs. To me, it's completely ridiculous.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that research suggests being gay might be linked to things happening in our brains, a biological predisposition rather than something learned from our environment. It's not about growing up with lots of sisters or a missing father figure. It's about who you are.\n\nThe whole situation is just strange. A couple can get married without anyone knowing if they're a man and a woman, but if it's two men or two women, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news.  It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's constantly in the public eye and debated on a national level.",

They can't ignore it, because what if something actually happens?\n\nOn the other hand, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not. Sometimes people joke around online, which can lead to misunderstandings. It could be a class project gone wrong, but it could also be something truly dangerous.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked at the student's Facebook, they found things that seemed concerning. What was meant as a joke could be taken seriously given the situation.\n\nWhen you post online, there's no real privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it or take it seriously. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI don't think they should be monitoring phone calls, texts, or instant messages unless something specific is brought to their attention.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles to befriend students. That's just as invasive. As an RA, I don't want to know what my residents are doing in their personal lives. I don't want to see their pictures of them drinking or partying on Facebook. It's not my place to know, and I don't want that kind of connection.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on way too long.  At the beginning, I thought the goal was good – to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, to prove we're a superpower. I also think the original reasons for going to war might have been questionable, considering the history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason. But I don't think that's the case anymore.  \n\nIt feels like our purpose has become muddled over time. It's like we're still at war just to be at war, desperate for a decisive victory. I believe we made our point in the first few months, but it's been years, and it just feels excessive. \n\nHonestly, at this point, their government and officials need to figure things out on their own. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while neglecting our own problems here at home – poverty, failing infrastructure, healthcare – things that desperately need funding. It's a drain on our economy, and the money could be better spent elsewhere. \n\nWe don't need to be at war forever. There comes a point where we need to step back and let other countries handle their own affairs. We have our own issues to address, and it's time to focus on them.",
            "Can I ask a question to make sure I understand?  Uh, it was stopped because someone looked online and found that there was, like, some concerning information?\n\nOkay.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. And I get that on Myspace you need someone else to be a member to see your profile. You might need to be friends with them or something. But if that's the case, you've already given that person permission to see your profile. So,\n\nanyway, anytime you put something on the internet, you should know a lot of people will see it. So, if I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHmm.\n\nUm, that's tough. Because, obviously, you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something bad. But then it becomes discriminatory if they start targeting \"bad kids\" and looking through their profiles.\n\nUm, I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it depends on the situation. Like, did they stumble across the information randomly, or were they actively looking for evidence that someone was planning something? I don't really know.\n\nSure. Um, well, I don't use Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do worry that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this guy who just wanted to show how easy it was to get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and started IM-ing her. He got her to meet him in less than a minute. And, personally, I definitely wouldn't meet with someone like that.  But I've had people in my classes I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and know it's me. It's creepy because they know your interests, what you look like, sometimes even your class schedule. They know where you are during the day and who your friends are. They see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point of having a Facebook is to communicate with friends. I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. But you never really know who can see what.\n\nHmm.\n\nUh, well, I heard my roommate talking about how her high school had a problem with students having Myspace, and they banned it. That seemed a little strange to me. I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace.  \n\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how they had the right to tell people they couldn't. That's the only other thought I have.",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War. I hate to just jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start. But, honestly, it's pretty clear now that it was a bad idea.  It seems like everyone agrees, except maybe those in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  Look at the polls – in the US, Iraq, and around the world, 75 to 80% of people think the war was a mistake.  Even a lot of the American troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nIt just feels like a complete disaster, from before we even went in to now.  Pulling out will probably be a disaster too,  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's just such a clash of cultures – the US and the Middle East are so different.  I think our government has this idea that they can just impose democracy on a place where it doesn't naturally fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country that's going to turn into a mess like this feels wrong.  It's like quicksand.  I honestly don't know what to say about it.  There doesn't seem to be any good reason to stay there any longer.  \n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful plans for why staying is better, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that, but just staying feels wrong.  \n\nIt's crazy to me that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave! Maybe they know best.  If we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then we can't really blame ourselves if things go wrong afterwards.  At least we'll be able to say we tried to do what they wanted.  We might not ever be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It seems to depend on the specific field you're in. For example, women often face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposedly a thing, men might struggle to work under a female boss because of how society's been shaped for so long. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not promote her because historically, it's not common to see women in leadership roles.  \n\nIt's similar for men, though. Think about fields like fashion or staying home as a parent. It's unusual to see a stay-at-home dad. People often judge that because society expects men to be the breadwinners.  It can be tough on them if they want to be the primary caregiver while their wife works, even if it works well for their family. \n\nIn the fashion industry, straight men sometimes face skepticism because people assume they don't \"get\" fashion since it's often associated with a particular lifestyle. It's like, \"How can you know what women want if you don't live like us?\" \n\nSo, it really depends on the industry. I think there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S., but it's changing slowly. Women are taking on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. \n\nIt's all about pushing forward gradually. If we try to force change too quickly, people will resist. We've made progress, and we just need to keep going at this pace.",
            "So, they didn't actually legalize it, they decriminalized it.  That means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited instead of arrested and hauled in.  I think if someone gets caught and cited, they still face those job interview problems and other downsides that come with a drug charge, even though it's not as serious.  A lot of people worry about those future consequences, especially kids. But at the same time, think about how much money it costs to arrest, book, and hold people, plus all the court appearances and public defenders.  It's a ton of money!  Municipalities with financial problems might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it frees up funds for things like schools, social programs, and food banks.  Some communities are just against marijuana, no matter what. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's fine. They probably have more money now to spend on important things.  It's important because we don't want marijuana to be everywhere, like cigarettes sold in gas stations.  People smoking everywhere would be a mess. Plus, it's still kind of taboo in many places, so it would be awkward to see it so readily available.  I'm not sure about the volume, but I think alcohol is worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with people's lives more.  Both have downsides, but people react differently to substances. Some people are more moderate, while others go overboard.  It's hard to generalize because everyone's different.",
            "You know, I'd say Catholicism has its good points and its bad. \n\n On one hand, they're really rooted in tradition, and that can be a good thing. Traditions give you a sense of history and belonging. But on the other hand, they can be so stuck in their ways.  It feels like they expect everyone to follow their rules perfectly, and if you don't, they kinda look down on you. \n\nLike, for example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church just because of his religion. That doesn't seem very loving or accepting to me. \n\nIt's like they preach about loving everyone, but then they don't really practice what they preach. They tell you to do certain things, but then their actions contradict those teachings. It feels outdated and hypocritical. \n\nI think allowing priests to marry could be a good change, but I don't think it would stop those who are going to hurt children from doing so. It's a separate issue altogether. Pedophilia isn't about being married or not. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed in a different way.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out this whole debate about gay marriage.  I don't think either side is completely right or wrong, but it's definitely one of the toughest issues we're facing.  It's so tangled up with the separation of church and state and how we define marriage itself, which is really hard to do without upsetting people.\n\nI think civil unions are a good idea. I'm not sure if the government should define marriage since it's seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't care how people worship or if they're baptized, right?\n\nIf you're married, it should just be treated as a civil union by the government. It's about two people coming together. Whether it's a religious ceremony or not shouldn't matter.\n\nI think if all the states can agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law.  But amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is just crazy.  The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.",
            "You know, growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do believe they should have the right to marry.  I think it's something each state should decide on its own, rather than having the president make a national law about it.\n\nIt seems like states lean either Democratic or Republican, and that naturally influences their stance on gay marriage. Democratic states tend to be more supportive, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're accepting their views. \n\nMy personal feeling is that everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities.  So, allowing states to decide on this issue feels like the fairest approach.\n\nI'm not a fan of the idea of President Bush deciding that the whole country should be against gay marriage. Each state should have the freedom to choose what's right for them. He doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't get to dictate how they run their own affairs.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon, and a Democratic president might lift the ban. It would just create a constantly changing back-and-forth.  It's best to let each state make its own decision, as they're the ones who will ultimately have to live with the consequences.",
            "I don't really agree with that idea.  Myspace is meant to be public, like a bulletin board.  If you post something there, you have to understand people will see it, whether it's the school or not.  \n\nSo, if they found something on there, I think they had a right to see it.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could have easily accessed it from home.\n\nLook, if they're using the internet to stop school shootings, to protect students - that's their job, right?  I think it's okay if it means keeping everyone safe.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids who are drinking or smoking. That feels more like an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, I don't see it as a problem.  \n\nIt's just like how we have to be careful about what we post online in general. Everything is out there forever. You never know when something you said online could come back to bite you later. It's just how the world works now.\n\nI think it's like this: if you're posting something on Myspace and don't want anyone to see it, don't post it!\n\nIt's my opinion that if it helps keep the school safe, like what happened in those drills we did after 9/11, then it's worth it. Parents want to drop their kids off at school and know they're safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war… at first, I was totally on board, especially after 9/11 hit close to home. I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did.  Looking back, though, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without really thinking things through, unprepared and without a solid plan. It feels like it backfired in a big way.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm totally against it. I don't think it's accomplished anything. It seems like those people over there are too busy fighting each other to actually hurt us. I mean, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nHonestly, 9/11 kind of numbed me to what's happening over there. I just don't care anymore. I feel like they're not even human sometimes, just constantly fighting and tearing each other apart. They can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went into the war unprepared. We didn't know what to expect, and war for them is different than it is for us. It's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay.   \n\nI think we were just hyped up and looking for revenge. President Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because the people wanted it after 9/11.  I understand where he was coming from – we couldn't just let them get away with it. But I think we could have found a better way.\n\nWe didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we were there, and there wasn't much unity. It felt like we were just going in blindly. That's probably why we haven't made much progress.  I think we went in with a lot of emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's our place to change those people. They've always been like this, and I doubt anything will ever change. I don't see the point of staying there forever.  We're not making enough progress, and it's probably just hurting us more than helping."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes, especially in how they view certain issues.  I've heard that the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these topics, and while that's understandable, their stances feel a bit outdated.\n\nIf they were more open to modern ways of thinking, I think they wouldn't have to worry as much about losing people.  Many people are starting to disagree with the Church's views on these subjects, particularly when it comes to things like abortion and gay marriage.  Someone who believes in those things might not feel comfortable in a community that condemns them. For example, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel welcome in a Church that considers it completely wrong. Same goes for those who support gay marriage.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  I'm not sure if those changes would have prevented past scandals, but it seems like a reasonable idea.\n\nThe Church says priests are \"married\" to God and devote their lives to Him, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I believe people shouldn't be judged for who they love, whether they're born that way or not. It's not a choice anyone makes. So, I think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. Honestly, I haven't given this topic a lot of thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.   \n\nI think being gay is just part of who a person is, like being straight. People aren't choosing to be gay, it's how they're born. It's not right to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI also don't think the federal government should be involved. It's not a legal or moral issue, in my opinion. I don't think it's appropriate for the government to dictate who can and can't marry. It's a personal matter.\n\nIt just seems wrong to me to treat gay people differently or make them feel like they've made a wrong choice.  They should be treated equally and allowed to live their lives how they choose.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's not a solid reason against it.  Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's totally different.  Think of it like two sides of the same coin, heads and tails are different, but they're still connected.  Gay relationships are similar to straight ones, with the same hopes, dreams, and challenges.   \n\nThere are also important rights at stake.  For example, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital, because they aren't legally recognized as family. That seems unfair if you're committed to spending your life with someone.  \n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work: love, communication, and support.  It's about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nThe core issue is that people often get hung up on the idea of a religious ceremony. Gay couples aren't demanding a church wedding, they're asking for a legal document from the government: a marriage certificate.  If we separate church and state, then this shouldn't be a problem. It's like saying you can't have a civil union because it goes against your religion, but then you're okay with a marriage license. It's \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nI hear worries about adoption and community impact, especially about how kids raised by gay parents will be treated.  But ultimately, loving parents raise happy, well-adjusted kids, regardless of their sexual orientation. It's about good parenting, not about who the parents are.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about basic equality. President Bush has strong beliefs about this issue, which seem connected to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Many arguments against gay marriage are based on religion, but morality is subjective and changes over time. Forcing one group's beliefs on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when we have a pledge of allegiance that includes \"under God\" yet oppose religious influence in government.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or caused by childhood trauma, but the American Psychological Association has debunked that myth.  It's important to rely on science and research, not just personal opinions or cultural norms. If we all listened to experts and challenged our biases, the world would be a better place.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Take marijuana, for example.  It's illegal, but I think people should be able to use it for medical reasons. I'm not saying everyone should be smoking weed, but if it can help someone, why not?  It's not like those strong painkillers, like oxycodone, Vicodin, or Percocet, which are totally legal even though they can be addictive.  I see how those are helpful, so why not give marijuana a chance?  I think people get hung up on the stigma around marijuana, but it's not as harmful as everyone makes it out to be.  It's not like heroin or cocaine.  It wouldn't hurt to at least explore its potential benefits, especially for medical use. \n\nMaybe we should make it legal gradually, so people can learn to use it responsibly.  If we just keep demonizing it, it'll always be associated with bad things.  If we could change that image, maybe people would be more open to using it safely and for good.",
            "I think the Catholic Church has changed to fit modern times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on weekends.  Now that I'm older, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.\n\nI think that's the biggest change I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know about the church's internal politics, but that's the main thing that stands out to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have stopped it. Some married men become pedophiles too, and their attraction to young children isn't caused by their marital status. It's the person, not their relationship status.\n\nBecoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions that allow priests to marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different religion.",
            "(laughs)\nYou know, at first, I was okay with the idea of the Iraq War, but I think everyone was still shaken up from the 9/11 attacks. It felt like we went into Iraq with a bunch of justifications that didn't quite add up. The Bush administration kept tying the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We now know that was all a lie.  That really bugs me, and the whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people, and they've never admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence when he was presenting it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power. It's almost like an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that.  I think the Bush administration has completely disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who basically said that in his book after he got pushed out of his job. Seems like the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably wanted to control Iraq's oil, too.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nLook, I think the war has gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably create chaos, though, and more people would die.  There's this idea now of a coalition of countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try and restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause even more problems because it'll mess with Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe news reports say that the Iraqi Parliament isn't really working. The Prime Minister doesn't seem to have any real power, and this guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, now has at least 20 seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different radical groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of tension.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting into some pretty sensitive stuff.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't even officially declared. It feels like it was just retaliation for 9/11, like we were trying to get back at Iraq because they were thought to be responsible.  I'm not really knowledgeable about the details of the war, but it seems like we're staying there to try and build a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. state, and also to access their oil. But staying there just makes everyone angry. \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be upset because things will be in chaos. It's a really tough situation. \n\nHonestly, I'm not even sure how I feel about it. I think maybe it's better to stay and try to help, but it's also wasting our resources and making our president look bad. \n\nIt's like the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now seen as meaningless. I worry that this war will be remembered the same way.  \n\nThere are families with sons and daughters in Iraq, and I want them to come home safe, but at the same time, we've disrupted their lives and culture. We're trying to force our way of life on them, which could make things worse and fuel more hatred towards the U.S. \n\nThis whole situation is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "I really don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's plainly written, and I feel that trying to enforce any kind of control over it would be going against what's already been established in the Constitution.  So, when people try to make it illegal, I think they're favoring one church's beliefs over others. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in some areas like Boston.  But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution and what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they were considering making an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. Like I said, his push for this amendment shows that he prefers one religion over others. I truly feel that it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason to support this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  I don't think the government was totally honest with us about why we went to war. They tried to tie it to 9/11, even though those two things weren't really connected. It felt like they were trying to use our anger after the attacks to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\n Personally, I'm against war, especially starting wars preemptively.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from our mistakes there. \n\nSo many American soldiers have died. They went in and just overthrew the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for what would happen next. They didn't understand the power vacuum and the chaos that would follow. They basically tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, but it's  a long and tough process. \n\nYou can't just force democracy on a country. It takes time, and it's messy. They made it seem like it would be a quick win, but it hasn't been. We've been there for years, and American troops are still dying. We're still trying to train Iraqi police and soldiers to take control of their own country. \n\n It's a tough situation.  We've been there so long, how can we just leave now?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for this?  And honestly, it feels like this was more about oil than about democracy.  We knew Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we haven't found any. Yet we're not doing anything about other countries with WMDs, like North Korea.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq someday.",
            "Let me tell you, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I truly believe it's a personal preference, something that science is increasingly showing might even have a biological basis rather than being just a social construct. It just doesn't seem right to deny people rights based on something they can't control.  It feels downright inhumane to me.  \n\nI've always championed the cause of gay marriage. Politics and government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens within families and communities.  \n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking dogs, going about their day. They're just like everyone else.\n\nIt's frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to play God and define marriage in a way that suits his beliefs. To me, it's completely ridiculous.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that research suggests being gay might be linked to things happening in our brains, a biological predisposition rather than something learned from our environment. It's not about growing up with lots of sisters or a missing father figure. It's about who you are.\n\nThe whole situation is just strange. A couple can get married without anyone knowing if they're a man and a woman, but if it's two men or two women, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news.  It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's constantly in the public eye and debated on a national level.",

They can't ignore it, because what if something actually happens?\n\nOn the other hand, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not. Sometimes people joke around online, which can lead to misunderstandings. It could be a class project gone wrong, but it could also be something truly dangerous.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked at the student's Facebook, they found things that seemed concerning. What was meant as a joke could be taken seriously given the situation.\n\nWhen you post online, there's no real privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it or take it seriously. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI don't think they should be monitoring phone calls, texts, or instant messages unless something specific is brought to their attention.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles to befriend students. That's just as invasive. As an RA, I don't want to know what my residents are doing in their personal lives. I don't want to see their pictures of them drinking or partying on Facebook. It's not my place to know, and I don't want that kind of connection.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on way too long.  At the beginning, I thought the goal was good – to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, to prove we're a superpower. I also think the original reasons for going to war might have been questionable, considering the history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason. But I don't think that's the case anymore.  \n\nIt feels like our purpose has become muddled over time. It's like we're still at war just to be at war, desperate for a decisive victory. I believe we made our point in the first few months, but it's been years, and it just feels excessive. \n\nHonestly, at this point, their government and officials need to figure things out on their own. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while neglecting our own problems here at home – poverty, failing infrastructure, healthcare – things that desperately need funding. It's a drain on our economy, and the money could be better spent elsewhere. \n\nWe don't need to be at war forever. There comes a point where we need to step back and let other countries handle their own affairs. We have our own issues to address, and it's time to focus on them.",
            "Can I ask a question to make sure I understand?  Uh, it was stopped because someone looked online and found that there was, like, some concerning information?\n\nOkay.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. And I get that on Myspace you need someone else to be a member to see your profile. You might need to be friends with them or something. But if that's the case, you've already given that person permission to see your profile. So,\n\nanyway, anytime you put something on the internet, you should know a lot of people will see it. So, if I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHmm.\n\nUm, that's tough. Because, obviously, you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something bad. But then it becomes discriminatory if they start targeting \"bad kids\" and looking through their profiles.\n\nUm, I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it depends on the situation. Like, did they stumble across the information randomly, or were they actively looking for evidence that someone was planning something? I don't really know.\n\nSure. Um, well, I don't use Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do worry that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this guy who just wanted to show how easy it was to get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and started IM-ing her. He got her to meet him in less than a minute. And, personally, I definitely wouldn't meet with someone like that.  But I've had people in my classes I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and know it's me. It's creepy because they know your interests, what you look like, sometimes even your class schedule. They know where you are during the day and who your friends are. They see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point of having a Facebook is to communicate with friends. I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. But you never really know who can see what.\n\nHmm.\n\nUh, well, I heard my roommate talking about how her high school had a problem with students having Myspace, and they banned it. That seemed a little strange to me. I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace.  \n\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how they had the right to tell people they couldn't. That's the only other thought I have.",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War. I hate to just jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start. But, honestly, it's pretty clear now that it was a bad idea.  It seems like everyone agrees, except maybe those in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  Look at the polls – in the US, Iraq, and around the world, 75 to 80% of people think the war was a mistake.  Even a lot of the American troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nIt just feels like a complete disaster, from before we even went in to now.  Pulling out will probably be a disaster too,  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's just such a clash of cultures – the US and the Middle East are so different.  I think our government has this idea that they can just impose democracy on a place where it doesn't naturally fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country that's going to turn into a mess like this feels wrong.  It's like quicksand.  I honestly don't know what to say about it.  There doesn't seem to be any good reason to stay there any longer.  \n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful plans for why staying is better, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that, but just staying feels wrong.  \n\nIt's crazy to me that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave! Maybe they know best.  If we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then we can't really blame ourselves if things go wrong afterwards.  At least we'll be able to say we tried to do what they wanted.  We might not ever be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It seems to depend on the specific field you're in. For example, women often face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposedly a thing, men might struggle to work under a female boss because of how society's been shaped for so long. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not promote her because historically, it's not common to see women in leadership roles.  \n\nIt's similar for men, though. Think about fields like fashion or staying home as a parent. It's unusual to see a stay-at-home dad. People often judge that because society expects men to be the breadwinners.  It can be tough on them if they want to be the primary caregiver while their wife works, even if it works well for their family. \n\nIn the fashion industry, straight men sometimes face skepticism because people assume they don't \"get\" fashion since it's often associated with a particular lifestyle. It's like, \"How can you know what women want if you don't live like us?\" \n\nSo, it really depends on the industry. I think there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S., but it's changing slowly. Women are taking on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. \n\nIt's all about pushing forward gradually. If we try to force change too quickly, people will resist. We've made progress, and we just need to keep going at this pace.",
            "So, they didn't actually legalize it, they decriminalized it.  That means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited instead of arrested and hauled in.  I think if someone gets caught and cited, they still face those job interview problems and other downsides that come with a drug charge, even though it's not as serious.  A lot of people worry about those future consequences, especially kids. But at the same time, think about how much money it costs to arrest, book, and hold people, plus all the court appearances and public defenders.  It's a ton of money!  Municipalities with financial problems might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it frees up funds for things like schools, social programs, and food banks.  Some communities are just against marijuana, no matter what. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's fine. They probably have more money now to spend on important things.  It's important because we don't want marijuana to be everywhere, like cigarettes sold in gas stations.  People smoking everywhere would be a mess. Plus, it's still kind of taboo in many places, so it would be awkward to see it so readily available.  I'm not sure about the volume, but I think alcohol is worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with people's lives more.  Both have downsides, but people react differently to substances. Some people are more moderate, while others go overboard.  It's hard to generalize because everyone's different.",
            "You know, I'd say Catholicism has its good points and its bad. \n\n On one hand, they're really rooted in tradition, and that can be a good thing. Traditions give you a sense of history and belonging. But on the other hand, they can be so stuck in their ways.  It feels like they expect everyone to follow their rules perfectly, and if you don't, they kinda look down on you. \n\nLike, for example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church just because of his religion. That doesn't seem very loving or accepting to me. \n\nIt's like they preach about loving everyone, but then they don't really practice what they preach. They tell you to do certain things, but then their actions contradict those teachings. It feels outdated and hypocritical. \n\nI think allowing priests to marry could be a good change, but I don't think it would stop those who are going to hurt children from doing so. It's a separate issue altogether. Pedophilia isn't about being married or not. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed in a different way.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out this whole debate about gay marriage.  I don't think either side is completely right or wrong, but it's definitely one of the toughest issues we're facing.  It's so tangled up with the separation of church and state and how we define marriage itself, which is really hard to do without upsetting people.\n\nI think civil unions are a good idea. I'm not sure if the government should define marriage since it's seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't care how people worship or if they're baptized, right?\n\nIf you're married, it should just be treated as a civil union by the government. It's about two people coming together. Whether it's a religious ceremony or not shouldn't matter.\n\nI think if all the states can agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law.  But amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is just crazy.  The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.",
            "You know, growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do believe they should have the right to marry.  I think it's something each state should decide on its own, rather than having the president make a national law about it.\n\nIt seems like states lean either Democratic or Republican, and that naturally influences their stance on gay marriage. Democratic states tend to be more supportive, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're accepting their views. \n\nMy personal feeling is that everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities.  So, allowing states to decide on this issue feels like the fairest approach.\n\nI'm not a fan of the idea of President Bush deciding that the whole country should be against gay marriage. Each state should have the freedom to choose what's right for them. He doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't get to dictate how they run their own affairs.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon, and a Democratic president might lift the ban. It would just create a constantly changing back-and-forth.  It's best to let each state make its own decision, as they're the ones who will ultimately have to live with the consequences.",
            "I don't really agree with that idea.  Myspace is meant to be public, like a bulletin board.  If you post something there, you have to understand people will see it, whether it's the school or not.  \n\nSo, if they found something on there, I think they had a right to see it.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could have easily accessed it from home.\n\nLook, if they're using the internet to stop school shootings, to protect students - that's their job, right?  I think it's okay if it means keeping everyone safe.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids who are drinking or smoking. That feels more like an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, I don't see it as a problem.  \n\nIt's just like how we have to be careful about what we post online in general. Everything is out there forever. You never know when something you said online could come back to bite you later. It's just how the world works now.\n\nI think it's like this: if you're posting something on Myspace and don't want anyone to see it, don't post it!\n\nIt's my opinion that if it helps keep the school safe, like what happened in those drills we did after 9/11, then it's worth it. Parents want to drop their kids off at school and know they're safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war… at first, I was totally on board, especially after 9/11 hit close to home. I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did.  Looking back, though, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without really thinking things through, unprepared and without a solid plan. It feels like it backfired in a big way.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm totally against it. I don't think it's accomplished anything. It seems like those people over there are too busy fighting each other to actually hurt us. I mean, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nHonestly, 9/11 kind of numbed me to what's happening over there. I just don't care anymore. I feel like they're not even human sometimes, just constantly fighting and tearing each other apart. They can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went into the war unprepared. We didn't know what to expect, and war for them is different than it is for us. It's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay.   \n\nI think we were just hyped up and looking for revenge. President Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because the people wanted it after 9/11.  I understand where he was coming from – we couldn't just let them get away with it. But I think we could have found a better way.\n\nWe didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we were there, and there wasn't much unity. It felt like we were just going in blindly. That's probably why we haven't made much progress.  I think we went in with a lot of emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's our place to change those people. They've always been like this, and I doubt anything will ever change. I don't see the point of staying there forever.  We're not making enough progress, and it's probably just hurting us more than helping."
