            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. They've been noticing a decline in followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of modern ideas.\n\nTake issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong, traditional views on these, which is fine, but they seem a bit outdated. If they were more open to different viewpoints, maybe they wouldn't be losing people.  \n\nI've heard that some folks are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these topics. People are looking for a church that aligns with their own beliefs, especially on things like abortion and gay marriage. If you believe in those things, you might not feel comfortable in a church that condemns them.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a job and a family life. Why shouldn't priests?",
            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage. I think people should be able to marry whoever they love, whether they were born that way or not. It's not like it's a choice someone makes.  It feels wrong to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about it too much, but I think it's unfair to deny people the right to marry just because of who they are. It's like being born straight or gay – it's just part of who you are. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this. It's a personal decision, not something that affects national security or morality. It seems like the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to tell people who they can and can't marry. It's not their place to judge people's relationships.\n\nIt's just not right to treat people differently because of their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be made to feel ashamed or like they made a wrong choice. It's who they are, and that's okay.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There isn't a strong reason against it. Some people worry that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but completely different.  \n\nThere are also lots of civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't always be by your side in the hospital or make decisions for you if you're sick because they aren't legally considered family. That seems unfair if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships are just as successful as heterosexual ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. \n\nWhat people are really arguing about is the legal definition of marriage, not religious ceremonies. Gay couples want a government-issued marriage certificate, not a church blessing.  \n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. They deserve the same rights and recognition. Some people worry about adoption and its impact on children, but studies show no difference in outcomes for children raised by same-sex couples compared to those raised by heterosexual couples.\n\nThe real issue is societal prejudice. Kids of gay parents sometimes face bullying and discrimination, which is heartbreaking. \n\nUltimately, the government should support equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's views on this issue seem heavily influenced by his religion, which is a personal belief that shouldn't dictate policy for everyone. \n\nSome people believe gayness is a psychological disorder, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth. We should trust scientific evidence and challenge harmful stereotypes.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs. Like, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful. I mean, think about it: there are tons of drugs that pharmacies use all the time, even though they're controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. Those are powerful medications, but they're used because they actually help people.  If we're saying marijuana can't be used for medical purposes just because it's illegal, that seems kinda unfair. It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nI know some people think marijuana is a gateway drug and will lead to worse things, but alcohol can be pretty harmful too if you abuse it. It's a tough issue. Maybe the best approach would be to gradually make it legal, so we don't see a huge surge in abuse right away. But first, we need to get rid of the stigma around marijuana. If people don't see it as this scary, dangerous substance, they might be more likely to use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to fit the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now that I'm older, they've started a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see families rushing in from the beach still in their swimsuits. The morning masses, which I used to always dress up for, are now full of people in jeans and khakis. Things are definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other things, like the priest abuse scandals, I don't think allowing women priests or married priests would have prevented those. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's about the individual, not their marital status. I think people choose to become priests, and if they want to be married, they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic, not something people choose. You can't hide that with marriage. It might come out eventually. The church might have covered up some cases, but I don't think they could have stopped it entirely.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were coming from at first, but everyone was still super shaken up after 9/11. I feel like the Iraq War was kind of a setup, you know? There were reasons they gave us, but looking back…  \n\nThe Bush administration kept saying that the Iraq War was connected to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, and that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, that was all a bunch of lies. And that really grinds my gears.  \n\nHonestly, it just feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just straight-up wrong. It's like, they didn't care about the Constitution, they just wanted to go to war.\n\nI think they came into office with the goal of going to war already set in stone. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book saying that? He was probably pushed out of his job, but it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he wanted to control more of the oil supply, too. Pretty shady, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause a huge mess, though. There's a good chance Iraq would fall into civil war and even more people would die. \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries in the area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to help restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could cause even more problems down the road because Iraq's independence would be a huge issue. \n\nThe news says the Parliament isn't really working, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have a lot of power. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party has a bunch of seats in Parliament now! There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's all pretty chaotic.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't officially declared a war, you know? It felt more like a \"get back\" at Iraq because they were blamed for 9/11. Honestly, I'm not really up-to-date on all the details. I guess the idea is to build a democracy there, like another America, and maybe get some oil while we're at it. But it's just causing a lot of anger and resentment, and staying there isn't really solving anything.\n\nIt's a tough situation. If we leave, they'll be upset because they feel like we abandoned them after messing things up. But if we stay, it'll take forever to build a stable democracy, and it might not even work.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing is really complicated. I feel bad for the families with loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. But I also think it's costing us a lot of resources and making us look bad on the world stage. It's like the Vietnam War; it was an undeclared war that ended up being called meaningless.  I worry that this will be remembered as another one of those.",
            "I strongly believe it's wrong for the government to make laws about this issue. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices would go against that principle. \n\nIt feels like those pushing to make it illegal are simply favoring one church's beliefs over others.  Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution, allowing for religious freedom in the United States. Even discussing a potential amendment on this topic feels wrong, because it contradicts what's already established.  It would be one of the few amendments aimed at restricting people rather than the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The person pushing for this amendment seems to be motivated by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it appears he's favoring one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide these matters, not the president or any government official. There's no real justification for this amendment besides personal views.\n\nI don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or society. It might even have a positive effect.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11, and that's how the invasion started in 2003.  \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes.  \n\nThis war feels a lot like Vietnam in many ways, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. \n\nThe US was trying to put in a new democratic government, kind of like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to push back against communism.  But the government should have known it wouldn't be a quick, clear victory. It was more of a loss in Vietnam, and it's playing out the same way here.  \n\nNo matter how many people might support the US, there will always be insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nSo, I think the government should have never gotten involved in the first place. But if they had to, they needed to be fully prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there at the end of 2006, with American troops still dying, and they're struggling to train Iraqi forces. \n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a simple mission, but building a new government takes a lot of time and effort.  Look at our own history – democracy took a long fight to establish.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough situation. It's hard to walk away after we've been there so long. We took their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a democratic Iraq?\n\nIt makes you wonder why it's just Iraq. Why aren't we doing the same for other countries? It feels like it's all about the oil, and the control it gives us.  Remember the whole \"weapons of mass destruction\" thing? We never found them, yet we haven't done anything about North Korea, which we know has them. \n\nIt makes you question if the government is being truthful in their decisions. All I can hope for is a peaceful resolution soon.",
            "Let me tell you, I’m all for gay marriage. Always have been.  I truly believe it’s a personal choice, something that science is increasingly showing has a biological basis rather than being purely a social construct.  It just seems wrong to limit someone’s rights based on something they can’t control. It feels inhumane, you know? I’ve been a strong supporter of gay marriage for a long time.\n\nTo me, politics and government shouldn’t have a say in this at all. It’s about personal relationships, about families.  Right here in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren’t married because they can’t be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, being neighbors.  But it’s frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to dictate what marriage means, playing God with the very definition of it.  It’s ridiculous, if you ask me.\n\nI’ve read and heard from a lot of sources – news articles, TV reports, you name it – that being gay might have a biological component. It could be something you’re predisposed to, like a chemical makeup in your brain, rather than something you choose based on your upbringing or environment. That’s the biological side, as opposed to the sociological side.\n\nBeyond the ethical implications, there’s this whole public vs. private thing.  A straight couple can get married quietly, no fuss. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news. It shouldn't be this public spectacle. It should be a personal, private matter, not something the government gets to control.",
            "When you share something online, it's essentially in a public space.  Think of it like a town square where everyone can see and read what you post. As a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand how what people put online can impact others' perceptions of them. If you're talking about harmful things like violence or explosions, someone's likely to take notice and react.  \n\nThe internet reaches a vast audience – if you're friends with someone on MySpace, they'll see your bulletin.  Someone might bring something they saw online to the attention of the school, and they have a responsibility to investigate. They can't ignore a potential threat, even if it seems like a joke.\n\nOf course, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes people just goof around.  Maybe it was a harmless experiment for a sociology class that went awry. But sometimes, what seems like a joke can become serious, especially in light of a recent incident. \n\nThink of it this way: if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it online. You can't control how people interpret your words, but you can control what you share. It's a matter of personal responsibility.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friend-requesting their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a duty to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone has shared it publicly.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. I don't believe teachers should create fake social media accounts to befriend their students, as that crosses a line.  Personally, I wouldn't want to know what my residents are doing on their social media accounts, as it's not my place to monitor their personal lives.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long.  Initially, I thought the goal was noble – to bring democracy to a country that lacked fair political systems. However, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power on the world stage.  There were also questions about the motives from the beginning, especially regarding any past issues between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the goal truly was to establish democracy in a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But I think our reasons have become muddled over time. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a clear victory to justify our continued involvement.\n\nThe war lasted for months and years beyond what was initially needed to make a statement. At some point, the Iraqi government and its people need to take responsibility for their own future. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict while neglecting our own pressing issues here at home, like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare.  \n\nSpending so much on a war that has lost its purpose is draining our economy. We should be investing in our own citizens and addressing the problems within our own borders.  It's simply not right to continue sacrificing our own people for a war that no longer serves a clear purpose.",
            "So, I'm thinking about this thing where someone found information on Myspace and was able to stop something bad from happening.  I get that it's a good thing, you know, saving a life and all. But it makes me wonder, is it okay to look through people's profiles like that? Like, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right? So if you're friends with someone, isn't that kind of giving them permission to see your stuff? I mean, once you put something online, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  \n\nIt's a tough situation. You can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, but it also seems wrong to just randomly look at people's stuff.  It feels like discrimination if they're only looking at certain people's profiles, like the \"bad kids.\"\n\nI'm a little creeped out by the idea that people can find out so much about me online. I know there are weird people out there who look through profiles and stuff. I saw this thing on TV where this guy figured out a girl's screen name and started IMing her in less than a minute. It made me think, how much do we really know about the people we're \"friends\" with online?\n\nI try to be careful about what I put on Facebook, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\n\nI also heard that some high schools banned Myspace. That seems weird to me. Like, how can they tell kids they can't have Myspace? Isn't that kind of invading their privacy?",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else was already against it from the start. But honestly, it doesn't really matter now. It's pretty clear that the war was a bad idea, except maybe to the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls –  Americans, Iraqis, even people all around the world think it was a mistake.  A lot of the U.S. troops over there agree, too. They think we should pull out within a year.\n\nLooking back, the whole thing has been a disaster. It was already a mess before we got involved, and pulling out is going to be tough too.  The Middle East is a complicated place, and there's a huge gap between American culture and the culture there. It seems like the U.S. government just wants to force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about the consequences is never the answer. It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The government might have some ideas, but I haven't heard anything that makes sense. If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but it just feels like we should leave now.  \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a lot of them want us to leave immediately. Those are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least they made the decision. If things go bad, we can say we were going to stay, but they asked us to leave.  Maybe that makes us the good guys in the end, even if we're never truly good guys in the Middle East.  At least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the US. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in.  Women face a \"glass ceiling\" where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, a lot of people still struggle with the idea of having a woman as their boss. This is because society has always been this way, and it takes time to change. So, a woman might be perfectly qualified for a job, but the people making the hiring decisions might not choose her because they picture someone else in that position – someone who's male. \n\nThe same goes for men in some fields, like being a stay-at-home parent. It's not common to see dads staying home, and people often look down on it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they might question why a man isn't working if he's at home. This can be tough for those dads who truly want to raise their kids and whose wives might be the ones earning the income. \n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Men who are interested in fashion can sometimes be dismissed because people assume they don't really understand women's fashion. It's like they have to prove themselves more because their interests don't fit the stereotype.\n\nOverall, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in the US, and it varies depending on what field you're in. Change is happening, though. More women are reaching high positions, and more men are embracing their roles as stay-at-home dads. But it's a slow process. It's important to keep pushing for equality, but also to do it in a way that doesn't feel forced. We need to highlight the qualities of those who are often stereotyped and let people see that they deserve respect and recognition for their talents and skills",
            "So basically, instead of making marijuana illegal, they decided to decriminalize it. This means it's not a crime anymore, more like a traffic ticket.  You get a citation instead of being arrested, booked, and hauled into court.  \n\nThere are still some worries about the downsides, though. Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews could still be affected by a marijuana citation. It's a big deal for a lot of people, especially young folks.\n\nBut on the other hand, getting people arrested and processed for marijuana is really expensive for everyone.  Think about it: police time, court costs, lawyers, jail time... it all adds up.  \n\nSome cities are strapped for cash and see decriminalization as a way to save money. They could use that money for things like schools, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, seem to be doing alright with decriminalization. They're probably using the money saved to help their community.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about what would happen if marijuana were fully legalized.  Would it be sold everywhere, like cigarettes?  Would people be smoking it while driving? It's still considered a bit taboo in a lot of places, so that could be awkward.\n\nIt's tricky to compare marijuana and alcohol. Alcohol might be worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with a person's life in other ways. \n\nIt all depends on the person. Some people can handle any substance in moderation, while others struggle. There's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to drugs.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do seems really traditional. They've been doing things the same way for ages, and it's good to have strong roots in tradition.  But it's also important to be able to change with the times. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Honestly, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't seem very welcoming to people who aren't exactly \"perfect Catholics,\" and they don't really accept people of other religions either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very tolerant to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic value, but it seems hypocritical to say you love people and then not accept them.\n\nSo, it feels like a lot of Catholic teaching tells you to do one thing, but the actual practice goes against it because it's so old-fashioned. They just keep doing things the same way.\n\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily solve everything. I personally think it would be good, but I don't think it would stop pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue.\n\nThe people who abuse children would probably do it regardless of whether they were married or not because they're targeting children, which is different from a spouse. \n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent these things from happening; they would probably still happen.",
            "I'm still figuring things out on this whole marriage equality debate. It's tough because it touches on such sensitive issues like separating church and state and figuring out what marriage really means.  I don't think it's easy to address this topic without upsetting people.  It feels like a real balancing act.  \n\nPersonally, I think civil unions are a good starting point. Maybe we shouldn't let the government define what constitutes a \"marriage\" since it's often seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't treat baptisms or other religious ceremonies in a specific way. If you're in a civil union, it's simply two people who have committed to each other. The government shouldn't get involved in the \"what kind of marriage\" conversation, just recognize the union.\n\nI think if all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment feels wrong.  It's just too big of a deal to change the Constitution over something like this. There are important issues that deserve that kind of attention.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. I have many gay friends, and while I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each state individually, not the president.\n\nThink about it: some states lean Democratic, others Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're kind of accepting their stance. \n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, I think legalization should be left to the states.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It shouldn't be up to him to decide for the whole country, especially since he doesn't live in every state. States should have the autonomy to decide what's best for their residents. Plus, with Bush leaving office soon, a Democratic president could overturn the ban, creating constant back-and-forth. It's better to let each state make its own decision and live with the consequences.",
            "I don't think posting things on Myspace is private. It's like a bulletin board, open for anyone to see, including school officials. If you're putting something on the internet, you have to realize that people might see it, even if they aren't looking for trouble.\n\nI get that they shouldn't be constantly snooping, but if seeing something online helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, I think it's okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and if that means looking online sometimes, I think it's justified.\n\nIt's like if they find out students are drinking or smoking through their Myspace pages. That's not cool, but I understand why they'd want to stop those things.\n\nIt's just like emails – you shouldn't write things on emails you wouldn't want anyone else to see. Everything online can come back to bite you later. Once it's out there, it's out there forever.\n\nI think it's a bit different if they're specifically trying to catch students doing something wrong, but if they stumble across something that could prevent a tragedy, then they should absolutely act on it. Parents drop their kids off at school expecting it to be a safe place, and the school has to do everything it can to make sure that's the case. Just like with lockdown drills and security measures after 9/11, they're just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, after 9/11, I was totally on board. I was so affected personally that I wanted revenge, you know?  I felt like we should go in there and make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We didn't really think things through, we just jumped in unprepared and without a plan. \n\nHonestly, I think it backfired. I don't think it achieved anything. If anything, it just made things worse. It's like, those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  It's hard for me to care about what's going on there. They can't even get along with each other, so why should we be trying to fix their problems? \n\nI know 9/11 was a huge deal, but  I just don't think we were ready for what we were walking into. It's not like war here, it's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making things better, they just want us out. Honestly, I think we should just leave. \n\nI think it was mostly anger and revenge that drove us to go to war. I think President Bush felt like he had to do something, and the people wanted action. But we should have thought it through more. We didn't have a clear plan for what we were going to do, and there wasn't any unity on what our goals were.\n\nAnd I think we're fooling ourselves if we think we can change them. They're just going to keep fighting, no matter what we do.  I think we're hurting ourselves more than we're helping them.  We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there.  It's just going to collapse again once we leave, and we can't stay there forever."

heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. They've been noticing a decline in followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of modern ideas.\n\nTake issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong, traditional views on these, which is fine, but they seem a bit outdated. If they were more open to different viewpoints, maybe they wouldn't be losing people.  \n\nI've heard that some folks are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these topics. People are looking for a church that aligns with their own beliefs, especially on things like abortion and gay marriage. If you believe in those things, you might not feel comfortable in a church that condemns them.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a job and a family life. Why shouldn't priests?",
            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage. I think people should be able to marry whoever they love, whether they were born that way or not. It's not like it's a choice someone makes.  It feels wrong to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about it too much, but I think it's unfair to deny people the right to marry just because of who they are. It's like being born straight or gay – it's just part of who you are. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this. It's a personal decision, not something that affects national security or morality. It seems like the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to tell people who they can and can't marry. It's not their place to judge people's relationships.\n\nIt's just not right to treat people differently because of their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be made to feel ashamed or like they made a wrong choice. It's who they are, and that's okay.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There isn't a strong reason against it. Some people worry that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but completely different.  \n\nThere are also lots of civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't always be by your side in the hospital or make decisions for you if you're sick because they aren't legally considered family. That seems unfair if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships are just as successful as heterosexual ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. \n\nWhat people are really arguing about is the legal definition of marriage, not religious ceremonies. Gay couples want a government-issued marriage certificate, not a church blessing.  \n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. They deserve the same rights and recognition. Some people worry about adoption and its impact on children, but studies show no difference in outcomes for children raised by same-sex couples compared to those raised by heterosexual couples.\n\nThe real issue is societal prejudice. Kids of gay parents sometimes face bullying and discrimination, which is heartbreaking. \n\nUltimately, the government should support equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's views on this issue seem heavily influenced by his religion, which is a personal belief that shouldn't dictate policy for everyone. \n\nSome people believe gayness is a psychological disorder, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth. We should trust scientific evidence and challenge harmful stereotypes.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs. Like, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful. I mean, think about it: there are tons of drugs that pharmacies use all the time, even though they're controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. Those are powerful medications, but they're used because they actually help people.  If we're saying marijuana can't be used for medical purposes just because it's illegal, that seems kinda unfair. It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nI know some people think marijuana is a gateway drug and will lead to worse things, but alcohol can be pretty harmful too if you abuse it. It's a tough issue. Maybe the best approach would be to gradually make it legal, so we don't see a huge surge in abuse right away. But first, we need to get rid of the stigma around marijuana. If people don't see it as this scary, dangerous substance, they might be more likely to use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to fit the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now that I'm older, they've started a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see families rushing in from the beach still in their swimsuits. The morning masses, which I used to always dress up for, are now full of people in jeans and khakis. Things are definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other things, like the priest abuse scandals, I don't think allowing women priests or married priests would have prevented those. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's about the individual, not their marital status. I think people choose to become priests, and if they want to be married, they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic, not something people choose. You can't hide that with marriage. It might come out eventually. The church might have covered up some cases, but I don't think they could have stopped it entirely.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were coming from at first, but everyone was still super shaken up after 9/11. I feel like the Iraq War was kind of a setup, you know? There were reasons they gave us, but looking back…  \n\nThe Bush administration kept saying that the Iraq War was connected to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, and that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, that was all a bunch of lies. And that really grinds my gears.  \n\nHonestly, it just feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just straight-up wrong. It's like, they didn't care about the Constitution, they just wanted to go to war.\n\nI think they came into office with the goal of going to war already set in stone. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book saying that? He was probably pushed out of his job, but it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he wanted to control more of the oil supply, too. Pretty shady, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause a huge mess, though. There's a good chance Iraq would fall into civil war and even more people would die. \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries in the area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to help restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could cause even more problems down the road because Iraq's independence would be a huge issue. \n\nThe news says the Parliament isn't really working, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have a lot of power. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party has a bunch of seats in Parliament now! There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's all pretty chaotic.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't officially declared a war, you know? It felt more like a \"get back\" at Iraq because they were blamed for 9/11. Honestly, I'm not really up-to-date on all the details. I guess the idea is to build a democracy there, like another America, and maybe get some oil while we're at it. But it's just causing a lot of anger and resentment, and staying there isn't really solving anything.\n\nIt's a tough situation. If we leave, they'll be upset because they feel like we abandoned them after messing things up. But if we stay, it'll take forever to build a stable democracy, and it might not even work.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing is really complicated. I feel bad for the families with loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. But I also think it's costing us a lot of resources and making us look bad on the world stage. It's like the Vietnam War; it was an undeclared war that ended up being called meaningless.  I worry that this will be remembered as another one of those.",
            "I strongly believe it's wrong for the government to make laws about this issue. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices would go against that principle. \n\nIt feels like those pushing to make it illegal are simply favoring one church's beliefs over others.  Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution, allowing for religious freedom in the United States. Even discussing a potential amendment on this topic feels wrong, because it contradicts what's already established.  It would be one of the few amendments aimed at restricting people rather than the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The person pushing for this amendment seems to be motivated by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it appears he's favoring one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide these matters, not the president or any government official. There's no real justification for this amendment besides personal views.\n\nI don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or society. It might even have a positive effect.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11, and that's how the invasion started in 2003.  \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes.  \n\nThis war feels a lot like Vietnam in many ways, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. \n\nThe US was trying to put in a new democratic government, kind of like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to push back against communism.  But the government should have known it wouldn't be a quick, clear victory. It was more of a loss in Vietnam, and it's playing out the same way here.  \n\nNo matter how many people might support the US, there will always be insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nSo, I think the government should have never gotten involved in the first place. But if they had to, they needed to be fully prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there at the end of 2006, with American troops still dying, and they're struggling to train Iraqi forces. \n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a simple mission, but building a new government takes a lot of time and effort.  Look at our own history – democracy took a long fight to establish.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough situation. It's hard to walk away after we've been there so long. We took their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a democratic Iraq?\n\nIt makes you wonder why it's just Iraq. Why aren't we doing the same for other countries? It feels like it's all about the oil, and the control it gives us.  Remember the whole \"weapons of mass destruction\" thing? We never found them, yet we haven't done anything about North Korea, which we know has them. \n\nIt makes you question if the government is being truthful in their decisions. All I can hope for is a peaceful resolution soon.",
            "Let me tell you, I’m all for gay marriage. Always have been.  I truly believe it’s a personal choice, something that science is increasingly showing has a biological basis rather than being purely a social construct.  It just seems wrong to limit someone’s rights based on something they can’t control. It feels inhumane, you know? I’ve been a strong supporter of gay marriage for a long time.\n\nTo me, politics and government shouldn’t have a say in this at all. It’s about personal relationships, about families.  Right here in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren’t married because they can’t be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, being neighbors.  But it’s frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to dictate what marriage means, playing God with the very definition of it.  It’s ridiculous, if you ask me.\n\nI’ve read and heard from a lot of sources – news articles, TV reports, you name it – that being gay might have a biological component. It could be something you’re predisposed to, like a chemical makeup in your brain, rather than something you choose based on your upbringing or environment. That’s the biological side, as opposed to the sociological side.\n\nBeyond the ethical implications, there’s this whole public vs. private thing.  A straight couple can get married quietly, no fuss. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news. It shouldn't be this public spectacle. It should be a personal, private matter, not something the government gets to control.",
            "When you share something online, it's essentially in a public space.  Think of it like a town square where everyone can see and read what you post. As a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand how what people put online can impact others' perceptions of them. If you're talking about harmful things like violence or explosions, someone's likely to take notice and react.  \n\nThe internet reaches a vast audience – if you're friends with someone on MySpace, they'll see your bulletin.  Someone might bring something they saw online to the attention of the school, and they have a responsibility to investigate. They can't ignore a potential threat, even if it seems like a joke.\n\nOf course, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes people just goof around.  Maybe it was a harmless experiment for a sociology class that went awry. But sometimes, what seems like a joke can become serious, especially in light of a recent incident. \n\nThink of it this way: if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it online. You can't control how people interpret your words, but you can control what you share. It's a matter of personal responsibility.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friend-requesting their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a duty to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone has shared it publicly.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. I don't believe teachers should create fake social media accounts to befriend their students, as that crosses a line.  Personally, I wouldn't want to know what my residents are doing on their social media accounts, as it's not my place to monitor their personal lives.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long.  Initially, I thought the goal was noble – to bring democracy to a country that lacked fair political systems. However, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power on the world stage.  There were also questions about the motives from the beginning, especially regarding any past issues between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the goal truly was to establish democracy in a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But I think our reasons have become muddled over time. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a clear victory to justify our continued involvement.\n\nThe war lasted for months and years beyond what was initially needed to make a statement. At some point, the Iraqi government and its people need to take responsibility for their own future. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict while neglecting our own pressing issues here at home, like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare.  \n\nSpending so much on a war that has lost its purpose is draining our economy. We should be investing in our own citizens and addressing the problems within our own borders.  It's simply not right to continue sacrificing our own people for a war that no longer serves a clear purpose.",
            "So, I'm thinking about this thing where someone found information on Myspace and was able to stop something bad from happening.  I get that it's a good thing, you know, saving a life and all. But it makes me wonder, is it okay to look through people's profiles like that? Like, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right? So if you're friends with someone, isn't that kind of giving them permission to see your stuff? I mean, once you put something online, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  \n\nIt's a tough situation. You can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, but it also seems wrong to just randomly look at people's stuff.  It feels like discrimination if they're only looking at certain people's profiles, like the \"bad kids.\"\n\nI'm a little creeped out by the idea that people can find out so much about me online. I know there are weird people out there who look through profiles and stuff. I saw this thing on TV where this guy figured out a girl's screen name and started IMing her in less than a minute. It made me think, how much do we really know about the people we're \"friends\" with online?\n\nI try to be careful about what I put on Facebook, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\n\nI also heard that some high schools banned Myspace. That seems weird to me. Like, how can they tell kids they can't have Myspace? Isn't that kind of invading their privacy?",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else was already against it from the start. But honestly, it doesn't really matter now. It's pretty clear that the war was a bad idea, except maybe to the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls –  Americans, Iraqis, even people all around the world think it was a mistake.  A lot of the U.S. troops over there agree, too. They think we should pull out within a year.\n\nLooking back, the whole thing has been a disaster. It was already a mess before we got involved, and pulling out is going to be tough too.  The Middle East is a complicated place, and there's a huge gap between American culture and the culture there. It seems like the U.S. government just wants to force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about the consequences is never the answer. It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The government might have some ideas, but I haven't heard anything that makes sense. If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but it just feels like we should leave now.  \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a lot of them want us to leave immediately. Those are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least they made the decision. If things go bad, we can say we were going to stay, but they asked us to leave.  Maybe that makes us the good guys in the end, even if we're never truly good guys in the Middle East.  At least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the US. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in.  Women face a \"glass ceiling\" where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, a lot of people still struggle with the idea of having a woman as their boss. This is because society has always been this way, and it takes time to change. So, a woman might be perfectly qualified for a job, but the people making the hiring decisions might not choose her because they picture someone else in that position – someone who's male. \n\nThe same goes for men in some fields, like being a stay-at-home parent. It's not common to see dads staying home, and people often look down on it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they might question why a man isn't working if he's at home. This can be tough for those dads who truly want to raise their kids and whose wives might be the ones earning the income. \n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Men who are interested in fashion can sometimes be dismissed because people assume they don't really understand women's fashion. It's like they have to prove themselves more because their interests don't fit the stereotype.\n\nOverall, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in the US, and it varies depending on what field you're in. Change is happening, though. More women are reaching high positions, and more men are embracing their roles as stay-at-home dads. But it's a slow process. It's important to keep pushing for equality, but also to do it in a way that doesn't feel forced. We need to highlight the qualities of those who are often stereotyped and let people see that they deserve respect and recognition for their talents and skills",
            "So basically, instead of making marijuana illegal, they decided to decriminalize it. This means it's not a crime anymore, more like a traffic ticket.  You get a citation instead of being arrested, booked, and hauled into court.  \n\nThere are still some worries about the downsides, though. Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews could still be affected by a marijuana citation. It's a big deal for a lot of people, especially young folks.\n\nBut on the other hand, getting people arrested and processed for marijuana is really expensive for everyone.  Think about it: police time, court costs, lawyers, jail time... it all adds up.  \n\nSome cities are strapped for cash and see decriminalization as a way to save money. They could use that money for things like schools, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, seem to be doing alright with decriminalization. They're probably using the money saved to help their community.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about what would happen if marijuana were fully legalized.  Would it be sold everywhere, like cigarettes?  Would people be smoking it while driving? It's still considered a bit taboo in a lot of places, so that could be awkward.\n\nIt's tricky to compare marijuana and alcohol. Alcohol might be worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with a person's life in other ways. \n\nIt all depends on the person. Some people can handle any substance in moderation, while others struggle. There's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to drugs.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do seems really traditional. They've been doing things the same way for ages, and it's good to have strong roots in tradition.  But it's also important to be able to change with the times. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Honestly, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't seem very welcoming to people who aren't exactly \"perfect Catholics,\" and they don't really accept people of other religions either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very tolerant to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic value, but it seems hypocritical to say you love people and then not accept them.\n\nSo, it feels like a lot of Catholic teaching tells you to do one thing, but the actual practice goes against it because it's so old-fashioned. They just keep doing things the same way.\n\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily solve everything. I personally think it would be good, but I don't think it would stop pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue.\n\nThe people who abuse children would probably do it regardless of whether they were married or not because they're targeting children, which is different from a spouse. \n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent these things from happening; they would probably still happen.",
            "I'm still figuring things out on this whole marriage equality debate. It's tough because it touches on such sensitive issues like separating church and state and figuring out what marriage really means.  I don't think it's easy to address this topic without upsetting people.  It feels like a real balancing act.  \n\nPersonally, I think civil unions are a good starting point. Maybe we shouldn't let the government define what constitutes a \"marriage\" since it's often seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't treat baptisms or other religious ceremonies in a specific way. If you're in a civil union, it's simply two people who have committed to each other. The government shouldn't get involved in the \"what kind of marriage\" conversation, just recognize the union.\n\nI think if all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment feels wrong.  It's just too big of a deal to change the Constitution over something like this. There are important issues that deserve that kind of attention.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. I have many gay friends, and while I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each state individually, not the president.\n\nThink about it: some states lean Democratic, others Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're kind of accepting their stance. \n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, I think legalization should be left to the states.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It shouldn't be up to him to decide for the whole country, especially since he doesn't live in every state. States should have the autonomy to decide what's best for their residents. Plus, with Bush leaving office soon, a Democratic president could overturn the ban, creating constant back-and-forth. It's better to let each state make its own decision and live with the consequences.",
            "I don't think posting things on Myspace is private. It's like a bulletin board, open for anyone to see, including school officials. If you're putting something on the internet, you have to realize that people might see it, even if they aren't looking for trouble.\n\nI get that they shouldn't be constantly snooping, but if seeing something online helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, I think it's okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and if that means looking online sometimes, I think it's justified.\n\nIt's like if they find out students are drinking or smoking through their Myspace pages. That's not cool, but I understand why they'd want to stop those things.\n\nIt's just like emails – you shouldn't write things on emails you wouldn't want anyone else to see. Everything online can come back to bite you later. Once it's out there, it's out there forever.\n\nI think it's a bit different if they're specifically trying to catch students doing something wrong, but if they stumble across something that could prevent a tragedy, then they should absolutely act on it. Parents drop their kids off at school expecting it to be a safe place, and the school has to do everything it can to make sure that's the case. Just like with lockdown drills and security measures after 9/11, they're just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, after 9/11, I was totally on board. I was so affected personally that I wanted revenge, you know?  I felt like we should go in there and make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We didn't really think things through, we just jumped in unprepared and without a plan. \n\nHonestly, I think it backfired. I don't think it achieved anything. If anything, it just made things worse. It's like, those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  It's hard for me to care about what's going on there. They can't even get along with each other, so why should we be trying to fix their problems? \n\nI know 9/11 was a huge deal, but  I just don't think we were ready for what we were walking into. It's not like war here, it's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making things better, they just want us out. Honestly, I think we should just leave. \n\nI think it was mostly anger and revenge that drove us to go to war. I think President Bush felt like he had to do something, and the people wanted action. But we should have thought it through more. We didn't have a clear plan for what we were going to do, and there wasn't any unity on what our goals were.\n\nAnd I think we're fooling ourselves if we think we can change them. They're just going to keep fighting, no matter what we do.  I think we're hurting ourselves more than we're helping them.  We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there.  It's just going to collapse again once we leave, and we can't stay there forever."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. They've been noticing a decline in followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of modern ideas.\n\nTake issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong, traditional views on these, which is fine, but they seem a bit outdated. If they were more open to different viewpoints, maybe they wouldn't be losing people.  \n\nI've heard that some folks are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these topics. People are looking for a church that aligns with their own beliefs, especially on things like abortion and gay marriage. If you believe in those things, you might not feel comfortable in a church that condemns them.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a job and a family life. Why shouldn't priests?",
            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage. I think people should be able to marry whoever they love, whether they were born that way or not. It's not like it's a choice someone makes.  It feels wrong to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about it too much, but I think it's unfair to deny people the right to marry just because of who they are. It's like being born straight or gay – it's just part of who you are. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this. It's a personal decision, not something that affects national security or morality. It seems like the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to tell people who they can and can't marry. It's not their place to judge people's relationships.\n\nIt's just not right to treat people differently because of their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be made to feel ashamed or like they made a wrong choice. It's who they are, and that's okay.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There isn't a strong reason against it. Some people worry that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but completely different.  \n\nThere are also lots of civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't always be by your side in the hospital or make decisions for you if you're sick because they aren't legally considered family. That seems unfair if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships are just as successful as heterosexual ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. \n\nWhat people are really arguing about is the legal definition of marriage, not religious ceremonies. Gay couples want a government-issued marriage certificate, not a church blessing.  \n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. They deserve the same rights and recognition. Some people worry about adoption and its impact on children, but studies show no difference in outcomes for children raised by same-sex couples compared to those raised by heterosexual couples.\n\nThe real issue is societal prejudice. Kids of gay parents sometimes face bullying and discrimination, which is heartbreaking. \n\nUltimately, the government should support equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's views on this issue seem heavily influenced by his religion, which is a personal belief that shouldn't dictate policy for everyone. \n\nSome people believe gayness is a psychological disorder, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth. We should trust scientific evidence and challenge harmful stereotypes.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs. Like, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful. I mean, think about it: there are tons of drugs that pharmacies use all the time, even though they're controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. Those are powerful medications, but they're used because they actually help people.  If we're saying marijuana can't be used for medical purposes just because it's illegal, that seems kinda unfair. It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nI know some people think marijuana is a gateway drug and will lead to worse things, but alcohol can be pretty harmful too if you abuse it. It's a tough issue. Maybe the best approach would be to gradually make it legal, so we don't see a huge surge in abuse right away. But first, we need to get rid of the stigma around marijuana. If people don't see it as this scary, dangerous substance, they might be more likely to use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to fit the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now that I'm older, they've started a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see families rushing in from the beach still in their swimsuits. The morning masses, which I used to always dress up for, are now full of people in jeans and khakis. Things are definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other things, like the priest abuse scandals, I don't think allowing women priests or married priests would have prevented those. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's about the individual, not their marital status. I think people choose to become priests, and if they want to be married, they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic, not something people choose. You can't hide that with marriage. It might come out eventually. The church might have covered up some cases, but I don't think they could have stopped it entirely.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were coming from at first, but everyone was still super shaken up after 9/11. I feel like the Iraq War was kind of a setup, you know? There were reasons they gave us, but looking back…  \n\nThe Bush administration kept saying that the Iraq War was connected to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, and that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, that was all a bunch of lies. And that really grinds my gears.  \n\nHonestly, it just feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just straight-up wrong. It's like, they didn't care about the Constitution, they just wanted to go to war.\n\nI think they came into office with the goal of going to war already set in stone. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book saying that? He was probably pushed out of his job, but it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he wanted to control more of the oil supply, too. Pretty shady, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause a huge mess, though. There's a good chance Iraq would fall into civil war and even more people would die. \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries in the area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to help restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could cause even more problems down the road because Iraq's independence would be a huge issue. \n\nThe news says the Parliament isn't really working, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have a lot of power. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party has a bunch of seats in Parliament now! There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's all pretty chaotic.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't officially declared a war, you know? It felt more like a \"get back\" at Iraq because they were blamed for 9/11. Honestly, I'm not really up-to-date on all the details. I guess the idea is to build a democracy there, like another America, and maybe get some oil while we're at it. But it's just causing a lot of anger and resentment, and staying there isn't really solving anything.\n\nIt's a tough situation. If we leave, they'll be upset because they feel like we abandoned them after messing things up. But if we stay, it'll take forever to build a stable democracy, and it might not even work.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing is really complicated. I feel bad for the families with loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. But I also think it's costing us a lot of resources and making us look bad on the world stage. It's like the Vietnam War; it was an undeclared war that ended up being called meaningless.  I worry that this will be remembered as another one of those.",
            "I strongly believe it's wrong for the government to make laws about this issue. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices would go against that principle. \n\nIt feels like those pushing to make it illegal are simply favoring one church's beliefs over others.  Most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except in certain areas like Boston. I don't think the government should decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution, allowing for religious freedom in the United States. Even discussing a potential amendment on this topic feels wrong, because it contradicts what's already established.  It would be one of the few amendments aimed at restricting people rather than the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The person pushing for this amendment seems to be motivated by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it appears he's favoring one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide these matters, not the president or any government official. There's no real justification for this amendment besides personal views.\n\nI don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or society. It might even have a positive effect.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11, and that's how the invasion started in 2003.  \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes.  \n\nThis war feels a lot like Vietnam in many ways, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. \n\nThe US was trying to put in a new democratic government, kind of like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to push back against communism.  But the government should have known it wouldn't be a quick, clear victory. It was more of a loss in Vietnam, and it's playing out the same way here.  \n\nNo matter how many people might support the US, there will always be insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nSo, I think the government should have never gotten involved in the first place. But if they had to, they needed to be fully prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there at the end of 2006, with American troops still dying, and they're struggling to train Iraqi forces. \n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a simple mission, but building a new government takes a lot of time and effort.  Look at our own history – democracy took a long fight to establish.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough situation. It's hard to walk away after we've been there so long. We took their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a democratic Iraq?\n\nIt makes you wonder why it's just Iraq. Why aren't we doing the same for other countries? It feels like it's all about the oil, and the control it gives us.  Remember the whole \"weapons of mass destruction\" thing? We never found them, yet we haven't done anything about North Korea, which we know has them. \n\nIt makes you question if the government is being truthful in their decisions. All I can hope for is a peaceful resolution soon.",
            "Let me tell you, I’m all for gay marriage. Always have been.  I truly believe it’s a personal choice, something that science is increasingly showing has a biological basis rather than being purely a social construct.  It just seems wrong to limit someone’s rights based on something they can’t control. It feels inhumane, you know? I’ve been a strong supporter of gay marriage for a long time.\n\nTo me, politics and government shouldn’t have a say in this at all. It’s about personal relationships, about families.  Right here in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren’t married because they can’t be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, being neighbors.  But it’s frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to dictate what marriage means, playing God with the very definition of it.  It’s ridiculous, if you ask me.\n\nI’ve read and heard from a lot of sources – news articles, TV reports, you name it – that being gay might have a biological component. It could be something you’re predisposed to, like a chemical makeup in your brain, rather than something you choose based on your upbringing or environment. That’s the biological side, as opposed to the sociological side.\n\nBeyond the ethical implications, there’s this whole public vs. private thing.  A straight couple can get married quietly, no fuss. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news. It shouldn't be this public spectacle. It should be a personal, private matter, not something the government gets to control.",
            "When you share something online, it's essentially in a public space.  Think of it like a town square where everyone can see and read what you post. As a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand how what people put online can impact others' perceptions of them. If you're talking about harmful things like violence or explosions, someone's likely to take notice and react.  \n\nThe internet reaches a vast audience – if you're friends with someone on MySpace, they'll see your bulletin.  Someone might bring something they saw online to the attention of the school, and they have a responsibility to investigate. They can't ignore a potential threat, even if it seems like a joke.\n\nOf course, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes people just goof around.  Maybe it was a harmless experiment for a sociology class that went awry. But sometimes, what seems like a joke can become serious, especially in light of a recent incident. \n\nThink of it this way: if you don't want something to be seen, don't post it online. You can't control how people interpret your words, but you can control what you share. It's a matter of personal responsibility.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friend-requesting their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a duty to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone has shared it publicly.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. I don't believe teachers should create fake social media accounts to befriend their students, as that crosses a line.  Personally, I wouldn't want to know what my residents are doing on their social media accounts, as it's not my place to monitor their personal lives.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long.  Initially, I thought the goal was noble – to bring democracy to a country that lacked fair political systems. However, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power on the world stage.  There were also questions about the motives from the beginning, especially regarding any past issues between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the goal truly was to establish democracy in a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But I think our reasons have become muddled over time. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a clear victory to justify our continued involvement.\n\nThe war lasted for months and years beyond what was initially needed to make a statement. At some point, the Iraqi government and its people need to take responsibility for their own future. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict while neglecting our own pressing issues here at home, like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare.  \n\nSpending so much on a war that has lost its purpose is draining our economy. We should be investing in our own citizens and addressing the problems within our own borders.  It's simply not right to continue sacrificing our own people for a war that no longer serves a clear purpose.",
            "So, I'm thinking about this thing where someone found information on Myspace and was able to stop something bad from happening.  I get that it's a good thing, you know, saving a life and all. But it makes me wonder, is it okay to look through people's profiles like that? Like, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right? So if you're friends with someone, isn't that kind of giving them permission to see your stuff? I mean, once you put something online, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  \n\nIt's a tough situation. You can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, but it also seems wrong to just randomly look at people's stuff.  It feels like discrimination if they're only looking at certain people's profiles, like the \"bad kids.\"\n\nI'm a little creeped out by the idea that people can find out so much about me online. I know there are weird people out there who look through profiles and stuff. I saw this thing on TV where this guy figured out a girl's screen name and started IMing her in less than a minute. It made me think, how much do we really know about the people we're \"friends\" with online?\n\nI try to be careful about what I put on Facebook, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\n\nI also heard that some high schools banned Myspace. That seems weird to me. Like, how can they tell kids they can't have Myspace? Isn't that kind of invading their privacy?",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else was already against it from the start. But honestly, it doesn't really matter now. It's pretty clear that the war was a bad idea, except maybe to the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls –  Americans, Iraqis, even people all around the world think it was a mistake.  A lot of the U.S. troops over there agree, too. They think we should pull out within a year.\n\nLooking back, the whole thing has been a disaster. It was already a mess before we got involved, and pulling out is going to be tough too.  The Middle East is a complicated place, and there's a huge gap between American culture and the culture there. It seems like the U.S. government just wants to force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about the consequences is never the answer. It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The government might have some ideas, but I haven't heard anything that makes sense. If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but it just feels like we should leave now.  \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a lot of them want us to leave immediately. Those are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know what's best. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least they made the decision. If things go bad, we can say we were going to stay, but they asked us to leave.  Maybe that makes us the good guys in the end, even if we're never truly good guys in the Middle East.  At least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the US. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in.  Women face a \"glass ceiling\" where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, a lot of people still struggle with the idea of having a woman as their boss. This is because society has always been this way, and it takes time to change. So, a woman might be perfectly qualified for a job, but the people making the hiring decisions might not choose her because they picture someone else in that position – someone who's male. \n\nThe same goes for men in some fields, like being a stay-at-home parent. It's not common to see dads staying home, and people often look down on it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they might question why a man isn't working if he's at home. This can be tough for those dads who truly want to raise their kids and whose wives might be the ones earning the income. \n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Men who are interested in fashion can sometimes be dismissed because people assume they don't really understand women's fashion. It's like they have to prove themselves more because their interests don't fit the stereotype.\n\nOverall, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in the US, and it varies depending on what field you're in. Change is happening, though. More women are reaching high positions, and more men are embracing their roles as stay-at-home dads. But it's a slow process. It's important to keep pushing for equality, but also to do it in a way that doesn't feel forced. We need to highlight the qualities of those who are often stereotyped and let people see that they deserve respect and recognition for their talents and skills",
            "So basically, instead of making marijuana illegal, they decided to decriminalize it. This means it's not a crime anymore, more like a traffic ticket.  You get a citation instead of being arrested, booked, and hauled into court.  \n\nThere are still some worries about the downsides, though. Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews could still be affected by a marijuana citation. It's a big deal for a lot of people, especially young folks.\n\nBut on the other hand, getting people arrested and processed for marijuana is really expensive for everyone.  Think about it: police time, court costs, lawyers, jail time... it all adds up.  \n\nSome cities are strapped for cash and see decriminalization as a way to save money. They could use that money for things like schools, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, seem to be doing alright with decriminalization. They're probably using the money saved to help their community.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about what would happen if marijuana were fully legalized.  Would it be sold everywhere, like cigarettes?  Would people be smoking it while driving? It's still considered a bit taboo in a lot of places, so that could be awkward.\n\nIt's tricky to compare marijuana and alcohol. Alcohol might be worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with a person's life in other ways. \n\nIt all depends on the person. Some people can handle any substance in moderation, while others struggle. There's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to drugs.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do seems really traditional. They've been doing things the same way for ages, and it's good to have strong roots in tradition.  But it's also important to be able to change with the times. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Honestly, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't seem very welcoming to people who aren't exactly \"perfect Catholics,\" and they don't really accept people of other religions either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very tolerant to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic value, but it seems hypocritical to say you love people and then not accept them.\n\nSo, it feels like a lot of Catholic teaching tells you to do one thing, but the actual practice goes against it because it's so old-fashioned. They just keep doing things the same way.\n\nAllowing priests to marry wouldn't necessarily solve everything. I personally think it would be good, but I don't think it would stop pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue.\n\nThe people who abuse children would probably do it regardless of whether they were married or not because they're targeting children, which is different from a spouse. \n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent these things from happening; they would probably still happen.",
            "I'm still figuring things out on this whole marriage equality debate. It's tough because it touches on such sensitive issues like separating church and state and figuring out what marriage really means.  I don't think it's easy to address this topic without upsetting people.  It feels like a real balancing act.  \n\nPersonally, I think civil unions are a good starting point. Maybe we shouldn't let the government define what constitutes a \"marriage\" since it's often seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't treat baptisms or other religious ceremonies in a specific way. If you're in a civil union, it's simply two people who have committed to each other. The government shouldn't get involved in the \"what kind of marriage\" conversation, just recognize the union.\n\nI think if all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment feels wrong.  It's just too big of a deal to change the Constitution over something like this. There are important issues that deserve that kind of attention.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. I have many gay friends, and while I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each state individually, not the president.\n\nThink about it: some states lean Democratic, others Republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're kind of accepting their stance. \n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, I think legalization should be left to the states.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It shouldn't be up to him to decide for the whole country, especially since he doesn't live in every state. States should have the autonomy to decide what's best for their residents. Plus, with Bush leaving office soon, a Democratic president could overturn the ban, creating constant back-and-forth. It's better to let each state make its own decision and live with the consequences.",
            "I don't think posting things on Myspace is private. It's like a bulletin board, open for anyone to see, including school officials. If you're putting something on the internet, you have to realize that people might see it, even if they aren't looking for trouble.\n\nI get that they shouldn't be constantly snooping, but if seeing something online helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, I think it's okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and if that means looking online sometimes, I think it's justified.\n\nIt's like if they find out students are drinking or smoking through their Myspace pages. That's not cool, but I understand why they'd want to stop those things.\n\nIt's just like emails – you shouldn't write things on emails you wouldn't want anyone else to see. Everything online can come back to bite you later. Once it's out there, it's out there forever.\n\nI think it's a bit different if they're specifically trying to catch students doing something wrong, but if they stumble across something that could prevent a tragedy, then they should absolutely act on it. Parents drop their kids off at school expecting it to be a safe place, and the school has to do everything it can to make sure that's the case. Just like with lockdown drills and security measures after 9/11, they're just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, after 9/11, I was totally on board. I was so affected personally that I wanted revenge, you know?  I felt like we should go in there and make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We didn't really think things through, we just jumped in unprepared and without a plan. \n\nHonestly, I think it backfired. I don't think it achieved anything. If anything, it just made things worse. It's like, those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  It's hard for me to care about what's going on there. They can't even get along with each other, so why should we be trying to fix their problems? \n\nI know 9/11 was a huge deal, but  I just don't think we were ready for what we were walking into. It's not like war here, it's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making things better, they just want us out. Honestly, I think we should just leave. \n\nI think it was mostly anger and revenge that drove us to go to war. I think President Bush felt like he had to do something, and the people wanted action. But we should have thought it through more. We didn't have a clear plan for what we were going to do, and there wasn't any unity on what our goals were.\n\nAnd I think we're fooling ourselves if we think we can change them. They're just going to keep fighting, no matter what we do.  I think we're hurting ourselves more than we're helping them.  We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there.  It's just going to collapse again once we leave, and we can't stay there forever."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes, especially in how they view certain issues.  I've heard that the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these topics, and while that's understandable, their stances feel a bit outdated.\n\nIf they were more open to modern ways of thinking, I think they wouldn't have to worry as much about losing people.  Many people are starting to disagree with the Church's views on these subjects, particularly when it comes to things like abortion and gay marriage.  Someone who believes in those things might not feel comfortable in a community that condemns them. For example, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel welcome in a Church that considers it completely wrong. Same goes for those who support gay marriage.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  I'm not sure if those changes would have prevented past scandals, but it seems like a reasonable idea.\n\nThe Church says priests are \"married\" to God and devote their lives to Him, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I believe people shouldn't be judged for who they love, whether they're born that way or not. It's not a choice anyone makes. So, I think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. Honestly, I haven't given this topic a lot of thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.   \n\nI think being gay is just part of who a person is, like being straight. People aren't choosing to be gay, it's how they're born. It's not right to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI also don't think the federal government should be involved. It's not a legal or moral issue, in my opinion. I don't think it's appropriate for the government to dictate who can and can't marry. It's a personal matter.\n\nIt just seems wrong to me to treat gay people differently or make them feel like they've made a wrong choice.  They should be treated equally and allowed to live their lives how they choose.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's not a solid reason against it.  Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's totally different.  Think of it like two sides of the same coin, heads and tails are different, but they're still connected.  Gay relationships are similar to straight ones, with the same hopes, dreams, and challenges.   \n\nThere are also important rights at stake.  For example, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital, because they aren't legally recognized as family. That seems unfair if you're committed to spending your life with someone.  \n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work: love, communication, and support.  It's about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nThe core issue is that people often get hung up on the idea of a religious ceremony. Gay couples aren't demanding a church wedding, they're asking for a legal document from the government: a marriage certificate.  If we separate church and state, then this shouldn't be a problem. It's like saying you can't have a civil union because it goes against your religion, but then you're okay with a marriage license. It's \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nI hear worries about adoption and community impact, especially about how kids raised by gay parents will be treated.  But ultimately, loving parents raise happy, well-adjusted kids, regardless of their sexual orientation. It's about good parenting, not about who the parents are.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about basic equality. President Bush has strong beliefs about this issue, which seem connected to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Many arguments against gay marriage are based on religion, but morality is subjective and changes over time. Forcing one group's beliefs on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when we have a pledge of allegiance that includes \"under God\" yet oppose religious influence in government.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or caused by childhood trauma, but the American Psychological Association has debunked that myth.  It's important to rely on science and research, not just personal opinions or cultural norms. If we all listened to experts and challenged our biases, the world would be a better place.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Take marijuana, for example.  It's illegal, but I think people should be able to use it for medical reasons. I'm not saying everyone should be smoking weed, but if it can help someone, why not?  It's not like those strong painkillers, like oxycodone, Vicodin, or Percocet, which are totally legal even though they can be addictive.  I see how those are helpful, so why not give marijuana a chance?  I think people get hung up on the stigma around marijuana, but it's not as harmful as everyone makes it out to be.  It's not like heroin or cocaine.  It wouldn't hurt to at least explore its potential benefits, especially for medical use. \n\nMaybe we should make it legal gradually, so people can learn to use it responsibly.  If we just keep demonizing it, it'll always be associated with bad things.  If we could change that image, maybe people would be more open to using it safely and for good.",
            "I think the Catholic Church has changed to fit modern times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on weekends.  Now that I'm older, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.\n\nI think that's the biggest change I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know about the church's internal politics, but that's the main thing that stands out to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have stopped it. Some married men become pedophiles too, and their attraction to young children isn't caused by their marital status. It's the person, not their relationship status.\n\nBecoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions that allow priests to marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different religion.",
            "(laughs)\nYou know, at first, I was okay with the idea of the Iraq War, but I think everyone was still shaken up from the 9/11 attacks. It felt like we went into Iraq with a bunch of justifications that didn't quite add up. The Bush administration kept tying the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We now know that was all a lie.  That really bugs me, and the whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people, and they've never admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence when he was presenting it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power. It's almost like an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that.  I think the Bush administration has completely disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who basically said that in his book after he got pushed out of his job. Seems like the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably wanted to control Iraq's oil, too.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nLook, I think the war has gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably create chaos, though, and more people would die.  There's this idea now of a coalition of countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try and restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause even more problems because it'll mess with Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe news reports say that the Iraqi Parliament isn't really working. The Prime Minister doesn't seem to have any real power, and this guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, now has at least 20 seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different radical groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of tension.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting into some pretty sensitive stuff.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't even officially declared. It feels like it was just retaliation for 9/11, like we were trying to get back at Iraq because they were thought to be responsible.  I'm not really knowledgeable about the details of the war, but it seems like we're staying there to try and build a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. state, and also to access their oil. But staying there just makes everyone angry. \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be upset because things will be in chaos. It's a really tough situation. \n\nHonestly, I'm not even sure how I feel about it. I think maybe it's better to stay and try to help, but it's also wasting our resources and making our president look bad. \n\nIt's like the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now seen as meaningless. I worry that this war will be remembered the same way.  \n\nThere are families with sons and daughters in Iraq, and I want them to come home safe, but at the same time, we've disrupted their lives and culture. We're trying to force our way of life on them, which could make things worse and fuel more hatred towards the U.S. \n\nThis whole situation is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "I really don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's plainly written, and I feel that trying to enforce any kind of control over it would be going against what's already been established in the Constitution.  So, when people try to make it illegal, I think they're favoring one church's beliefs over others. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in some areas like Boston.  But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution and what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they were considering making an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. Like I said, his push for this amendment shows that he prefers one religion over others. I truly feel that it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason to support this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  I don't think the government was totally honest with us about why we went to war. They tried to tie it to 9/11, even though those two things weren't really connected. It felt like they were trying to use our anger after the attacks to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\n Personally, I'm against war, especially starting wars preemptively.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from our mistakes there. \n\nSo many American soldiers have died. They went in and just overthrew the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for what would happen next. They didn't understand the power vacuum and the chaos that would follow. They basically tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, but it's  a long and tough process. \n\nYou can't just force democracy on a country. It takes time, and it's messy. They made it seem like it would be a quick win, but it hasn't been. We've been there for years, and American troops are still dying. We're still trying to train Iraqi police and soldiers to take control of their own country. \n\n It's a tough situation.  We've been there so long, how can we just leave now?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for this?  And honestly, it feels like this was more about oil than about democracy.  We knew Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we haven't found any. Yet we're not doing anything about other countries with WMDs, like North Korea.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq someday.",
            "Let me tell you, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I truly believe it's a personal preference, something that science is increasingly showing might even have a biological basis rather than being just a social construct. It just doesn't seem right to deny people rights based on something they can't control.  It feels downright inhumane to me.  \n\nI've always championed the cause of gay marriage. Politics and government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens within families and communities.  \n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking dogs, going about their day. They're just like everyone else.\n\nIt's frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to play God and define marriage in a way that suits his beliefs. To me, it's completely ridiculous.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that research suggests being gay might be linked to things happening in our brains, a biological predisposition rather than something learned from our environment. It's not about growing up with lots of sisters or a missing father figure. It's about who you are.\n\nThe whole situation is just strange. A couple can get married without anyone knowing if they're a man and a woman, but if it's two men or two women, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news.  It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's constantly in the public eye and debated on a national level.",
            "I'm going to have to disagree with that. When you post something online, it becomes public knowledge. You can't take it back. As a Resident Assistant, I've dealt with this firsthand.\n\nWhat you share online shapes people's opinions of you. If you post about explosions or shootings, someone will react. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet is accessible to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. \n\nObviously, the school didn't receive a direct bulletin from Myspace. Someone went to the school with the information, and they had to act. They can't ignore it, because what if something actually happens?\n\nOn the other hand, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not. Sometimes people joke around online, which can lead to misunderstandings. It could be a class project gone wrong, but it could also be something truly dangerous.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked at the student's Facebook, they found things that seemed concerning. What was meant as a joke could be taken seriously given the situation.\n\nWhen you post online, there's no real privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it or take it seriously. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI don't think they should be monitoring phone calls, texts, or instant messages unless something specific is brought to their attention.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles to befriend students. That's just as invasive. As an RA, I don't want to know what my residents are doing in their personal lives. I don't want to see their pictures of them drinking or partying on Facebook. It's not my place to know, and I don't want that kind of connection.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on way too long.  At the beginning, I thought the goal was good – to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, to prove we're a superpower. I also think the original reasons for going to war might have been questionable, considering the history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason. But I don't think that's the case anymore.  \n\nIt feels like our purpose has become muddled over time. It's like we're still at war just to be at war, desperate for a decisive victory. I believe we made our point in the first few months, but it's been years, and it just feels excessive. \n\nHonestly, at this point, their government and officials need to figure things out on their own. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while neglecting our own problems here at home – poverty, failing infrastructure, healthcare – things that desperately need funding. It's a drain on our economy, and the money could be better spent elsewhere. \n\nWe don't need to be at war forever. There comes a point where we need to step back and let other countries handle their own affairs. We have our own issues to address, and it's time to focus on them.",
            "Can I ask a question to make sure I understand?  Uh, it was stopped because someone looked online and found that there was, like, some concerning information?\n\nOkay.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. And I get that on Myspace you need someone else to be a member to see your profile. You might need to be friends with them or something. But if that's the case, you've already given that person permission to see your profile. So,\n\nanyway, anytime you put something on the internet, you should know a lot of people will see it. So, if I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHmm.\n\nUm, that's tough. Because, obviously, you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something bad. But then it becomes discriminatory if they start targeting \"bad kids\" and looking through their profiles.\n\nUm, I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it depends on the situation. Like, did they stumble across the information randomly, or were they actively looking for evidence that someone was planning something? I don't really know.\n\nSure. Um, well, I don't use Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do worry that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this guy who just wanted to show how easy it was to get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and started IM-ing her. He got her to meet him in less than a minute. And, personally, I definitely wouldn't meet with someone like that.  But I've had people in my classes I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and know it's me. It's creepy because they know your interests, what you look like, sometimes even your class schedule. They know where you are during the day and who your friends are. They see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point of having a Facebook is to communicate with friends. I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. But you never really know who can see what.\n\nHmm.\n\nUh, well, I heard my roommate talking about how her high school had a problem with students having Myspace, and they banned it. That seemed a little strange to me. I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace.  \n\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how they had the right to tell people they couldn't. That's the only other thought I have.",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War. I hate to just jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start. But, honestly, it's pretty clear now that it was a bad idea.  It seems like everyone agrees, except maybe those in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  Look at the polls – in the US, Iraq, and around the world, 75 to 80% of people think the war was a mistake.  Even a lot of the American troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nIt just feels like a complete disaster, from before we even went in to now.  Pulling out will probably be a disaster too,  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's just such a clash of cultures – the US and the Middle East are so different.  I think our government has this idea that they can just impose democracy on a place where it doesn't naturally fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country that's going to turn into a mess like this feels wrong.  It's like quicksand.  I honestly don't know what to say about it.  There doesn't seem to be any good reason to stay there any longer.  \n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful plans for why staying is better, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that, but just staying feels wrong.  \n\nIt's crazy to me that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave! Maybe they know best.  If we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then we can't really blame ourselves if things go wrong afterwards.  At least we'll be able to say we tried to do what they wanted.  We might not ever be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It seems to depend on the specific field you're in. For example, women often face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposedly a thing, men might struggle to work under a female boss because of how society's been shaped for so long. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not promote her because historically, it's not common to see women in leadership roles.  \n\nIt's similar for men, though. Think about fields like fashion or staying home as a parent. It's unusual to see a stay-at-home dad. People often judge that because society expects men to be the breadwinners.  It can be tough on them if they want to be the primary caregiver while their wife works, even if it works well for their family. \n\nIn the fashion industry, straight men sometimes face skepticism because people assume they don't \"get\" fashion since it's often associated with a particular lifestyle. It's like, \"How can you know what women want if you don't live like us?\" \n\nSo, it really depends on the industry. I think there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S., but it's changing slowly. Women are taking on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. \n\nIt's all about pushing forward gradually. If we try to force change too quickly, people will resist. We've made progress, and we just need to keep going at this pace.",
            "So, they didn't actually legalize it, they decriminalized it.  That means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited instead of arrested and hauled in.  I think if someone gets caught and cited, they still face those job interview problems and other downsides that come with a drug charge, even though it's not as serious.  A lot of people worry about those future consequences, especially kids. But at the same time, think about how much money it costs to arrest, book, and hold people, plus all the court appearances and public defenders.  It's a ton of money!  Municipalities with financial problems might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it frees up funds for things like schools, social programs, and food banks.  Some communities are just against marijuana, no matter what. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's fine. They probably have more money now to spend on important things.  It's important because we don't want marijuana to be everywhere, like cigarettes sold in gas stations.  People smoking everywhere would be a mess. Plus, it's still kind of taboo in many places, so it would be awkward to see it so readily available.  I'm not sure about the volume, but I think alcohol is worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with people's lives more.  Both have downsides, but people react differently to substances. Some people are more moderate, while others go overboard.  It's hard to generalize because everyone's different.",
            "You know, I'd say Catholicism has its good points and its bad. \n\n On one hand, they're really rooted in tradition, and that can be a good thing. Traditions give you a sense of history and belonging. But on the other hand, they can be so stuck in their ways.  It feels like they expect everyone to follow their rules perfectly, and if you don't, they kinda look down on you. \n\nLike, for example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church just because of his religion. That doesn't seem very loving or accepting to me. \n\nIt's like they preach about loving everyone, but then they don't really practice what they preach. They tell you to do certain things, but then their actions contradict those teachings. It feels outdated and hypocritical. \n\nI think allowing priests to marry could be a good change, but I don't think it would stop those who are going to hurt children from doing so. It's a separate issue altogether. Pedophilia isn't about being married or not. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed in a different way.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out this whole debate about gay marriage.  I don't think either side is completely right or wrong, but it's definitely one of the toughest issues we're facing.  It's so tangled up with the separation of church and state and how we define marriage itself, which is really hard to do without upsetting people.\n\nI think civil unions are a good idea. I'm not sure if the government should define marriage since it's seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't care how people worship or if they're baptized, right?\n\nIf you're married, it should just be treated as a civil union by the government. It's about two people coming together. Whether it's a religious ceremony or not shouldn't matter.\n\nI think if all the states can agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law.  But amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is just crazy.  The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.",
            "You know, growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do believe they should have the right to marry.  I think it's something each state should decide on its own, rather than having the president make a national law about it.\n\nIt seems like states lean either Democratic or Republican, and that naturally influences their stance on gay marriage. Democratic states tend to be more supportive, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're accepting their views. \n\nMy personal feeling is that everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities.  So, allowing states to decide on this issue feels like the fairest approach.\n\nI'm not a fan of the idea of President Bush deciding that the whole country should be against gay marriage. Each state should have the freedom to choose what's right for them. He doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't get to dictate how they run their own affairs.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon, and a Democratic president might lift the ban. It would just create a constantly changing back-and-forth.  It's best to let each state make its own decision, as they're the ones who will ultimately have to live with the consequences.",
            "I don't really agree with that idea.  Myspace is meant to be public, like a bulletin board.  If you post something there, you have to understand people will see it, whether it's the school or not.  \n\nSo, if they found something on there, I think they had a right to see it.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could have easily accessed it from home.\n\nLook, if they're using the internet to stop school shootings, to protect students - that's their job, right?  I think it's okay if it means keeping everyone safe.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids who are drinking or smoking. That feels more like an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, I don't see it as a problem.  \n\nIt's just like how we have to be careful about what we post online in general. Everything is out there forever. You never know when something you said online could come back to bite you later. It's just how the world works now.\n\nI think it's like this: if you're posting something on Myspace and don't want anyone to see it, don't post it!\n\nIt's my opinion that if it helps keep the school safe, like what happened in those drills we did after 9/11, then it's worth it. Parents want to drop their kids off at school and know they're safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war… at first, I was totally on board, especially after 9/11 hit close to home. I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did.  Looking back, though, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without really thinking things through, unprepared and without a solid plan. It feels like it backfired in a big way.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm totally against it. I don't think it's accomplished anything. It seems like those people over there are too busy fighting each other to actually hurt us. I mean, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nHonestly, 9/11 kind of numbed me to what's happening over there. I just don't care anymore. I feel like they're not even human sometimes, just constantly fighting and tearing each other apart. They can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went into the war unprepared. We didn't know what to expect, and war for them is different than it is for us. It's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay.   \n\nI think we were just hyped up and looking for revenge. President Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because the people wanted it after 9/11.  I understand where he was coming from – we couldn't just let them get away with it. But I think we could have found a better way.\n\nWe didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we were there, and there wasn't much unity. It felt like we were just going in blindly. That's probably why we haven't made much progress.  I think we went in with a lot of emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's our place to change those people. They've always been like this, and I doubt anything will ever change. I don't see the point of staying there forever.  We're not making enough progress, and it's probably just hurting us more than helping."

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes, especially in how they view certain issues.  I've heard that the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these topics, and while that's understandable, their stances feel a bit outdated.\n\nIf they were more open to modern ways of thinking, I think they wouldn't have to worry as much about losing people.  Many people are starting to disagree with the Church's views on these subjects, particularly when it comes to things like abortion and gay marriage.  Someone who believes in those things might not feel comfortable in a community that condemns them. For example, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel welcome in a Church that considers it completely wrong. Same goes for those who support gay marriage.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  I'm not sure if those changes would have prevented past scandals, but it seems like a reasonable idea.\n\nThe Church says priests are \"married\" to God and devote their lives to Him, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I believe people shouldn't be judged for who they love, whether they're born that way or not. It's not a choice anyone makes. So, I think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. Honestly, I haven't given this topic a lot of thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.   \n\nI think being gay is just part of who a person is, like being straight. People aren't choosing to be gay, it's how they're born. It's not right to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI also don't think the federal government should be involved. It's not a legal or moral issue, in my opinion. I don't think it's appropriate for the government to dictate who can and can't marry. It's a personal matter.\n\nIt just seems wrong to me to treat gay people differently or make them feel like they've made a wrong choice.  They should be treated equally and allowed to live their lives how they choose.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's not a solid reason against it.  Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's totally different.  Think of it like two sides of the same coin, heads and tails are different, but they're still connected.  Gay relationships are similar to straight ones, with the same hopes, dreams, and challenges.   \n\nThere are also important rights at stake.  For example, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital, because they aren't legally recognized as family. That seems unfair if you're committed to spending your life with someone.  \n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work: love, communication, and support.  It's about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nThe core issue is that people often get hung up on the idea of a religious ceremony. Gay couples aren't demanding a church wedding, they're asking for a legal document from the government: a marriage certificate.  If we separate church and state, then this shouldn't be a problem. It's like saying you can't have a civil union because it goes against your religion, but then you're okay with a marriage license. It's \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nI hear worries about adoption and community impact, especially about how kids raised by gay parents will be treated.  But ultimately, loving parents raise happy, well-adjusted kids, regardless of their sexual orientation. It's about good parenting, not about who the parents are.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about basic equality. President Bush has strong beliefs about this issue, which seem connected to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Many arguments against gay marriage are based on religion, but morality is subjective and changes over time. Forcing one group's beliefs on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when we have a pledge of allegiance that includes \"under God\" yet oppose religious influence in government.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or caused by childhood trauma, but the American Psychological Association has debunked that myth.  It's important to rely on science and research, not just personal opinions or cultural norms. If we all listened to experts and challenged our biases, the world would be a better place.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Take marijuana, for example.  It's illegal, but I think people should be able to use it for medical reasons. I'm not saying everyone should be smoking weed, but if it can help someone, why not?  It's not like those strong painkillers, like oxycodone, Vicodin, or Percocet, which are totally legal even though they can be addictive.  I see how those are helpful, so why not give marijuana a chance?  I think people get hung up on the stigma around marijuana, but it's not as harmful as everyone makes it out to be.  It's not like heroin or cocaine.  It wouldn't hurt to at least explore its potential benefits, especially for medical use. \n\nMaybe we should make it legal gradually, so people can learn to use it responsibly.  If we just keep demonizing it, it'll always be associated with bad things.  If we could change that image, maybe people would be more open to using it safely and for good.",
            "I think the Catholic Church has changed to fit modern times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on weekends.  Now that I'm older, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.\n\nI think that's the biggest change I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know about the church's internal politics, but that's the main thing that stands out to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have stopped it. Some married men become pedophiles too, and their attraction to young children isn't caused by their marital status. It's the person, not their relationship status.\n\nBecoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions that allow priests to marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different religion.",
            "(laughs)\nYou know, at first, I was okay with the idea of the Iraq War, but I think everyone was still shaken up from the 9/11 attacks. It felt like we went into Iraq with a bunch of justifications that didn't quite add up. The Bush administration kept tying the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We now know that was all a lie.  That really bugs me, and the whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people, and they've never admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence when he was presenting it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power. It's almost like an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that.  I think the Bush administration has completely disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who basically said that in his book after he got pushed out of his job. Seems like the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably wanted to control Iraq's oil, too.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nLook, I think the war has gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably create chaos, though, and more people would die.  There's this idea now of a coalition of countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try and restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause even more problems because it'll mess with Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe news reports say that the Iraqi Parliament isn't really working. The Prime Minister doesn't seem to have any real power, and this guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, now has at least 20 seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different radical groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of tension.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting into some pretty sensitive stuff.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't even officially declared. It feels like it was just retaliation for 9/11, like we were trying to get back at Iraq because they were thought to be responsible.  I'm not really knowledgeable about the details of the war, but it seems like we're staying there to try and build a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. state, and also to access their oil. But staying there just makes everyone angry. \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be upset because things will be in chaos. It's a really tough situation. \n\nHonestly, I'm not even sure how I feel about it. I think maybe it's better to stay and try to help, but it's also wasting our resources and making our president look bad. \n\nIt's like the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now seen as meaningless. I worry that this war will be remembered the same way.  \n\nThere are families with sons and daughters in Iraq, and I want them to come home safe, but at the same time, we've disrupted their lives and culture. We're trying to force our way of life on them, which could make things worse and fuel more hatred towards the U.S. \n\nThis whole situation is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "I really don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's plainly written, and I feel that trying to enforce any kind of control over it would be going against what's already been established in the Constitution.  So, when people try to make it illegal, I think they're favoring one church's beliefs over others. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in some areas like Boston.  But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution and what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they were considering making an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. Like I said, his push for this amendment shows that he prefers one religion over others. I truly feel that it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason to support this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  I don't think the government was totally honest with us about why we went to war. They tried to tie it to 9/11, even though those two things weren't really connected. It felt like they were trying to use our anger after the attacks to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\n Personally, I'm against war, especially starting wars preemptively.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from our mistakes there. \n\nSo many American soldiers have died. They went in and just overthrew the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for what would happen next. They didn't understand the power vacuum and the chaos that would follow. They basically tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, but it's  a long and tough process. \n\nYou can't just force democracy on a country. It takes time, and it's messy. They made it seem like it would be a quick win, but it hasn't been. We've been there for years, and American troops are still dying. We're still trying to train Iraqi police and soldiers to take control of their own country. \n\n It's a tough situation.  We've been there so long, how can we just leave now?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for this?  And honestly, it feels like this was more about oil than about democracy.  We knew Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we haven't found any. Yet we're not doing anything about other countries with WMDs, like North Korea.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq someday.",
            "Let me tell you, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I truly believe it's a personal preference, something that science is increasingly showing might even have a biological basis rather than being just a social construct. It just doesn't seem right to deny people rights based on something they can't control.  It feels downright inhumane to me.  \n\nI've always championed the cause of gay marriage. Politics and government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens within families and communities.  \n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking dogs, going about their day. They're just like everyone else.\n\nIt's frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to play God and define marriage in a way that suits his beliefs. To me, it's completely ridiculous.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that research suggests being gay might be linked to things happening in our brains, a biological predisposition rather than something learned from our environment. It's not about growing up with lots of sisters or a missing father figure. It's about who you are.\n\nThe whole situation is just strange. A couple can get married without anyone knowing if they're a man and a woman, but if it's two men or two women, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news.  It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's constantly in the public eye and debated on a national level.",
            "I'm going to have to disagree with that. When you post something online, it becomes public knowledge. You can't take it back. As a Resident Assistant, I've dealt with this firsthand.\n\nWhat you share online shapes people's opinions of you. If you post about explosions or shootings, someone will react. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet is accessible to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. \n\nObviously, the school didn't receive a direct bulletin from Myspace. Someone went to the school with the information, and they had to act. They can't ignore it, because what if something actually happens?\n\nOn the other hand, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not. Sometimes people joke around online, which can lead to misunderstandings. It could be a class project gone wrong, but it could also be something truly dangerous.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked at the student's Facebook, they found things that seemed concerning. What was meant as a joke could be taken seriously given the situation.\n\nWhen you post online, there's no real privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it or take it seriously. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI don't think they should be monitoring phone calls, texts, or instant messages unless something specific is brought to their attention.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles to befriend students. That's just as invasive. As an RA, I don't want to know what my residents are doing in their personal lives. I don't want to see their pictures of them drinking or partying on Facebook. It's not my place to know, and I don't want that kind of connection.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on way too long.  At the beginning, I thought the goal was good – to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, to prove we're a superpower. I also think the original reasons for going to war might have been questionable, considering the history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason. But I don't think that's the case anymore.  \n\nIt feels like our purpose has become muddled over time. It's like we're still at war just to be at war, desperate for a decisive victory. I believe we made our point in the first few months, but it's been years, and it just feels excessive. \n\nHonestly, at this point, their government and officials need to figure things out on their own. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while neglecting our own problems here at home – poverty, failing infrastructure, healthcare – things that desperately need funding. It's a drain on our economy, and the money could be better spent elsewhere. \n\nWe don't need to be at war forever. There comes a point where we need to step back and let other countries handle their own affairs. We have our own issues to address, and it's time to focus on them.",
            "Can I ask a question to make sure I understand?  Uh, it was stopped because someone looked online and found that there was, like, some concerning information?\n\nOkay.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. And I get that on Myspace you need someone else to be a member to see your profile. You might need to be friends with them or something. But if that's the case, you've already given that person permission to see your profile. So,\n\nanyway, anytime you put something on the internet, you should know a lot of people will see it. So, if I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHmm.\n\nUm, that's tough. Because, obviously, you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something bad. But then it becomes discriminatory if they start targeting \"bad kids\" and looking through their profiles.\n\nUm, I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it depends on the situation. Like, did they stumble across the information randomly, or were they actively looking for evidence that someone was planning something? I don't really know.\n\nSure. Um, well, I don't use Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do worry that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this guy who just wanted to show how easy it was to get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and started IM-ing her. He got her to meet him in less than a minute. And, personally, I definitely wouldn't meet with someone like that.  But I've had people in my classes I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and know it's me. It's creepy because they know your interests, what you look like, sometimes even your class schedule. They know where you are during the day and who your friends are. They see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point of having a Facebook is to communicate with friends. I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. But you never really know who can see what.\n\nHmm.\n\nUh, well, I heard my roommate talking about how her high school had a problem with students having Myspace, and they banned it. That seemed a little strange to me. I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace.  \n\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how they had the right to tell people they couldn't. That's the only other thought I have.",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War. I hate to just jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start. But, honestly, it's pretty clear now that it was a bad idea.  It seems like everyone agrees, except maybe those in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  Look at the polls – in the US, Iraq, and around the world, 75 to 80% of people think the war was a mistake.  Even a lot of the American troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nIt just feels like a complete disaster, from before we even went in to now.  Pulling out will probably be a disaster too,  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's just such a clash of cultures – the US and the Middle East are so different.  I think our government has this idea that they can just impose democracy on a place where it doesn't naturally fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country that's going to turn into a mess like this feels wrong.  It's like quicksand.  I honestly don't know what to say about it.  There doesn't seem to be any good reason to stay there any longer.  \n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful plans for why staying is better, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that, but just staying feels wrong.  \n\nIt's crazy to me that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave! Maybe they know best.  If we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then we can't really blame ourselves if things go wrong afterwards.  At least we'll be able to say we tried to do what they wanted.  We might not ever be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It seems to depend on the specific field you're in. For example, women often face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposedly a thing, men might struggle to work under a female boss because of how society's been shaped for so long. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not promote her because historically, it's not common to see women in leadership roles.  \n\nIt's similar for men, though. Think about fields like fashion or staying home as a parent. It's unusual to see a stay-at-home dad. People often judge that because society expects men to be the breadwinners.  It can be tough on them if they want to be the primary caregiver while their wife works, even if it works well for their family. \n\nIn the fashion industry, straight men sometimes face skepticism because people assume they don't \"get\" fashion since it's often associated with a particular lifestyle. It's like, \"How can you know what women want if you don't live like us?\" \n\nSo, it really depends on the industry. I think there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S., but it's changing slowly. Women are taking on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. \n\nIt's all about pushing forward gradually. If we try to force change too quickly, people will resist. We've made progress, and we just need to keep going at this pace.",
            "So, they didn't actually legalize it, they decriminalized it.  That means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited instead of arrested and hauled in.  I think if someone gets caught and cited, they still face those job interview problems and other downsides that come with a drug charge, even though it's not as serious.  A lot of people worry about those future consequences, especially kids. But at the same time, think about how much money it costs to arrest, book, and hold people, plus all the court appearances and public defenders.  It's a ton of money!  Municipalities with financial problems might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it frees up funds for things like schools, social programs, and food banks.  Some communities are just against marijuana, no matter what. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's fine. They probably have more money now to spend on important things.  It's important because we don't want marijuana to be everywhere, like cigarettes sold in gas stations.  People smoking everywhere would be a mess. Plus, it's still kind of taboo in many places, so it would be awkward to see it so readily available.  I'm not sure about the volume, but I think alcohol is worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with people's lives more.  Both have downsides, but people react differently to substances. Some people are more moderate, while others go overboard.  It's hard to generalize because everyone's different.",
            "You know, I'd say Catholicism has its good points and its bad. \n\n On one hand, they're really rooted in tradition, and that can be a good thing. Traditions give you a sense of history and belonging. But on the other hand, they can be so stuck in their ways.  It feels like they expect everyone to follow their rules perfectly, and if you don't, they kinda look down on you. \n\nLike, for example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church just because of his religion. That doesn't seem very loving or accepting to me. \n\nIt's like they preach about loving everyone, but then they don't really practice what they preach. They tell you to do certain things, but then their actions contradict those teachings. It feels outdated and hypocritical. \n\nI think allowing priests to marry could be a good change, but I don't think it would stop those who are going to hurt children from doing so. It's a separate issue altogether. Pedophilia isn't about being married or not. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed in a different way.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out this whole debate about gay marriage.  I don't think either side is completely right or wrong, but it's definitely one of the toughest issues we're facing.  It's so tangled up with the separation of church and state and how we define marriage itself, which is really hard to do without upsetting people.\n\nI think civil unions are a good idea. I'm not sure if the government should define marriage since it's seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't care how people worship or if they're baptized, right?\n\nIf you're married, it should just be treated as a civil union by the government. It's about two people coming together. Whether it's a religious ceremony or not shouldn't matter.\n\nI think if all the states can agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law.  But amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is just crazy.  The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.",
            "You know, growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do believe they should have the right to marry.  I think it's something each state should decide on its own, rather than having the president make a national law about it.\n\nIt seems like states lean either Democratic or Republican, and that naturally influences their stance on gay marriage. Democratic states tend to be more supportive, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're accepting their views. \n\nMy personal feeling is that everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities.  So, allowing states to decide on this issue feels like the fairest approach.\n\nI'm not a fan of the idea of President Bush deciding that the whole country should be against gay marriage. Each state should have the freedom to choose what's right for them. He doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't get to dictate how they run their own affairs.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon, and a Democratic president might lift the ban. It would just create a constantly changing back-and-forth.  It's best to let each state make its own decision, as they're the ones who will ultimately have to live with the consequences.",
            "I don't really agree with that idea.  Myspace is meant to be public, like a bulletin board.  If you post something there, you have to understand people will see it, whether it's the school or not.  \n\nSo, if they found something on there, I think they had a right to see it.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could have easily accessed it from home.\n\nLook, if they're using the internet to stop school shootings, to protect students - that's their job, right?  I think it's okay if it means keeping everyone safe.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids who are drinking or smoking. That feels more like an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, I don't see it as a problem.  \n\nIt's just like how we have to be careful about what we post online in general. Everything is out there forever. You never know when something you said online could come back to bite you later. It's just how the world works now.\n\nI think it's like this: if you're posting something on Myspace and don't want anyone to see it, don't post it!\n\nIt's my opinion that if it helps keep the school safe, like what happened in those drills we did after 9/11, then it's worth it. Parents want to drop their kids off at school and know they're safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war… at first, I was totally on board, especially after 9/11 hit close to home. I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did.  Looking back, though, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without really thinking things through, unprepared and without a solid plan. It feels like it backfired in a big way.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm totally against it. I don't think it's accomplished anything. It seems like those people over there are too busy fighting each other to actually hurt us. I mean, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nHonestly, 9/11 kind of numbed me to what's happening over there. I just don't care anymore. I feel like they're not even human sometimes, just constantly fighting and tearing each other apart. They can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went into the war unprepared. We didn't know what to expect, and war for them is different than it is for us. It's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay.   \n\nI think we were just hyped up and looking for revenge. President Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because the people wanted it after 9/11.  I understand where he was coming from – we couldn't just let them get away with it. But I think we could have found a better way.\n\nWe didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we were there, and there wasn't much unity. It felt like we were just going in blindly. That's probably why we haven't made much progress.  I think we went in with a lot of emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's our place to change those people. They've always been like this, and I doubt anything will ever change. I don't see the point of staying there forever.  We're not making enough progress, and it's probably just hurting us more than helping."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes, especially in how they view certain issues.  I've heard that the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these topics, and while that's understandable, their stances feel a bit outdated.\n\nIf they were more open to modern ways of thinking, I think they wouldn't have to worry as much about losing people.  Many people are starting to disagree with the Church's views on these subjects, particularly when it comes to things like abortion and gay marriage.  Someone who believes in those things might not feel comfortable in a community that condemns them. For example, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel welcome in a Church that considers it completely wrong. Same goes for those who support gay marriage.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  I'm not sure if those changes would have prevented past scandals, but it seems like a reasonable idea.\n\nThe Church says priests are \"married\" to God and devote their lives to Him, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I believe people shouldn't be judged for who they love, whether they're born that way or not. It's not a choice anyone makes. So, I think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. Honestly, I haven't given this topic a lot of thought, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.   \n\nI think being gay is just part of who a person is, like being straight. People aren't choosing to be gay, it's how they're born. It's not right to hold someone responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI also don't think the federal government should be involved. It's not a legal or moral issue, in my opinion. I don't think it's appropriate for the government to dictate who can and can't marry. It's a personal matter.\n\nIt just seems wrong to me to treat gay people differently or make them feel like they've made a wrong choice.  They should be treated equally and allowed to live their lives how they choose.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's not a solid reason against it.  Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but that's just not true. It's totally different.  Think of it like two sides of the same coin, heads and tails are different, but they're still connected.  Gay relationships are similar to straight ones, with the same hopes, dreams, and challenges.   \n\nThere are also important rights at stake.  For example, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital, because they aren't legally recognized as family. That seems unfair if you're committed to spending your life with someone.  \n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work: love, communication, and support.  It's about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nThe core issue is that people often get hung up on the idea of a religious ceremony. Gay couples aren't demanding a church wedding, they're asking for a legal document from the government: a marriage certificate.  If we separate church and state, then this shouldn't be a problem. It's like saying you can't have a civil union because it goes against your religion, but then you're okay with a marriage license. It's \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nI hear worries about adoption and community impact, especially about how kids raised by gay parents will be treated.  But ultimately, loving parents raise happy, well-adjusted kids, regardless of their sexual orientation. It's about good parenting, not about who the parents are.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about basic equality. President Bush has strong beliefs about this issue, which seem connected to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Many arguments against gay marriage are based on religion, but morality is subjective and changes over time. Forcing one group's beliefs on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when we have a pledge of allegiance that includes \"under God\" yet oppose religious influence in government.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or caused by childhood trauma, but the American Psychological Association has debunked that myth.  It's important to rely on science and research, not just personal opinions or cultural norms. If we all listened to experts and challenged our biases, the world would be a better place.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Take marijuana, for example.  It's illegal, but I think people should be able to use it for medical reasons. I'm not saying everyone should be smoking weed, but if it can help someone, why not?  It's not like those strong painkillers, like oxycodone, Vicodin, or Percocet, which are totally legal even though they can be addictive.  I see how those are helpful, so why not give marijuana a chance?  I think people get hung up on the stigma around marijuana, but it's not as harmful as everyone makes it out to be.  It's not like heroin or cocaine.  It wouldn't hurt to at least explore its potential benefits, especially for medical use. \n\nMaybe we should make it legal gradually, so people can learn to use it responsibly.  If we just keep demonizing it, it'll always be associated with bad things.  If we could change that image, maybe people would be more open to using it safely and for good.",
            "I think the Catholic Church has changed to fit modern times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I saw all my friends there on weekends.  Now that I'm older, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.\n\nI think that's the biggest change I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know about the church's internal politics, but that's the main thing that stands out to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have stopped it. Some married men become pedophiles too, and their attraction to young children isn't caused by their marital status. It's the person, not their relationship status.\n\nBecoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions that allow priests to marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different religion.",
            "(laughs)\nYou know, at first, I was okay with the idea of the Iraq War, but I think everyone was still shaken up from the 9/11 attacks. It felt like we went into Iraq with a bunch of justifications that didn't quite add up. The Bush administration kept tying the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We now know that was all a lie.  That really bugs me, and the whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people, and they've never admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence when he was presenting it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power. It's almost like an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that.  I think the Bush administration has completely disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who basically said that in his book after he got pushed out of his job. Seems like the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably wanted to control Iraq's oil, too.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nLook, I think the war has gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably create chaos, though, and more people would die.  There's this idea now of a coalition of countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to try and restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause even more problems because it'll mess with Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe news reports say that the Iraqi Parliament isn't really working. The Prime Minister doesn't seem to have any real power, and this guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, now has at least 20 seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different radical groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of tension.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting into some pretty sensitive stuff.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless because it wasn't even officially declared. It feels like it was just retaliation for 9/11, like we were trying to get back at Iraq because they were thought to be responsible.  I'm not really knowledgeable about the details of the war, but it seems like we're staying there to try and build a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. state, and also to access their oil. But staying there just makes everyone angry. \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be upset because things will be in chaos. It's a really tough situation. \n\nHonestly, I'm not even sure how I feel about it. I think maybe it's better to stay and try to help, but it's also wasting our resources and making our president look bad. \n\nIt's like the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now seen as meaningless. I worry that this war will be remembered the same way.  \n\nThere are families with sons and daughters in Iraq, and I want them to come home safe, but at the same time, we've disrupted their lives and culture. We're trying to force our way of life on them, which could make things worse and fuel more hatred towards the U.S. \n\nThis whole situation is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "I really don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's plainly written, and I feel that trying to enforce any kind of control over it would be going against what's already been established in the Constitution.  So, when people try to make it illegal, I think they're favoring one church's beliefs over others. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in some areas like Boston.  But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution and what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they were considering making an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. Like I said, his push for this amendment shows that he prefers one religion over others. I truly feel that it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason to support this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  I don't think the government was totally honest with us about why we went to war. They tried to tie it to 9/11, even though those two things weren't really connected. It felt like they were trying to use our anger after the attacks to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\n Personally, I'm against war, especially starting wars preemptively.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from our mistakes there. \n\nSo many American soldiers have died. They went in and just overthrew the Iraqi government, but they weren't prepared for what would happen next. They didn't understand the power vacuum and the chaos that would follow. They basically tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, but it's  a long and tough process. \n\nYou can't just force democracy on a country. It takes time, and it's messy. They made it seem like it would be a quick win, but it hasn't been. We've been there for years, and American troops are still dying. We're still trying to train Iraqi police and soldiers to take control of their own country. \n\n It's a tough situation.  We've been there so long, how can we just leave now?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for this?  And honestly, it feels like this was more about oil than about democracy.  We knew Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we haven't found any. Yet we're not doing anything about other countries with WMDs, like North Korea.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq someday.",
            "Let me tell you, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I truly believe it's a personal preference, something that science is increasingly showing might even have a biological basis rather than being just a social construct. It just doesn't seem right to deny people rights based on something they can't control.  It feels downright inhumane to me.  \n\nI've always championed the cause of gay marriage. Politics and government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens within families and communities.  \n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family – walking dogs, going about their day. They're just like everyone else.\n\nIt's frustrating to see someone like Bush trying to play God and define marriage in a way that suits his beliefs. To me, it's completely ridiculous.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that research suggests being gay might be linked to things happening in our brains, a biological predisposition rather than something learned from our environment. It's not about growing up with lots of sisters or a missing father figure. It's about who you are.\n\nThe whole situation is just strange. A couple can get married without anyone knowing if they're a man and a woman, but if it's two men or two women, it becomes a huge deal, splashed all over the news.  It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's constantly in the public eye and debated on a national level.",

They can't ignore it, because what if something actually happens?\n\nOn the other hand, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not. Sometimes people joke around online, which can lead to misunderstandings. It could be a class project gone wrong, but it could also be something truly dangerous.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked at the student's Facebook, they found things that seemed concerning. What was meant as a joke could be taken seriously given the situation.\n\nWhen you post online, there's no real privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it or take it seriously. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI don't think they should be monitoring phone calls, texts, or instant messages unless something specific is brought to their attention.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles to befriend students. That's just as invasive. As an RA, I don't want to know what my residents are doing in their personal lives. I don't want to see their pictures of them drinking or partying on Facebook. It's not my place to know, and I don't want that kind of connection.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on way too long.  At the beginning, I thought the goal was good – to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, to prove we're a superpower. I also think the original reasons for going to war might have been questionable, considering the history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason. But I don't think that's the case anymore.  \n\nIt feels like our purpose has become muddled over time. It's like we're still at war just to be at war, desperate for a decisive victory. I believe we made our point in the first few months, but it's been years, and it just feels excessive. \n\nHonestly, at this point, their government and officials need to figure things out on their own. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while neglecting our own problems here at home – poverty, failing infrastructure, healthcare – things that desperately need funding. It's a drain on our economy, and the money could be better spent elsewhere. \n\nWe don't need to be at war forever. There comes a point where we need to step back and let other countries handle their own affairs. We have our own issues to address, and it's time to focus on them.",
            "Can I ask a question to make sure I understand?  Uh, it was stopped because someone looked online and found that there was, like, some concerning information?\n\nOkay.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. And I get that on Myspace you need someone else to be a member to see your profile. You might need to be friends with them or something. But if that's the case, you've already given that person permission to see your profile. So,\n\nanyway, anytime you put something on the internet, you should know a lot of people will see it. So, if I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nHmm.\n\nUm, that's tough. Because, obviously, you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something bad. But then it becomes discriminatory if they start targeting \"bad kids\" and looking through their profiles.\n\nUm, I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it depends on the situation. Like, did they stumble across the information randomly, or were they actively looking for evidence that someone was planning something? I don't really know.\n\nSure. Um, well, I don't use Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do worry that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV once about this guy who just wanted to show how easy it was to get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and started IM-ing her. He got her to meet him in less than a minute. And, personally, I definitely wouldn't meet with someone like that.  But I've had people in my classes I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and know it's me. It's creepy because they know your interests, what you look like, sometimes even your class schedule. They know where you are during the day and who your friends are. They see all sorts of photos. I try to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point of having a Facebook is to communicate with friends. I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. But you never really know who can see what.\n\nHmm.\n\nUh, well, I heard my roommate talking about how her high school had a problem with students having Myspace, and they banned it. That seemed a little strange to me. I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace.  \n\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how they had the right to tell people they couldn't. That's the only other thought I have.",
            "I feel kind of hypocritical talking about the Iraq War. I hate to just jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start. But, honestly, it's pretty clear now that it was a bad idea.  It seems like everyone agrees, except maybe those in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  Look at the polls – in the US, Iraq, and around the world, 75 to 80% of people think the war was a mistake.  Even a lot of the American troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nIt just feels like a complete disaster, from before we even went in to now.  Pulling out will probably be a disaster too,  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's just such a clash of cultures – the US and the Middle East are so different.  I think our government has this idea that they can just impose democracy on a place where it doesn't naturally fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country that's going to turn into a mess like this feels wrong.  It's like quicksand.  I honestly don't know what to say about it.  There doesn't seem to be any good reason to stay there any longer.  \n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful plans for why staying is better, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that, but just staying feels wrong.  \n\nIt's crazy to me that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave! Maybe they know best.  If we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then we can't really blame ourselves if things go wrong afterwards.  At least we'll be able to say we tried to do what they wanted.  We might not ever be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It seems to depend on the specific field you're in. For example, women often face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposedly a thing, men might struggle to work under a female boss because of how society's been shaped for so long. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not promote her because historically, it's not common to see women in leadership roles.  \n\nIt's similar for men, though. Think about fields like fashion or staying home as a parent. It's unusual to see a stay-at-home dad. People often judge that because society expects men to be the breadwinners.  It can be tough on them if they want to be the primary caregiver while their wife works, even if it works well for their family. \n\nIn the fashion industry, straight men sometimes face skepticism because people assume they don't \"get\" fashion since it's often associated with a particular lifestyle. It's like, \"How can you know what women want if you don't live like us?\" \n\nSo, it really depends on the industry. I think there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S., but it's changing slowly. Women are taking on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. \n\nIt's all about pushing forward gradually. If we try to force change too quickly, people will resist. We've made progress, and we just need to keep going at this pace.",
            "So, they didn't actually legalize it, they decriminalized it.  That means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited instead of arrested and hauled in.  I think if someone gets caught and cited, they still face those job interview problems and other downsides that come with a drug charge, even though it's not as serious.  A lot of people worry about those future consequences, especially kids. But at the same time, think about how much money it costs to arrest, book, and hold people, plus all the court appearances and public defenders.  It's a ton of money!  Municipalities with financial problems might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it frees up funds for things like schools, social programs, and food banks.  Some communities are just against marijuana, no matter what. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's fine. They probably have more money now to spend on important things.  It's important because we don't want marijuana to be everywhere, like cigarettes sold in gas stations.  People smoking everywhere would be a mess. Plus, it's still kind of taboo in many places, so it would be awkward to see it so readily available.  I'm not sure about the volume, but I think alcohol is worse for your motor skills, but marijuana can mess with people's lives more.  Both have downsides, but people react differently to substances. Some people are more moderate, while others go overboard.  It's hard to generalize because everyone's different.",
            "You know, I'd say Catholicism has its good points and its bad. \n\n On one hand, they're really rooted in tradition, and that can be a good thing. Traditions give you a sense of history and belonging. But on the other hand, they can be so stuck in their ways.  It feels like they expect everyone to follow their rules perfectly, and if you don't, they kinda look down on you. \n\nLike, for example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church just because of his religion. That doesn't seem very loving or accepting to me. \n\nIt's like they preach about loving everyone, but then they don't really practice what they preach. They tell you to do certain things, but then their actions contradict those teachings. It feels outdated and hypocritical. \n\nI think allowing priests to marry could be a good change, but I don't think it would stop those who are going to hurt children from doing so. It's a separate issue altogether. Pedophilia isn't about being married or not. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed in a different way.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out this whole debate about gay marriage.  I don't think either side is completely right or wrong, but it's definitely one of the toughest issues we're facing.  It's so tangled up with the separation of church and state and how we define marriage itself, which is really hard to do without upsetting people.\n\nI think civil unions are a good idea. I'm not sure if the government should define marriage since it's seen as a religious sacrament. After all, the government doesn't care how people worship or if they're baptized, right?\n\nIf you're married, it should just be treated as a civil union by the government. It's about two people coming together. Whether it's a religious ceremony or not shouldn't matter.\n\nI think if all the states can agree on a fair solution, they should push for it to become federal law.  But amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is just crazy.  The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.",
            "You know, growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do believe they should have the right to marry.  I think it's something each state should decide on its own, rather than having the president make a national law about it.\n\nIt seems like states lean either Democratic or Republican, and that naturally influences their stance on gay marriage. Democratic states tend to be more supportive, and if you choose to live in one of those states, you're accepting their views. \n\nMy personal feeling is that everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities.  So, allowing states to decide on this issue feels like the fairest approach.\n\nI'm not a fan of the idea of President Bush deciding that the whole country should be against gay marriage. Each state should have the freedom to choose what's right for them. He doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't get to dictate how they run their own affairs.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon, and a Democratic president might lift the ban. It would just create a constantly changing back-and-forth.  It's best to let each state make its own decision, as they're the ones who will ultimately have to live with the consequences.",
            "I don't really agree with that idea.  Myspace is meant to be public, like a bulletin board.  If you post something there, you have to understand people will see it, whether it's the school or not.  \n\nSo, if they found something on there, I think they had a right to see it.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could have easily accessed it from home.\n\nLook, if they're using the internet to stop school shootings, to protect students - that's their job, right?  I think it's okay if it means keeping everyone safe.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids who are drinking or smoking. That feels more like an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, I don't see it as a problem.  \n\nIt's just like how we have to be careful about what we post online in general. Everything is out there forever. You never know when something you said online could come back to bite you later. It's just how the world works now.\n\nI think it's like this: if you're posting something on Myspace and don't want anyone to see it, don't post it!\n\nIt's my opinion that if it helps keep the school safe, like what happened in those drills we did after 9/11, then it's worth it. Parents want to drop their kids off at school and know they're safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war… at first, I was totally on board, especially after 9/11 hit close to home. I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did.  Looking back, though, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without really thinking things through, unprepared and without a solid plan. It feels like it backfired in a big way.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm totally against it. I don't think it's accomplished anything. It seems like those people over there are too busy fighting each other to actually hurt us. I mean, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nHonestly, 9/11 kind of numbed me to what's happening over there. I just don't care anymore. I feel like they're not even human sometimes, just constantly fighting and tearing each other apart. They can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went into the war unprepared. We didn't know what to expect, and war for them is different than it is for us. It's brutal and savage. They don't seem interested in making their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay.   \n\nI think we were just hyped up and looking for revenge. President Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because the people wanted it after 9/11.  I understand where he was coming from – we couldn't just let them get away with it. But I think we could have found a better way.\n\nWe didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we were there, and there wasn't much unity. It felt like we were just going in blindly. That's probably why we haven't made much progress.  I think we went in with a lot of emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's our place to change those people. They've always been like this, and I doubt anything will ever change. I don't see the point of staying there forever.  We're not making enough progress, and it's probably just hurting us more than helping."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize its views in a few ways. They've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of many things.  For example, they have strong opinions on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are fine, but those views seem a bit outdated. If they were more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't worry about losing people. I've heard that some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues. They feel the Church is wrong on certain subjects.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that teaches it's completely wrong. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to be part of a church that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  It's hard to say if those changes would have prevented the recent scandals, though. Maybe they would have, maybe not.  \n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have both a job and a family.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I think it's wrong to judge someone for who they love.  Whether someone is born that way or it develops over time, it's not a choice they make, so they shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nHonestly, I haven't really thought about it too much, but it feels wrong to me.  It's like being born straight versus being born gay – you don't choose either one.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue, and I don't know if it's even a moral issue. It just feels like the government shouldn't be telling people who they can and can't love.  \n\nIt's not like gay people are doing something wrong or making a bad choice. They are who they are, and they shouldn't be treated any differently.",
            "So, I really think gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, I don't see a good reason against it. Some folks worry that gay couples are a threat to traditional families, but that just doesn't make sense to me. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're both fruits, but totally different. \n\nPlus, there are tons of important civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick, because they're not legally recognized as family.  Seems unfair, right?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's all about love and commitment.  \n\nWhat really gets me is that people think gay couples are asking for special treatment. They're not trying to get married in a church; they just want the legal recognition and protections that come with a marriage certificate. If the government's not involved in church matters, why should religion dictate who can and can't get married?\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. \n\nAnd let's talk about adoption and kids. Some folks worry about how gay parents will raise their kids, but honestly, good parenting comes down to love and support, not sexual orientation. \n\nThe truth is, some kids of gay parents face bullying and discrimination. It's heartbreaking.  \n\nI think the federal government needs to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. We need to treat everyone equally. We can't let religious beliefs dictate the law and deny people their basic rights.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it makes me think about this whole marijuana thing. Just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. I mean, there are tons of drugs we use in pharmacies that are illegal for the general public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet, you know? Those are all controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have medical benefits.  It feels wrong to say marijuana is totally off-limits just because it has a bad reputation.\n\nI get that some people worry about marijuana being abused, just like alcohol.  But honestly, I think we need to ditch the whole \"marijuana is the devil\" image. It's not as harmful as heroin or cocaine. If we stopped seeing it as this scary, dangerous drug, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\n\nMaybe we should try legalizing it gradually, not all at once. That way, we can make sure people are using it safely.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. But now, as I've gotten older, they've created a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the beach, or families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other changes, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. That's the church I know. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but that's just my experience. \n\nAbout those accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests marry would have stopped them. There are married men who become pedophiles too, and they still have attractions to young children.  I think it's about the individual, not whether or not they're allowed to get married. Becoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions where priests can be married. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they should maybe consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. I don't think people just become that way. It's something they're born with. It might have something to do with upbringing in some cases, but I think genetics play a big role. You can't hide that with marriage. You may try, but it usually comes out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, then shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Honestly, I'm still bothered by the whole Iraq War thing. Sure, at first, I kinda understood it, everyone was on edge after 9/11, but I think we rushed into it for the wrong reasons. The Bush administration kept saying it was all about Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction, but we later found out that was a bunch of lies. That really rubs me the wrong way.  It feels like they straight-up lied to the American people, and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has since said he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then.  That's just wrong, in my opinion. It's like they don't care about the Constitution or anything. \n\nI get the feeling they wanted to go to war from the start. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book after he was basically pushed out of his job? He said the younger Bush came in wanting revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened with his dad. Plus, I think they were hoping to secure our energy supply, which is pretty shady.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably cause chaos with a civil war breaking out and even more people dying. But bringing in other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help out? That doesn't seem like a good solution either. It's going to mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and honestly, I don't think their government is working anyway. The Parliament seems useless, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any power. And don't even get me started on that extremist group, the one we were fighting not too long ago. They're now in Parliament with a bunch of seats. It's all so complicated, and I don't have all the answers.",
            "I'm not sure exactly how I feel about the war in Iraq.  It feels pointless, like it was just a way for us to get back at them for 9/11. I don't really follow the news about it, so I don't know all the details.  But my understanding is we're trying to build democracy there, kind of like making it another part of the US, and also to get access to their oil. But staying there just makes everyone upset.  \n\nBuilding a democracy takes a long time, and if we leave they'll be angry because they feel like we messed things up and abandoned them.  It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, this whole thing is really complicated. I don't know if it's right to keep sending our troops there, even though it's important to help those people. It feels like we're wasting our resources, and it's making President Bush look bad. We're starting to sound like we're just trying to show off our strength and power, like the Vietnam War.  \n\nI also think about the families of the soldiers who are in Iraq. I want them to come home safely, but I also worry about the people of Iraq and the impact of our presence on their lives and culture. \n\nWhat if we're just making things worse by trying to force our ideas on them? Maybe it's best to leave and let them find their own way, even if it's painful. This whole war seems like it's going to drag on for years and years. I just don't know what the right answer is.",
            "I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be going against what's already been written in stone. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another, because most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some areas like Boston. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they're thinking about making an amendment, I think it would be wrong and go against what's already been established. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason for an amendment banning it, other than personal views. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or anything else. It might even be positive for society.",
            "Ok, so the war in Iraq. To be honest, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about the reasons we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, but really, the two weren't that connected.  But the government played on people's emotions after 9/11,  and that's how the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. And I think this war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War. We should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's horrible. I think the government wasn't prepared for the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government. They weren't ready for the power vacuum and the unrest.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – we tried to push out Communism and install democracy, and it was a long, hard struggle. We should have known it wouldn't be a quick victory. In Vietnam, no matter how many people supported us, there were always insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people.\n\nSo, first, I think we shouldn't have gone to war at all. But if we're going to, we need to plan for everything. I don't think the government was prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. We're trying to train the Iraqi police and army, but it's a slow process.\n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, successful mission. But it takes years to build a new government.  Look at our own country – democracy took a long time to develop.  It wasn't easy.\n\n\nI think the government made it seem like it would be easy to change Iraq. \n\nIt's hard because we've been there so long. How can we just abandon them now after taking their government and way of life? But we also have to consider the cost in American lives. How many is too many?  \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is why Iraq? Why not other countries? I think it's all about oil. That's where our resources are. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. But we know North Korea has them, and we're not doing anything about it. I don't think the government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace. But I'm not sure that'll happen.",
            "Okay, so, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I really think it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it might even be biological, not just something about how you were raised.  So, to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control just seems wrong to me.  It feels kind of inhumane.  I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal thing, something that affects families and individuals, not the state. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though - walking their dogs, hanging out, you know? \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to define marriage in his own way. It's like he's playing God. \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be linked to something in your brain, like a biological predisposition. It's not about growing up with certain siblings or a lack of a father figure, it's more about something you're born with.\n\nBesides the obvious reason, it's just that marriage is something a guy and a girl can do secretly if they want to. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, like front-page news. It should be a private matter, not something the whole country is involved in.",
            "Okay, so basically, when you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's public knowledge.  As a resident advisor, I've actually dealt with this before.  \n\nWhat you post online can definitely shape how people perceive you. If you're talking about violence, like blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that out into the world. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on MySpace, you get their updates. The school wouldn't have gotten a bulletin directly; someone went to the school with this information. They had to act on it because they can't just ignore it, especially after something like 9/11.  You don't want them to be unprepared if something were to happen.\n\nHowever, it's tough to know what to take seriously because some people might just be joking around. Maybe it was a social experiment gone wrong for a class, or maybe it was something really serious.  \n\nIn one situation at our school, someone overheard a conversation and reported it. When they finally found the person, they looked through his Facebook and found some things that seemed harmless but became concerning given the situation.\n\nThe point is, once you put something online, there's no real privacy anymore. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. If you don't want people to see it or interpret it a certain way, you can't control that.\nSchools shouldn't be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.  They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if it's brought to their attention, that's a different story.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for way too long. Sure, the initial goal of spreading democracy to a country lacking it seemed good at the start. But, honestly, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove how powerful we are. I also wonder about the motives behind the war in the first place. There were those old conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, so maybe that played a part.  I mean, if the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country under a terrible leader, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But if personal grudges were involved, then that wouldn't be right. \n\nRegardless, the war has gone on for far too long. We made our point in those first few months when we launched the invasion. It was a powerful statement.  But it's been years now, and I think it's time to end it.  Maybe we were right to start the war, but I don't think our reasons have stayed clear. It feels like we're stuck in a never-ending conflict, just trying to win at all costs. \n\nIt's just not right to keep fighting this war forever. These people need to learn to govern themselves eventually, and that time is now. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while we have so many problems here at home. Poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—these are things that need our attention and resources. It's a huge drain on our economy, and it's happening for a cause that we've long since lost sight of.  \n\nWe need to stop spending billions on war and start investing in our own country. There are so many pressing issues that need our attention, and this war is just dragging us down.",
            "So, I'm curious about this situation. Was it stopped because someone stumbled upon information online?  Okay, so I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. Sure, you need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it when you add them as a friend.  Honestly, anything you put online should be seen as public knowledge. So, I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough though because you can't have someone constantly watching everyone's profiles to prevent problems. It would be discriminatory to target \"bad kids\" and focus on them. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to constantly monitor people's online activity. It depends on the situation though. Were they randomly looking at profiles, or were they specifically searching for evidence of something? I just don't know.\n\nI don't have Myspace personally, but I do have Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see all sorts of things about me. I saw a news story about a guy who easily found a girl's screen name and started IMing her, arranging to meet her within minutes. Obviously, I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes message me on IM who I don't recognize. They know my interests, what I look like, and even my class schedule. They know a lot about you from your profile. I try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I want to connect with friends. It's a tough balance.  You have to be careful who you let see your stuff.\n\nMy roommate told me about her high school banning Myspace. I didn't understand how they had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It felt a bit strange to me.",
            "I feel kinda hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who say they were always against it.  I mean, it's pretty obvious now that it was a bad idea, except for the people in charge who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls.  Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the rest of the world, people think it was a mistake.  Even most of the US troops over there think it was a bad idea and want us to leave. \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from the start.  Even before we invaded, things were bad, and now getting out is just going to be another disaster.  \n\nIt all comes down to the clash between American culture and the Middle East. The gap is just too big.  Our leaders think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly. It's like quicksand - once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay there.  The administration probably has some ideas, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually over a year or so, I guess I could understand that.  But I just don't see why we can't leave now.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone this year, and a quarter want us to leave immediately.  They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know best.\n\nAt least if we ask them and they say yes, it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say we were willing to stay, but they chose to leave.  \n\nIt won't make us heroes, but it's better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in. For example, women still face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposed to be a reality, they often find it hard to get promoted to higher positions. Men might be less likely to work under a woman because of how society has always been. \n\nSo, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not choose her simply because historically, women haven't been in leadership roles in business. It's the same for men, though. Like in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, there are expectations based on gender.\n\nIt's uncommon for a male to stay at home while his wife works, and people sometimes judge them for it. Society thinks the man should be the breadwinner, even if it's not what works best for the family.\n\nAnd in the fashion industry, straight men sometimes get dismissed as not being serious about fashion because society stereotypes men in the industry as having a certain lifestyle. People might wonder if they really understand fashion if they don't fit that stereotype.\n\nBasically, depending on the field, there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has these ingrained ideas. We've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow.\n\nThe good news is that things are slowly getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in business. More stay-at-home dads are accepted because people see that it works for some families. And maybe people in fashion are starting to realize that men can have valid opinions about fashion too.\n\nI think the key is to keep promoting the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. We can't force change, but if we highlight the strengths of those who are often overlooked, it will help shift attitudes.  We've already come so far, and with time, things will continue to improve.",
            "So, they didn't actually make marijuana legal.  They decriminalized it, meaning it's no longer a criminal offense.  Think of it like a traffic ticket instead of a serious arrest. You get cited, but you don't get booked or thrown in jail.\n\nNow, even though it's decriminalized, there are still worries about the long-term effects on things like job interviews. Those are the scary parts of a drug charge that don't disappear just because it's not a criminal offense anymore.\n\nBut, there's a financial aspect too. Arresting, booking, and processing people for marijuana offenses is incredibly expensive. There are court costs, public defenders, and state attorney fees. It all adds up!\n\nFor towns struggling financially, that cost is a big deal. Some places are just against marijuana, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize it. Maybe they can use that saved money on schools, social programs, or helping the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana openly sold everywhere, like cigarettes.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it's still considered taboo in many situations.\n\nAs for the effects, alcohol probably messes with your motor skills more, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. They both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things in moderation, while others struggle.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of Catholic traditions are very old and they've been practiced for a long time.  It's good to have those traditions, but it's also important to be open to change.  A lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week and there are strict rules about how things are done. Sometimes, it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules exactly and doesn't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics or people of other religions.  For example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths.  We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic belief, but it feels hypocritical to say that and then not accept people in that way.\n\nIt seems like Catholic teachings encourage certain things, but the way things are actually practiced often goes against those teachings because they're so old-fashioned. They just stick with them anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests who are abusive. It's a different problem. It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\nIt's hard to say, but I think people who abuse children would probably still do it even if they were married. It's about the power dynamic and the abuse itself, not about whether or not someone is married.  I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent this kind of abuse. It would probably still happen.",
            "Okay, so I'm still figuring this whole thing out. I haven't decided where I stand on this issue yet. It's really tough to say if either side is right or wrong because it's such a complicated topic. It's right on the edge of separation of church and state, and figuring out what marriage really means is super tricky without upsetting anyone. I don't know, but I think maybe civil unions are the way to go. It makes me wonder if the government should even be defining marriage, especially since it's considered a sacred thing by some. After all, the government doesn't give tax breaks or special treatment to people just because they were baptized, right? So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together. It's about their commitment to each other, not about the government getting involved in their religious beliefs.\n\nAnd about gay marriage... I think it gets complicated because it ties into all this stuff about separation of church and state. If it's a civil union, it should be treated the same as any other, regardless of who's involved.\n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That seems totally overboard. It just feels wrong to change the Constitution just for this.  It's a big deal for some people, but is it really big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment? I don't think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I have lots of gay friends, but I'm not sure I personally agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal.  I don't think it's something the whole country should be arguing about. I feel like each state should decide for themselves instead of leaving it up to the president.\n\nYou see, some states are more liberal, and others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it makes sense that you'd accept their stance on the issue. Choosing to live in a certain state means accepting their values, right?\n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, for that reason, I think gay marriage should be legal, but it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI don't think the president should be able to make that call for the whole country. It's not fair for him to impose his views on everyone.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each one is run.  Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway!  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just create more back-and-forth. It's much simpler if each state makes its own choice – they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.",
            "So, I don't think it's a big deal that school officials checked out what students posted on Myspace. I mean, Myspace is public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see.  If you put something on there, you have to realize that people will see it, even if it's not your parents or friends. That includes school officials, even if they're not looking at it under the school's name. They could easily see it from their own homes.  \n\nLook, preventing school shootings is super important. Keeping students safe is a big responsibility for schools, and if looking at Myspace helps them do that, then I'm okay with it.  \n\nNow, I get that it can feel like an invasion of privacy if teachers are constantly checking Myspace just to catch kids doing something wrong. Like, if they're digging through profiles looking for evidence of drinking or smoking, that's different. But if they have a reason to believe something is wrong and they use Myspace to investigate, I think that's fair.  \n\nThink about it: If you post something online, even an email, you have to be careful because it can come back to haunt you later. Everything you put out there stays out there forever.  \n\nIt's like a teacher told me - they have to do these things to keep the school safe. They have to be prepared for anything, just like they practice lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. It's all about making sure everyone stays safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted payback, you know? I thought going over there and causing as much trouble as they did here was the right thing to do. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We rushed into it unprepared, without a real plan. It feels like everything backfired. \n\nHonestly, I was all for it at the time, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. I feel like as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they won't be focusing on us.  \n\nBeing over there isn't helping; it just seems like a pointless mess. Because of 9/11, I just don't care about what happens over there anymore. It's hard to even think of those people as human, the way they fight and can't seem to get along.\n\nWe went in there totally blind; we didn't know what we were facing.  Their idea of war is so different from ours. They're savage, and I don't think they want to build a better country; they just want us out.\n\nMaybe we should just leave. I think we were more hyped up than rational. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change everything. It felt like we were looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it after 9/11.\n\nI get where he was coming from, though. After what happened, we couldn't just ignore it. But I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear about what we were trying to achieve, and there was no unity. We didn't know what we were getting into.\n\nIt seems like everything was driven by emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. I think they'll always be like that. I don't know what else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but it's not enough to justify staying. I think no matter how long we're there, it'll collapse when we leave. We can't stay forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize its views in a few ways. They've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of many things.  For example, they have strong opinions on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are fine, but those views seem a bit outdated. If they were more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't worry about losing people. I've heard that some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues. They feel the Church is wrong on certain subjects.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that teaches it's completely wrong. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to be part of a church that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  It's hard to say if those changes would have prevented the recent scandals, though. Maybe they would have, maybe not.  \n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have both a job and a family.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I think it's wrong to judge someone for who they love.  Whether someone is born that way or it develops over time, it's not a choice they make, so they shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nHonestly, I haven't really thought about it too much, but it feels wrong to me.  It's like being born straight versus being born gay – you don't choose either one.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue, and I don't know if it's even a moral issue. It just feels like the government shouldn't be telling people who they can and can't love.  \n\nIt's not like gay people are doing something wrong or making a bad choice. They are who they are, and they shouldn't be treated any differently.",
            "So, I really think gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, I don't see a good reason against it. Some folks worry that gay couples are a threat to traditional families, but that just doesn't make sense to me. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're both fruits, but totally different. \n\nPlus, there are tons of important civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick, because they're not legally recognized as family.  Seems unfair, right?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's all about love and commitment.  \n\nWhat really gets me is that people think gay couples are asking for special treatment. They're not trying to get married in a church; they just want the legal recognition and protections that come with a marriage certificate. If the government's not involved in church matters, why should religion dictate who can and can't get married?\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. \n\nAnd let's talk about adoption and kids. Some folks worry about how gay parents will raise their kids, but honestly, good parenting comes down to love and support, not sexual orientation. \n\nThe truth is, some kids of gay parents face bullying and discrimination. It's heartbreaking.  \n\nI think the federal government needs to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. We need to treat everyone equally. We can't let religious beliefs dictate the law and deny people their basic rights.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it makes me think about this whole marijuana thing. Just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. I mean, there are tons of drugs we use in pharmacies that are illegal for the general public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet, you know? Those are all controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have medical benefits.  It feels wrong to say marijuana is totally off-limits just because it has a bad reputation.\n\nI get that some people worry about marijuana being abused, just like alcohol.  But honestly, I think we need to ditch the whole \"marijuana is the devil\" image. It's not as harmful as heroin or cocaine. If we stopped seeing it as this scary, dangerous drug, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\n\nMaybe we should try legalizing it gradually, not all at once. That way, we can make sure people are using it safely.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. But now, as I've gotten older, they've created a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the beach, or families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other changes, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. That's the church I know. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but that's just my experience. \n\nAbout those accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests marry would have stopped them. There are married men who become pedophiles too, and they still have attractions to young children.  I think it's about the individual, not whether or not they're allowed to get married. Becoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions where priests can be married. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they should maybe consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. I don't think people just become that way. It's something they're born with. It might have something to do with upbringing in some cases, but I think genetics play a big role. You can't hide that with marriage. You may try, but it usually comes out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, then shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Honestly, I'm still bothered by the whole Iraq War thing. Sure, at first, I kinda understood it, everyone was on edge after 9/11, but I think we rushed into it for the wrong reasons. The Bush administration kept saying it was all about Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction, but we later found out that was a bunch of lies. That really rubs me the wrong way.  It feels like they straight-up lied to the American people, and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has since said he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then.  That's just wrong, in my opinion. It's like they don't care about the Constitution or anything. \n\nI get the feeling they wanted to go to war from the start. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book after he was basically pushed out of his job? He said the younger Bush came in wanting revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened with his dad. Plus, I think they were hoping to secure our energy supply, which is pretty shady.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably cause chaos with a civil war breaking out and even more people dying. But bringing in other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help out? That doesn't seem like a good solution either. It's going to mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and honestly, I don't think their government is working anyway. The Parliament seems useless, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any power. And don't even get me started on that extremist group, the one we were fighting not too long ago. They're now in Parliament with a bunch of seats. It's all so complicated, and I don't have all the answers.",
            "I'm not sure exactly how I feel about the war in Iraq.  It feels pointless, like it was just a way for us to get back at them for 9/11. I don't really follow the news about it, so I don't know all the details.  But my understanding is we're trying to build democracy there, kind of like making it another part of the US, and also to get access to their oil. But staying there just makes everyone upset.  \n\nBuilding a democracy takes a long time, and if we leave they'll be angry because they feel like we messed things up and abandoned them.  It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, this whole thing is really complicated. I don't know if it's right to keep sending our troops there, even though it's important to help those people. It feels like we're wasting our resources, and it's making President Bush look bad. We're starting to sound like we're just trying to show off our strength and power, like the Vietnam War.  \n\nI also think about the families of the soldiers who are in Iraq. I want them to come home safely, but I also worry about the people of Iraq and the impact of our presence on their lives and culture. \n\nWhat if we're just making things worse by trying to force our ideas on them? Maybe it's best to leave and let them find their own way, even if it's painful. This whole war seems like it's going to drag on for years and years. I just don't know what the right answer is.",
            "I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be going against what's already been written in stone. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another, because most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some areas like Boston. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they're thinking about making an amendment, I think it would be wrong and go against what's already been established. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason for an amendment banning it, other than personal views. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or anything else. It might even be positive for society.",
            "Ok, so the war in Iraq. To be honest, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about the reasons we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, but really, the two weren't that connected.  But the government played on people's emotions after 9/11,  and that's how the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. And I think this war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War. We should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's horrible. I think the government wasn't prepared for the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government. They weren't ready for the power vacuum and the unrest.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – we tried to push out Communism and install democracy, and it was a long, hard struggle. We should have known it wouldn't be a quick victory. In Vietnam, no matter how many people supported us, there were always insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people.\n\nSo, first, I think we shouldn't have gone to war at all. But if we're going to, we need to plan for everything. I don't think the government was prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. We're trying to train the Iraqi police and army, but it's a slow process.\n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, successful mission. But it takes years to build a new government.  Look at our own country – democracy took a long time to develop.  It wasn't easy.\n\n\nI think the government made it seem like it would be easy to change Iraq. \n\nIt's hard because we've been there so long. How can we just abandon them now after taking their government and way of life? But we also have to consider the cost in American lives. How many is too many?  \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is why Iraq? Why not other countries? I think it's all about oil. That's where our resources are. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. But we know North Korea has them, and we're not doing anything about it. I don't think the government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace. But I'm not sure that'll happen.",
            "Okay, so, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I really think it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it might even be biological, not just something about how you were raised.  So, to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control just seems wrong to me.  It feels kind of inhumane.  I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal thing, something that affects families and individuals, not the state. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though - walking their dogs, hanging out, you know? \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to define marriage in his own way. It's like he's playing God. \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be linked to something in your brain, like a biological predisposition. It's not about growing up with certain siblings or a lack of a father figure, it's more about something you're born with.\n\nBesides the obvious reason, it's just that marriage is something a guy and a girl can do secretly if they want to. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, like front-page news. It should be a private matter, not something the whole country is involved in.",
            "Okay, so basically, when you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's public knowledge.  As a resident advisor, I've actually dealt with this before.  \n\nWhat you post online can definitely shape how people perceive you. If you're talking about violence, like blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that out into the world. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on MySpace, you get their updates. The school wouldn't have gotten a bulletin directly; someone went to the school with this information. They had to act on it because they can't just ignore it, especially after something like 9/11.  You don't want them to be unprepared if something were to happen.\n\nHowever, it's tough to know what to take seriously because some people might just be joking around. Maybe it was a social experiment gone wrong for a class, or maybe it was something really serious.  \n\nIn one situation at our school, someone overheard a conversation and reported it. When they finally found the person, they looked through his Facebook and found some things that seemed harmless but became concerning given the situation.\n\nThe point is, once you put something online, there's no real privacy anymore. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. If you don't want people to see it or interpret it a certain way, you can't control that.\nSchools shouldn't be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.  They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if it's brought to their attention, that's a different story.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for way too long. Sure, the initial goal of spreading democracy to a country lacking it seemed good at the start. But, honestly, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove how powerful we are. I also wonder about the motives behind the war in the first place. There were those old conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, so maybe that played a part.  I mean, if the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country under a terrible leader, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But if personal grudges were involved, then that wouldn't be right. \n\nRegardless, the war has gone on for far too long. We made our point in those first few months when we launched the invasion. It was a powerful statement.  But it's been years now, and I think it's time to end it.  Maybe we were right to start the war, but I don't think our reasons have stayed clear. It feels like we're stuck in a never-ending conflict, just trying to win at all costs. \n\nIt's just not right to keep fighting this war forever. These people need to learn to govern themselves eventually, and that time is now. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while we have so many problems here at home. Poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—these are things that need our attention and resources. It's a huge drain on our economy, and it's happening for a cause that we've long since lost sight of.  \n\nWe need to stop spending billions on war and start investing in our own country. There are so many pressing issues that need our attention, and this war is just dragging us down.",
            "So, I'm curious about this situation. Was it stopped because someone stumbled upon information online?  Okay, so I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. Sure, you need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it when you add them as a friend.  Honestly, anything you put online should be seen as public knowledge. So, I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough though because you can't have someone constantly watching everyone's profiles to prevent problems. It would be discriminatory to target \"bad kids\" and focus on them. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to constantly monitor people's online activity. It depends on the situation though. Were they randomly looking at profiles, or were they specifically searching for evidence of something? I just don't know.\n\nI don't have Myspace personally, but I do have Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see all sorts of things about me. I saw a news story about a guy who easily found a girl's screen name and started IMing her, arranging to meet her within minutes. Obviously, I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes message me on IM who I don't recognize. They know my interests, what I look like, and even my class schedule. They know a lot about you from your profile. I try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I want to connect with friends. It's a tough balance.  You have to be careful who you let see your stuff.\n\nMy roommate told me about her high school banning Myspace. I didn't understand how they had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It felt a bit strange to me.",
            "I feel kinda hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who say they were always against it.  I mean, it's pretty obvious now that it was a bad idea, except for the people in charge who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls.  Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the rest of the world, people think it was a mistake.  Even most of the US troops over there think it was a bad idea and want us to leave. \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from the start.  Even before we invaded, things were bad, and now getting out is just going to be another disaster.  \n\nIt all comes down to the clash between American culture and the Middle East. The gap is just too big.  Our leaders think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly. It's like quicksand - once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay there.  The administration probably has some ideas, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually over a year or so, I guess I could understand that.  But I just don't see why we can't leave now.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone this year, and a quarter want us to leave immediately.  They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know best.\n\nAt least if we ask them and they say yes, it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say we were willing to stay, but they chose to leave.  \n\nIt won't make us heroes, but it's better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in. For example, women still face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposed to be a reality, they often find it hard to get promoted to higher positions. Men might be less likely to work under a woman because of how society has always been. \n\nSo, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not choose her simply because historically, women haven't been in leadership roles in business. It's the same for men, though. Like in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, there are expectations based on gender.\n\nIt's uncommon for a male to stay at home while his wife works, and people sometimes judge them for it. Society thinks the man should be the breadwinner, even if it's not what works best for the family.\n\nAnd in the fashion industry, straight men sometimes get dismissed as not being serious about fashion because society stereotypes men in the industry as having a certain lifestyle. People might wonder if they really understand fashion if they don't fit that stereotype.\n\nBasically, depending on the field, there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has these ingrained ideas. We've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow.\n\nThe good news is that things are slowly getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in business. More stay-at-home dads are accepted because people see that it works for some families. And maybe people in fashion are starting to realize that men can have valid opinions about fashion too.\n\nI think the key is to keep promoting the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. We can't force change, but if we highlight the strengths of those who are often overlooked, it will help shift attitudes.  We've already come so far, and with time, things will continue to improve.",
            "So, they didn't actually make marijuana legal.  They decriminalized it, meaning it's no longer a criminal offense.  Think of it like a traffic ticket instead of a serious arrest. You get cited, but you don't get booked or thrown in jail.\n\nNow, even though it's decriminalized, there are still worries about the long-term effects on things like job interviews. Those are the scary parts of a drug charge that don't disappear just because it's not a criminal offense anymore.\n\nBut, there's a financial aspect too. Arresting, booking, and processing people for marijuana offenses is incredibly expensive. There are court costs, public defenders, and state attorney fees. It all adds up!\n\nFor towns struggling financially, that cost is a big deal. Some places are just against marijuana, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize it. Maybe they can use that saved money on schools, social programs, or helping the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana openly sold everywhere, like cigarettes.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it's still considered taboo in many situations.\n\nAs for the effects, alcohol probably messes with your motor skills more, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. They both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things in moderation, while others struggle.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of Catholic traditions are very old and they've been practiced for a long time.  It's good to have those traditions, but it's also important to be open to change.  A lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week and there are strict rules about how things are done. Sometimes, it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules exactly and doesn't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics or people of other religions.  For example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths.  We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic belief, but it feels hypocritical to say that and then not accept people in that way.\n\nIt seems like Catholic teachings encourage certain things, but the way things are actually practiced often goes against those teachings because they're so old-fashioned. They just stick with them anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests who are abusive. It's a different problem. It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\nIt's hard to say, but I think people who abuse children would probably still do it even if they were married. It's about the power dynamic and the abuse itself, not about whether or not someone is married.  I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent this kind of abuse. It would probably still happen.",
            "Okay, so I'm still figuring this whole thing out. I haven't decided where I stand on this issue yet. It's really tough to say if either side is right or wrong because it's such a complicated topic. It's right on the edge of separation of church and state, and figuring out what marriage really means is super tricky without upsetting anyone. I don't know, but I think maybe civil unions are the way to go. It makes me wonder if the government should even be defining marriage, especially since it's considered a sacred thing by some. After all, the government doesn't give tax breaks or special treatment to people just because they were baptized, right? So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together. It's about their commitment to each other, not about the government getting involved in their religious beliefs.\n\nAnd about gay marriage... I think it gets complicated because it ties into all this stuff about separation of church and state. If it's a civil union, it should be treated the same as any other, regardless of who's involved.\n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That seems totally overboard. It just feels wrong to change the Constitution just for this.  It's a big deal for some people, but is it really big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment? I don't think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I have lots of gay friends, but I'm not sure I personally agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal.  I don't think it's something the whole country should be arguing about. I feel like each state should decide for themselves instead of leaving it up to the president.\n\nYou see, some states are more liberal, and others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it makes sense that you'd accept their stance on the issue. Choosing to live in a certain state means accepting their values, right?\n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, for that reason, I think gay marriage should be legal, but it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI don't think the president should be able to make that call for the whole country. It's not fair for him to impose his views on everyone.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each one is run.  Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway!  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just create more back-and-forth. It's much simpler if each state makes its own choice – they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.",
            "So, I don't think it's a big deal that school officials checked out what students posted on Myspace. I mean, Myspace is public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see.  If you put something on there, you have to realize that people will see it, even if it's not your parents or friends. That includes school officials, even if they're not looking at it under the school's name. They could easily see it from their own homes.  \n\nLook, preventing school shootings is super important. Keeping students safe is a big responsibility for schools, and if looking at Myspace helps them do that, then I'm okay with it.  \n\nNow, I get that it can feel like an invasion of privacy if teachers are constantly checking Myspace just to catch kids doing something wrong. Like, if they're digging through profiles looking for evidence of drinking or smoking, that's different. But if they have a reason to believe something is wrong and they use Myspace to investigate, I think that's fair.  \n\nThink about it: If you post something online, even an email, you have to be careful because it can come back to haunt you later. Everything you put out there stays out there forever.  \n\nIt's like a teacher told me - they have to do these things to keep the school safe. They have to be prepared for anything, just like they practice lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. It's all about making sure everyone stays safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted payback, you know? I thought going over there and causing as much trouble as they did here was the right thing to do. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We rushed into it unprepared, without a real plan. It feels like everything backfired. \n\nHonestly, I was all for it at the time, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. I feel like as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they won't be focusing on us.  \n\nBeing over there isn't helping; it just seems like a pointless mess. Because of 9/11, I just don't care about what happens over there anymore. It's hard to even think of those people as human, the way they fight and can't seem to get along.\n\nWe went in there totally blind; we didn't know what we were facing.  Their idea of war is so different from ours. They're savage, and I don't think they want to build a better country; they just want us out.\n\nMaybe we should just leave. I think we were more hyped up than rational. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change everything. It felt like we were looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it after 9/11.\n\nI get where he was coming from, though. After what happened, we couldn't just ignore it. But I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear about what we were trying to achieve, and there was no unity. We didn't know what we were getting into.\n\nIt seems like everything was driven by emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. I think they'll always be like that. I don't know what else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but it's not enough to justify staying. I think no matter how long we're there, it'll collapse when we leave. We can't stay forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize its views in a few ways. They've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of many things.  For example, they have strong opinions on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are fine, but those views seem a bit outdated. If they were more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't worry about losing people. I've heard that some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues. They feel the Church is wrong on certain subjects.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that teaches it's completely wrong. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to be part of a church that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married.  It's hard to say if those changes would have prevented the recent scandals, though. Maybe they would have, maybe not.  \n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have both a job and a family.  Why can't priests have both?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage. I think it's wrong to judge someone for who they love.  Whether someone is born that way or it develops over time, it's not a choice they make, so they shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It just doesn't seem fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nHonestly, I haven't really thought about it too much, but it feels wrong to me.  It's like being born straight versus being born gay – you don't choose either one.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved. It's not a legal issue, and I don't know if it's even a moral issue. It just feels like the government shouldn't be telling people who they can and can't love.  \n\nIt's not like gay people are doing something wrong or making a bad choice. They are who they are, and they shouldn't be treated any differently.",
            "So, I really think gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, I don't see a good reason against it. Some folks worry that gay couples are a threat to traditional families, but that just doesn't make sense to me. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're both fruits, but totally different. \n\nPlus, there are tons of important civil rights tied to marriage, like healthcare and property rights. If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick, because they're not legally recognized as family.  Seems unfair, right?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's all about love and commitment.  \n\nWhat really gets me is that people think gay couples are asking for special treatment. They're not trying to get married in a church; they just want the legal recognition and protections that come with a marriage certificate. If the government's not involved in church matters, why should religion dictate who can and can't get married?\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. \n\nAnd let's talk about adoption and kids. Some folks worry about how gay parents will raise their kids, but honestly, good parenting comes down to love and support, not sexual orientation. \n\nThe truth is, some kids of gay parents face bullying and discrimination. It's heartbreaking.  \n\nI think the federal government needs to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. We need to treat everyone equally. We can't let religious beliefs dictate the law and deny people their basic rights.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it makes me think about this whole marijuana thing. Just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. I mean, there are tons of drugs we use in pharmacies that are illegal for the general public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet, you know? Those are all controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have medical benefits.  It feels wrong to say marijuana is totally off-limits just because it has a bad reputation.\n\nI get that some people worry about marijuana being abused, just like alcohol.  But honestly, I think we need to ditch the whole \"marijuana is the devil\" image. It's not as harmful as heroin or cocaine. If we stopped seeing it as this scary, dangerous drug, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\n\nMaybe we should try legalizing it gradually, not all at once. That way, we can make sure people are using it safely.",
            "I think the church has definitely changed to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday, always dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. But now, as I've gotten older, they've created a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the beach, or families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\nAs for other changes, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. That's the church I know. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but that's just my experience. \n\nAbout those accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests marry would have stopped them. There are married men who become pedophiles too, and they still have attractions to young children.  I think it's about the individual, not whether or not they're allowed to get married. Becoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions where priests can be married. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they should maybe consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. I don't think people just become that way. It's something they're born with. It might have something to do with upbringing in some cases, but I think genetics play a big role. You can't hide that with marriage. You may try, but it usually comes out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, then shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Honestly, I'm still bothered by the whole Iraq War thing. Sure, at first, I kinda understood it, everyone was on edge after 9/11, but I think we rushed into it for the wrong reasons. The Bush administration kept saying it was all about Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction, but we later found out that was a bunch of lies. That really rubs me the wrong way.  It feels like they straight-up lied to the American people, and they haven't even admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has since said he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then.  That's just wrong, in my opinion. It's like they don't care about the Constitution or anything. \n\nI get the feeling they wanted to go to war from the start. Remember that Treasury Secretary who wrote a book after he was basically pushed out of his job? He said the younger Bush came in wanting revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened with his dad. Plus, I think they were hoping to secure our energy supply, which is pretty shady.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would probably cause chaos with a civil war breaking out and even more people dying. But bringing in other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help out? That doesn't seem like a good solution either. It's going to mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and honestly, I don't think their government is working anyway. The Parliament seems useless, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any power. And don't even get me started on that extremist group, the one we were fighting not too long ago. They're now in Parliament with a bunch of seats. It's all so complicated, and I don't have all the answers.",
            "I'm not sure exactly how I feel about the war in Iraq.  It feels pointless, like it was just a way for us to get back at them for 9/11. I don't really follow the news about it, so I don't know all the details.  But my understanding is we're trying to build democracy there, kind of like making it another part of the US, and also to get access to their oil. But staying there just makes everyone upset.  \n\nBuilding a democracy takes a long time, and if we leave they'll be angry because they feel like we messed things up and abandoned them.  It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, this whole thing is really complicated. I don't know if it's right to keep sending our troops there, even though it's important to help those people. It feels like we're wasting our resources, and it's making President Bush look bad. We're starting to sound like we're just trying to show off our strength and power, like the Vietnam War.  \n\nI also think about the families of the soldiers who are in Iraq. I want them to come home safely, but I also worry about the people of Iraq and the impact of our presence on their lives and culture. \n\nWhat if we're just making things worse by trying to force our ideas on them? Maybe it's best to leave and let them find their own way, even if it's painful. This whole war seems like it's going to drag on for years and years. I just don't know what the right answer is.",
            "I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches because the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be going against what's already been written in stone. So, I think those trying to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another, because most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some areas like Boston. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even though they're thinking about making an amendment, I think it would be wrong and go against what's already been established. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's because it goes against their personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There isn't a good reason for an amendment banning it, other than personal views. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy or anything else. It might even be positive for society.",
            "Ok, so the war in Iraq. To be honest, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about the reasons we went to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, but really, the two weren't that connected.  But the government played on people's emotions after 9/11,  and that's how the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. And I think this war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War. We should have learned from past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's horrible. I think the government wasn't prepared for the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government. They weren't ready for the power vacuum and the unrest.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – we tried to push out Communism and install democracy, and it was a long, hard struggle. We should have known it wouldn't be a quick victory. In Vietnam, no matter how many people supported us, there were always insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people.\n\nSo, first, I think we shouldn't have gone to war at all. But if we're going to, we need to plan for everything. I don't think the government was prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. We're trying to train the Iraqi police and army, but it's a slow process.\n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, successful mission. But it takes years to build a new government.  Look at our own country – democracy took a long time to develop.  It wasn't easy.\n\n\nI think the government made it seem like it would be easy to change Iraq. \n\nIt's hard because we've been there so long. How can we just abandon them now after taking their government and way of life? But we also have to consider the cost in American lives. How many is too many?  \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is why Iraq? Why not other countries? I think it's all about oil. That's where our resources are. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. But we know North Korea has them, and we're not doing anything about it. I don't think the government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace. But I'm not sure that'll happen.",
            "Okay, so, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I really think it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it might even be biological, not just something about how you were raised.  So, to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control just seems wrong to me.  It feels kind of inhumane.  I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal thing, something that affects families and individuals, not the state. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though - walking their dogs, hanging out, you know? \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to define marriage in his own way. It's like he's playing God. \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be linked to something in your brain, like a biological predisposition. It's not about growing up with certain siblings or a lack of a father figure, it's more about something you're born with.\n\nBesides the obvious reason, it's just that marriage is something a guy and a girl can do secretly if they want to. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a huge deal, like front-page news. It should be a private matter, not something the whole country is involved in.",
            "Okay, so basically, when you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's public knowledge.  As a resident advisor, I've actually dealt with this before.  \n\nWhat you post online can definitely shape how people perceive you. If you're talking about violence, like blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that out into the world. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on MySpace, you get their updates. The school wouldn't have gotten a bulletin directly; someone went to the school with this information. They had to act on it because they can't just ignore it, especially after something like 9/11.  You don't want them to be unprepared if something were to happen.\n\nHowever, it's tough to know what to take seriously because some people might just be joking around. Maybe it was a social experiment gone wrong for a class, or maybe it was something really serious.  \n\nIn one situation at our school, someone overheard a conversation and reported it. When they finally found the person, they looked through his Facebook and found some things that seemed harmless but became concerning given the situation.\n\nThe point is, once you put something online, there's no real privacy anymore. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. If you don't want people to see it or interpret it a certain way, you can't control that.\nSchools shouldn't be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.  They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if it's brought to their attention, that's a different story.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on for way too long. Sure, the initial goal of spreading democracy to a country lacking it seemed good at the start. But, honestly, I think we've lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove how powerful we are. I also wonder about the motives behind the war in the first place. There were those old conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, so maybe that played a part.  I mean, if the goal was truly to bring democracy to a country under a terrible leader, that would be a justifiable reason for war. But if personal grudges were involved, then that wouldn't be right. \n\nRegardless, the war has gone on for far too long. We made our point in those first few months when we launched the invasion. It was a powerful statement.  But it's been years now, and I think it's time to end it.  Maybe we were right to start the war, but I don't think our reasons have stayed clear. It feels like we're stuck in a never-ending conflict, just trying to win at all costs. \n\nIt's just not right to keep fighting this war forever. These people need to learn to govern themselves eventually, and that time is now. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war while we have so many problems here at home. Poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—these are things that need our attention and resources. It's a huge drain on our economy, and it's happening for a cause that we've long since lost sight of.  \n\nWe need to stop spending billions on war and start investing in our own country. There are so many pressing issues that need our attention, and this war is just dragging us down.",
            "So, I'm curious about this situation. Was it stopped because someone stumbled upon information online?  Okay, so I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. Sure, you need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it when you add them as a friend.  Honestly, anything you put online should be seen as public knowledge. So, I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough though because you can't have someone constantly watching everyone's profiles to prevent problems. It would be discriminatory to target \"bad kids\" and focus on them. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to constantly monitor people's online activity. It depends on the situation though. Were they randomly looking at profiles, or were they specifically searching for evidence of something? I just don't know.\n\nI don't have Myspace personally, but I do have Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see all sorts of things about me. I saw a news story about a guy who easily found a girl's screen name and started IMing her, arranging to meet her within minutes. Obviously, I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes message me on IM who I don't recognize. They know my interests, what I look like, and even my class schedule. They know a lot about you from your profile. I try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I want to connect with friends. It's a tough balance.  You have to be careful who you let see your stuff.\n\nMy roommate told me about her high school banning Myspace. I didn't understand how they had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It felt a bit strange to me.",
            "I feel kinda hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who say they were always against it.  I mean, it's pretty obvious now that it was a bad idea, except for the people in charge who don't want to admit they were wrong.  You can see it in the polls.  Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the rest of the world, people think it was a mistake.  Even most of the US troops over there think it was a bad idea and want us to leave. \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from the start.  Even before we invaded, things were bad, and now getting out is just going to be another disaster.  \n\nIt all comes down to the clash between American culture and the Middle East. The gap is just too big.  Our leaders think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly. It's like quicksand - once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it.  I don't see any good reason to stay there.  The administration probably has some ideas, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually over a year or so, I guess I could understand that.  But I just don't see why we can't leave now.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone this year, and a quarter want us to leave immediately.  They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to go. Maybe they know best.\n\nAt least if we ask them and they say yes, it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say we were willing to stay, but they chose to leave.  \n\nIt won't make us heroes, but it's better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. And it's not just about women. It really depends on the field you're in. For example, women still face a \"glass ceiling\" where, even though equality is supposed to be a reality, they often find it hard to get promoted to higher positions. Men might be less likely to work under a woman because of how society has always been. \n\nSo, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not choose her simply because historically, women haven't been in leadership roles in business. It's the same for men, though. Like in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, there are expectations based on gender.\n\nIt's uncommon for a male to stay at home while his wife works, and people sometimes judge them for it. Society thinks the man should be the breadwinner, even if it's not what works best for the family.\n\nAnd in the fashion industry, straight men sometimes get dismissed as not being serious about fashion because society stereotypes men in the industry as having a certain lifestyle. People might wonder if they really understand fashion if they don't fit that stereotype.\n\nBasically, depending on the field, there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has these ingrained ideas. We've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow.\n\nThe good news is that things are slowly getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in business. More stay-at-home dads are accepted because people see that it works for some families. And maybe people in fashion are starting to realize that men can have valid opinions about fashion too.\n\nI think the key is to keep promoting the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. We can't force change, but if we highlight the strengths of those who are often overlooked, it will help shift attitudes.  We've already come so far, and with time, things will continue to improve.",
            "So, they didn't actually make marijuana legal.  They decriminalized it, meaning it's no longer a criminal offense.  Think of it like a traffic ticket instead of a serious arrest. You get cited, but you don't get booked or thrown in jail.\n\nNow, even though it's decriminalized, there are still worries about the long-term effects on things like job interviews. Those are the scary parts of a drug charge that don't disappear just because it's not a criminal offense anymore.\n\nBut, there's a financial aspect too. Arresting, booking, and processing people for marijuana offenses is incredibly expensive. There are court costs, public defenders, and state attorney fees. It all adds up!\n\nFor towns struggling financially, that cost is a big deal. Some places are just against marijuana, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize it. Maybe they can use that saved money on schools, social programs, or helping the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana openly sold everywhere, like cigarettes.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it's still considered taboo in many situations.\n\nAs for the effects, alcohol probably messes with your motor skills more, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. They both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things in moderation, while others struggle.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of Catholic traditions are very old and they've been practiced for a long time.  It's good to have those traditions, but it's also important to be open to change.  A lot of Catholics feel like they have to go to church every week and there are strict rules about how things are done. Sometimes, it feels like the Catholic Church judges people who don't follow the rules exactly and doesn't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics or people of other religions.  For example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths.  We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic belief, but it feels hypocritical to say that and then not accept people in that way.\n\nIt seems like Catholic teachings encourage certain things, but the way things are actually practiced often goes against those teachings because they're so old-fashioned. They just stick with them anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests who are abusive. It's a different problem. It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\nIt's hard to say, but I think people who abuse children would probably still do it even if they were married. It's about the power dynamic and the abuse itself, not about whether or not someone is married.  I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent this kind of abuse. It would probably still happen.",
            "Okay, so I'm still figuring this whole thing out. I haven't decided where I stand on this issue yet. It's really tough to say if either side is right or wrong because it's such a complicated topic. It's right on the edge of separation of church and state, and figuring out what marriage really means is super tricky without upsetting anyone. I don't know, but I think maybe civil unions are the way to go. It makes me wonder if the government should even be defining marriage, especially since it's considered a sacred thing by some. After all, the government doesn't give tax breaks or special treatment to people just because they were baptized, right? So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together. It's about their commitment to each other, not about the government getting involved in their religious beliefs.\n\nAnd about gay marriage... I think it gets complicated because it ties into all this stuff about separation of church and state. If it's a civil union, it should be treated the same as any other, regardless of who's involved.\n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That seems totally overboard. It just feels wrong to change the Constitution just for this.  It's a big deal for some people, but is it really big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment? I don't think so.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I have lots of gay friends, but I'm not sure I personally agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal.  I don't think it's something the whole country should be arguing about. I feel like each state should decide for themselves instead of leaving it up to the president.\n\nYou see, some states are more liberal, and others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it makes sense that you'd accept their stance on the issue. Choosing to live in a certain state means accepting their values, right?\n\nI believe everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same opportunities. So, for that reason, I think gay marriage should be legal, but it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI don't think the president should be able to make that call for the whole country. It's not fair for him to impose his views on everyone.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each one is run.  Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway!  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just create more back-and-forth. It's much simpler if each state makes its own choice – they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.",
            "So, I don't think it's a big deal that school officials checked out what students posted on Myspace. I mean, Myspace is public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see.  If you put something on there, you have to realize that people will see it, even if it's not your parents or friends. That includes school officials, even if they're not looking at it under the school's name. They could easily see it from their own homes.  \n\nLook, preventing school shootings is super important. Keeping students safe is a big responsibility for schools, and if looking at Myspace helps them do that, then I'm okay with it.  \n\nNow, I get that it can feel like an invasion of privacy if teachers are constantly checking Myspace just to catch kids doing something wrong. Like, if they're digging through profiles looking for evidence of drinking or smoking, that's different. But if they have a reason to believe something is wrong and they use Myspace to investigate, I think that's fair.  \n\nThink about it: If you post something online, even an email, you have to be careful because it can come back to haunt you later. Everything you put out there stays out there forever.  \n\nIt's like a teacher told me - they have to do these things to keep the school safe. They have to be prepared for anything, just like they practice lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. It's all about making sure everyone stays safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted payback, you know? I thought going over there and causing as much trouble as they did here was the right thing to do. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. We rushed into it unprepared, without a real plan. It feels like everything backfired. \n\nHonestly, I was all for it at the time, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. I feel like as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they won't be focusing on us.  \n\nBeing over there isn't helping; it just seems like a pointless mess. Because of 9/11, I just don't care about what happens over there anymore. It's hard to even think of those people as human, the way they fight and can't seem to get along.\n\nWe went in there totally blind; we didn't know what we were facing.  Their idea of war is so different from ours. They're savage, and I don't think they want to build a better country; they just want us out.\n\nMaybe we should just leave. I think we were more hyped up than rational. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change everything. It felt like we were looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it after 9/11.\n\nI get where he was coming from, though. After what happened, we couldn't just ignore it. But I think we could have had a better plan. We weren't clear about what we were trying to achieve, and there was no unity. We didn't know what we were getting into.\n\nIt seems like everything was driven by emotion and anger, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. I think they'll always be like that. I don't know what else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but it's not enough to justify staying. I think no matter how long we're there, it'll collapse when we leave. We can't stay forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to update some of its views. I've heard they're losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but their stance feels a bit outdated. If they were more open to modern thinking, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing people.  \n\nI've heard people are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these topics.  It's understandable that someone who supports abortion or gay marriage wouldn't feel comfortable in a community that condemns those things.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they couldn't have female priests or allow priests to get married. It seems unfair that they're expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else has a family life outside of work.",
            "Okay, so, I'm not against gay marriage. I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, sexuality isn't something you choose. So, I don't think we should blame people for how they are attracted to others. You know, it seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too hard, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right. It just doesn't seem like a choice, like how some people are born straight and others gay.  It's just how they are.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not really a legal or moral issue. It's just about people being who they are. It's not like they're making a bad choice or something.\n\nIt just feels wrong to make them feel like they're doing something wrong. They shouldn't be treated differently just because of who they love.  It's not like it affects anyone else's safety or anything. It's just their personal lives.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to legalize it. Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but I think it's totally different. It's like two sides of the same coin – they're not the same, but they're connected. \n\nThere are also tons of civil rights issues tied to it. For example, if you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner might not be allowed to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital. It just doesn't seem right if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nPlus, lots of studies show that gay relationships are just as successful as straight relationships. They have the same ingredients for a happy partnership.\n\nReally, it's about marriage certificates and legal rights, not church weddings. If the government keeps religion out of it, there shouldn't be a problem.\n\nIt's kind of like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about things like adoption and how a gay couple living in their community will affect everyone. They also wonder how children of gay couples will adjust.\n\nBut honestly, it's mostly new territory. Parenting skills are the same for everyone, whether they're gay or straight.\n\nI think the federal government should get involved and make same-sex marriage legal in all states.  President Bush seems to have really strong religious views against it, which might be linked to his stance on abortion and stem cell research.  \n\nBut I think it's important to remember that morality is different for everyone.  Just because some religious groups oppose gay marriage doesn't mean the government should enforce their beliefs on everyone. \n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological problem caused by childhood trauma or a personality flaw. But the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. \n\nWe should listen to experts and research instead of just believing what's popular or what our friends tell us.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've learned a thing or two.  Just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take drugs, for instance.  I mean, making them available to the public?  Absolutely not.  But using them for medical reasons?  Definitely yes.  It's all about the context.  \n\nThink about it: there are tons of legal drugs, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, that pharmacies use all the time. They're controlled substances, but they're super helpful.  If we're okay with those, why not consider marijuana for its potential benefits?\n\nIt's not exactly like alcohol, though. Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and so can marijuana. But I think we should approach marijuana differently.  Maybe a gradual legalization process would be better, step by step, so it doesn't get out of hand.  We need to ditch the stigma surrounding marijuana first.  Once people see it's not the scary monster everyone thinks it is, they might use it responsibly.\n\nHonestly, people have such a warped view of marijuana just because it's illegal. It's not like heroin or cocaine, you know?  If we get rid of that image, people could use it responsibly. And definitely for medical purposes!",
            "I think the church has modernized to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday in cute dresses, matching shoes and a purse.  I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long.  People dress much more casually, especially in the summer, coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more relaxed. That's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped these situations. Some married men become pedophiles too. It's a personal issue, not a matter of being able to marry or not. Priests choose to become priests, and if they want to be married while practicing their faith, maybe they should consider another religion. There are religions where priests can marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  \n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. It's something people are born with, not something they choose. Marriage wouldn't change that.  If the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's terrible. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were going with the whole Iraq thing at first, but it was right after 9/11, and everyone was super shook up.  I think they used 9/11 as a way to justify going into Iraq, saying that Saddam Hussein had ties to Osama Bin Laden and weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, none of that was true, and that really rubs me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nHonestly, it feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people about everything. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has said he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a huge betrayal of trust, something that should be impeachable.  It feels like they've just been disrespecting the Constitution ever since 9/11.  \n\nI have a feeling they went into office wanting to go to war.  I remember reading a book by the Treasury Secretary, who basically said that Bush Jr. had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's dealings with him. And on top of that, I think Bush Jr. was hoping to secure more energy resources for the U.S. through the war.  It all feels very manipulative.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough.  Pulling out right now would probably cause a civil war and more deaths, though.  They're trying this thing with a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's going to create problems with Iraq's sovereignty in the long run.\n\nWith the news I've seen, the Parliament doesn't seem to be doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any control.  Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has a bunch of seats in Parliament. There are still so many radical groups fighting for power, and it's creating a lot of tension.",
            "Ugh, the War in Iraq... it's a mess. I mean, it's not even officially a war, which is kinda weird. It feels like it was all about revenge for 9/11, like we just wanted to hit back at whoever we thought did it.  I don't really follow the details, but it seems like we're just stuck there now, trying to build a democracy and get our hands on some oil. But honestly, it's just making everyone angry.  \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is taking forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad because they feel like we messed everything up. It's a lose-lose situation.  \n\nI don't know, it's a hard topic. It feels like we're using our military power to show off, like we're bigger and better. But it doesn't feel right.  We didn't even officially declare war, and now it's dragging on and on. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation where everything feels pointless.\n\nPlus, there are so many families with loved ones over there. I want them to come home safe, but it also feels wrong to stay and change their culture. It's a whole mess. I think this thing is going to keep going for years and years.",
            "Listen, I really don't think it's right for the government to make laws about this.  The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices goes against that.  It feels like picking sides, favoring one church's beliefs over another.  For example, most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in some areas like Boston.  I just don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of what allows for religious freedom in the US. Even though there's talk about making an amendment, I think that's completely wrong.  It would go against what's already in the Constitution and would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, should get involved. It seems like this push for an amendment is just based on personal beliefs, specifically the president's Catholic views. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all others.  This decision should be left up to the churches themselves.  There's no real reason for a government amendment beyond personal opinions. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else, and it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the Iraq War...  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading Iraq, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11 and used that outrage to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq War feels a lot like a repeat of Vietnam. We should have learned from our past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible.  \n\nThe US removed Iraq's government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. They were trying to install a democracy, similar to what happened in Vietnam, where we tried to push out communists and promote democracy. But the US government should have known that wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and there's no guarantee of a clear victory.\n\nIn both Vietnam and Iraq, there were always going to be insurgents, even if some people supported the US intervention. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for any of this. They should have planned for all possible outcomes before going to war.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, but it's a slow process.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war would be quick and successful, but it's far from it.  It takes time to build a new government and a stable society, as we saw in our own country's history.\n\nSo, the war in Iraq is a tough situation. We've been there for so long, it's hard to just walk away. But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice? \n\nIt also makes you wonder why we're only focused on Iraq. Why not other countries with problems, like North Korea? I think the oil issue plays a big part. We need to ask ourselves if this is really about freedom and democracy, or if it's about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. Yet, we aren't doing anything about North Korea, which we know has these weapons.  \n\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure that's going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I just think it's a personal preference, something that's becoming more and more clear is biological, not sociological. It doesn't make sense to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong to me. I've always supported gay marriage. \n\nAnd honestly, politics and government shouldn't be involved. It's not a state or national issue; it's about personal relationships and families. Like, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though — walk their dogs, hang out, you know?  It's frustrating that Bush is trying to define marriage in his own way. It just seems ridiculous.\n\nThere's so much research now showing that being gay might be biological, a chemical thing in the brain, not something you choose. It's like being predisposed to something, not a result of your upbringing.\n\nBesides the obvious, it feels like marriage is different for gay couples.  A straight couple can just elope to Vegas if they want, but a gay couple wanting to get married makes headlines.  It shouldn't be such a big deal. It's a private matter, not something that needs to be public.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal: anything you post online becomes public knowledge.  It's out there for everyone to see. As an RA, I've had to deal with this firsthand.  Whatever you put on the internet  shapes how people perceive you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that kind of stuff out into the world. The internet is global; if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nThe school didn't magically receive a bulletin; someone went to them with this information. They have to act on these kinds of threats because, imagine if something happened, and they could have prevented it. \n\nBut it's a tricky situation because you don't always know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a harmless joke gone wrong, like a sociology class experiment, or it could be something truly dangerous.  \n\nIn our school's case, someone overheard a conversation, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked at the student's Facebook page because some things he posted, while maybe intended as a joke, became very concerning in light of the situation.\n\nThe bottom line is, when you share things online, there's no real expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret things or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles.  It's a violation of privacy.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on way too long. At the beginning, the intention seemed good – to bring democracy to a country lacking fair political systems. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now it feels like we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. \n\nHonestly, I have doubts about the initial motives too. There were those past conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein that might have played a role.\n\nIf the goal was to help a country oppressed by a dictator achieve democracy, that would be a justifiable reason. But if personal vendettas were involved, that wouldn't be right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on far too long. We made our point in the initial months, demonstrating our military strength. But years later, it just feels excessive.\n\nI believe our original purpose has become muddled and distorted. It seems like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a decisive victory, instead of for a clear, achievable goal.\n\nIt's time to end this war. Their government and officials need to take responsibility for their own country. We've already drained our economy, spending billions on a conflict that's lost its meaning.\n\nWe have pressing issues at home – poverty, inadequate infrastructure, healthcare – that deserve our attention and funding. Spending billions on a prolonged war that has lost its purpose is draining our resources from these critical areas. \n\nWe need to stop this war and invest in our own people and our own future.",
            "Can I ask something to make sure I understand? It sounds like this situation was stopped because someone saw something online, right?\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nHonestly, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.  On sites like Myspace, if you put information out there, it's basically public knowledge. I get that on Myspace you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you accept someone as a friend, you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nSo, if you post something online, you should know that lots of people might see it. If I think that in this case, someone seeing that information online and preventing a tragedy was a good thing.\n\nThat's a tough one though.  I mean, you can't have one person constantly checking everyone's profiles at school to prevent something bad from happening. But then, if they start focusing on \"bad kids\" and looking at their profiles, that feels like discrimination.\n\nI don't think it would be fair to have someone's job be to monitor people's profiles all day.  But maybe it depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence of something specific, or were they just randomly browsing? It's hard to say.\n\n\nI don't personally have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw a news story once about a guy who could easily find people's information online. He got a girl's screen name from her profile and started talking to her on instant messenger. He managed to get her to meet him in less than a minute. \n\nPersonally, I would never do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their screen names. They know it's me, though. It's strange because they seem to know a lot about me - my interests, what I look like, even my class schedule and who my friends are. They can see all sorts of photos too. I try to be careful about what I post, but at the same time, Facebook is supposed to be a way to connect with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me. I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how the school has the right to tell students they can't use Myspace.",
            "Hmm, you know, talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical. I hate to jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start, but I was.  It's not really a big deal anymore though, because everyone pretty much agrees it was a bad idea except for those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nLook at the polls - they've done them everywhere, in the US, Iraq, even globally, and  it's pretty clear: 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad call. Eighty percent of Iraqis feel the same way, and even 70% of US troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from day one.  It was a disaster before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another disaster.  \n\nThere's just no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. It's a clash of cultures - the US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and previous ones, think they can just force democracy on a region where it doesn't fit. It's just not how those people want to live.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a complete disaster.  It's like quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons. \n\nIf they want to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that. But I just don't see why we shouldn't leave now. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better.\n\nAt least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say, \"We were going to stay, but you guys made the decision to leave.\"\n\nMaybe that would make us the \"good guys\" - not really, no, never truly. But it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. \n\nAnd it's not just about women. I think it depends on the specific field you're in. \n\nFor women, overall, I feel like they face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to exist, a lot of people still struggle to accept having a woman in a leadership position, especially if it's over a man. This is because of how society has been for so long.\n\nWomen often hit a point where they're qualified for a promotion, but the board might not choose them because of the historical stereotype that women aren't usually in leadership roles. \n\nIt's similar for men too, though. Think about things like the fashion industry or staying at home as a parent. \n\nIt's uncommon for a man to stay at home while the woman works. People sometimes judge that because society expects men to be the primary earners. But maybe the husband wants to be with the kids, and the wife has the better job. It can be really hard for them because society doesn't see it as the \"normal\" arrangement.\n\nAnd in fashion, straight men can sometimes struggle to be taken seriously.  It might sound weird, but it's probably because people associate fashion with women. If a man has a \"typical\" lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might wonder if he really understands women's fashion. \n\nBasically, I think gender discrimination exists in different ways depending on your field.\n\nChanging it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change takes time.  \n\nThe good news is, we're seeing progress. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in the business world. We're also seeing more stay-at-home dads being accepted because people are realizing that sometimes it works better that way. \n\nIt's all about showing the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. If you force things, people resist. \n\nWe're at a good point now where things are slowly changing, but it takes time.",
            "They didn't actually legalize marijuana; they decriminalized it.  That means it's not a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited instead of arrested and booked.  I think that if someone gets caught with it and gets cited, it can still have consequences for things like job interviews. Those kinds of negative impacts are usually the worst part of having a drug charge.  Even with decriminalization, people worry about those future repercussions.  \n\nBut on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest, book, and house people, plus court costs, public defenders, and the state attorney’s office. All that adds up. So when cities are struggling financially, some aren't willing to make that change, even if it would free up money for things like public education, social programs, and food assistance. Some communities just strongly oppose marijuana and don't want to decriminalize it.  \n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, might be fine with it because it frees up resources. I think it's important because marijuana shouldn't just be readily available everywhere. There are lots of reasons for that, but the financial aspect is a big one too.\n\nIf it were fully legalized, it could be like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked openly. That might lead to more people smoking and driving. Plus, marijuana is still seen as taboo in many places and contexts. Seeing it out in the open like that could feel awkward for some people.\n\nAlcohol probably has more immediate negative effects on motor skills, but for a lot of people, marijuana has a bigger impact on their lifestyle overall. Both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle moderation, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize because people react so differently to substances.",
            "I'd say, yeah, there are good and bad things about being Catholic.  They've got a lot of traditions they've stuck with for ages, and that can be nice.  It's comforting to have those roots. But, sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't adapt well to change.  Like, a lot of Catholics feel they *have* to go to church every week, and there are strict rules about everything. And, honestly, it feels like they judge people pretty harshly if they don't follow the rules perfectly. \n\nThey don't seem very accepting of people who aren't exactly like them, either.  For example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Isn't that supposed to be a loving religion?  It seems hypocritical to preach love but then turn around and reject people because they don't fit in.\n\nIt's like, they tell you to love everyone, but their actions don't always match those words.  They cling to old rules even though they don't seem to make sense in the modern world.\n\nNow, about priests getting married... I think it'd be good if they could.  But, I don't know if it would really stop the bad stuff that happens sometimes.  Those issues are way more complicated than just whether or not a priest is married. It's a sad thing that happens, and I don't think marriage would magically fix it.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this whole marriage equality issue. I honestly can't say if one side is right or wrong because it's such a complex problem. It's a real tightrope walk between separating church and state and figuring out what marriage truly means. \n\nIt's tough because defining marriage without upsetting anyone is nearly impossible. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining marriage at all, especially when it's seen as a religious sacrament.  Think about it – the government doesn't get involved in how people practice their religion, so why should they dictate who can get married? \n\nMaybe it's simpler to just see it as civil unions.  It's about two people committing to each other, regardless of their beliefs or sexual orientation. The government shouldn't care about the specifics of the ceremony, just that two people want to be together. \n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for a federal law. But, changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That just seems extreme. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for something like this, even if it's important to some people. It's not a big enough issue to warrant such a drastic change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I have lots of gay friends, so it's not a black-and-white issue. While I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a nationwide debate, though.  \n\nI think each state should decide for itself whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage.  Some states lean Democratic, and those are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that's okay with it, you're probably going to be fine with their decision. And honestly, if you choose to live somewhere, you kind of accept their views, right?\n\nI think everyone deserves equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. So, I feel strongly that the legality of gay marriage should be left up to the states.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush should have the power to ban gay marriage nationwide. It should be up to the individual states to decide what's best for them. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be making that kind of decision for everyone.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon.  If a Democratic president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth.  It's better to let each state make its own choice. After all, they're the ones who'll have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they're coming from. I mean, Myspace is basically like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see.  It doesn't matter if you're using your school's name or not, anyone can find it, even from their own homes.  \n\nI think the school officials were right to look at it. If it helps prevent something terrible like a school shooting, that's important. Protecting the students is the school's job, and if they had information about a potential threat, they had a responsibility to act.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a legitimate reason, like preventing harm, then I think it's okay.\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to say something bad about someone in an email because you never know who might read it.  Everything you put online can come back to haunt you later.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.  It's good to be able to express yourself online, but you have to be careful what you say. It's a public space, and anything you post can be seen by anyone, even the school.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was totally on board. Nine/Eleven hit me personally, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we were all just so emotional after that, we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and honestly, I think it backfired.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It feels like the people over there are so caught up in fighting each other that they'll always be at each other's throats, regardless of us being there.  \n\nIt's hard, because of Nine/Eleven, I've kind of just checked out. I don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like, they can't even get along with each other, how are they going to get better?  Sometimes I don't even think they're human, the way they fight.\n\nWe went in blind. We had no idea what we were facing. Their idea of war is so different from ours, they're just savage. I don't think they want to improve their country, they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave it alone. \n\nI think we were mostly just angry and fueled by revenge. We didn't think about the long-term consequences or how they'd react. President Bush, he probably felt pressured, like we had no choice but to declare war on Iraq after what happened.\n\nBut honestly, we should have had a better plan. We were all over the place, with no clear goals or unity. Maybe if we'd gone in with a clear strategy, things would have been different. I just feel like we were all so emotionally driven, and that's what we ended up creating over there. \n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're probably always going to be like this. I just don't know what else to say. This whole thing has dragged on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  \n\nI think no matter how long we stay, things will fall apart as soon as we leave. We can't be there forever, and I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to update some of its views. I've heard they're losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but their stance feels a bit outdated. If they were more open to modern thinking, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing people.  \n\nI've heard people are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these topics.  It's understandable that someone who supports abortion or gay marriage wouldn't feel comfortable in a community that condemns those things.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they couldn't have female priests or allow priests to get married. It seems unfair that they're expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else has a family life outside of work.",
            "Okay, so, I'm not against gay marriage. I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, sexuality isn't something you choose. So, I don't think we should blame people for how they are attracted to others. You know, it seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too hard, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right. It just doesn't seem like a choice, like how some people are born straight and others gay.  It's just how they are.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not really a legal or moral issue. It's just about people being who they are. It's not like they're making a bad choice or something.\n\nIt just feels wrong to make them feel like they're doing something wrong. They shouldn't be treated differently just because of who they love.  It's not like it affects anyone else's safety or anything. It's just their personal lives.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to legalize it. Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but I think it's totally different. It's like two sides of the same coin – they're not the same, but they're connected. \n\nThere are also tons of civil rights issues tied to it. For example, if you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner might not be allowed to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital. It just doesn't seem right if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nPlus, lots of studies show that gay relationships are just as successful as straight relationships. They have the same ingredients for a happy partnership.\n\nReally, it's about marriage certificates and legal rights, not church weddings. If the government keeps religion out of it, there shouldn't be a problem.\n\nIt's kind of like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about things like adoption and how a gay couple living in their community will affect everyone. They also wonder how children of gay couples will adjust.\n\nBut honestly, it's mostly new territory. Parenting skills are the same for everyone, whether they're gay or straight.\n\nI think the federal government should get involved and make same-sex marriage legal in all states.  President Bush seems to have really strong religious views against it, which might be linked to his stance on abortion and stem cell research.  \n\nBut I think it's important to remember that morality is different for everyone.  Just because some religious groups oppose gay marriage doesn't mean the government should enforce their beliefs on everyone. \n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological problem caused by childhood trauma or a personality flaw. But the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. \n\nWe should listen to experts and research instead of just believing what's popular or what our friends tell us.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've learned a thing or two.  Just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take drugs, for instance.  I mean, making them available to the public?  Absolutely not.  But using them for medical reasons?  Definitely yes.  It's all about the context.  \n\nThink about it: there are tons of legal drugs, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, that pharmacies use all the time. They're controlled substances, but they're super helpful.  If we're okay with those, why not consider marijuana for its potential benefits?\n\nIt's not exactly like alcohol, though. Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and so can marijuana. But I think we should approach marijuana differently.  Maybe a gradual legalization process would be better, step by step, so it doesn't get out of hand.  We need to ditch the stigma surrounding marijuana first.  Once people see it's not the scary monster everyone thinks it is, they might use it responsibly.\n\nHonestly, people have such a warped view of marijuana just because it's illegal. It's not like heroin or cocaine, you know?  If we get rid of that image, people could use it responsibly. And definitely for medical purposes!",
            "I think the church has modernized to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday in cute dresses, matching shoes and a purse.  I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long.  People dress much more casually, especially in the summer, coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more relaxed. That's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped these situations. Some married men become pedophiles too. It's a personal issue, not a matter of being able to marry or not. Priests choose to become priests, and if they want to be married while practicing their faith, maybe they should consider another religion. There are religions where priests can marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  \n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. It's something people are born with, not something they choose. Marriage wouldn't change that.  If the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's terrible. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were going with the whole Iraq thing at first, but it was right after 9/11, and everyone was super shook up.  I think they used 9/11 as a way to justify going into Iraq, saying that Saddam Hussein had ties to Osama Bin Laden and weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, none of that was true, and that really rubs me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nHonestly, it feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people about everything. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has said he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a huge betrayal of trust, something that should be impeachable.  It feels like they've just been disrespecting the Constitution ever since 9/11.  \n\nI have a feeling they went into office wanting to go to war.  I remember reading a book by the Treasury Secretary, who basically said that Bush Jr. had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's dealings with him. And on top of that, I think Bush Jr. was hoping to secure more energy resources for the U.S. through the war.  It all feels very manipulative.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough.  Pulling out right now would probably cause a civil war and more deaths, though.  They're trying this thing with a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's going to create problems with Iraq's sovereignty in the long run.\n\nWith the news I've seen, the Parliament doesn't seem to be doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any control.  Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has a bunch of seats in Parliament. There are still so many radical groups fighting for power, and it's creating a lot of tension.",
            "Ugh, the War in Iraq... it's a mess. I mean, it's not even officially a war, which is kinda weird. It feels like it was all about revenge for 9/11, like we just wanted to hit back at whoever we thought did it.  I don't really follow the details, but it seems like we're just stuck there now, trying to build a democracy and get our hands on some oil. But honestly, it's just making everyone angry.  \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is taking forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad because they feel like we messed everything up. It's a lose-lose situation.  \n\nI don't know, it's a hard topic. It feels like we're using our military power to show off, like we're bigger and better. But it doesn't feel right.  We didn't even officially declare war, and now it's dragging on and on. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation where everything feels pointless.\n\nPlus, there are so many families with loved ones over there. I want them to come home safe, but it also feels wrong to stay and change their culture. It's a whole mess. I think this thing is going to keep going for years and years.",
            "Listen, I really don't think it's right for the government to make laws about this.  The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices goes against that.  It feels like picking sides, favoring one church's beliefs over another.  For example, most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in some areas like Boston.  I just don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of what allows for religious freedom in the US. Even though there's talk about making an amendment, I think that's completely wrong.  It would go against what's already in the Constitution and would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, should get involved. It seems like this push for an amendment is just based on personal beliefs, specifically the president's Catholic views. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all others.  This decision should be left up to the churches themselves.  There's no real reason for a government amendment beyond personal opinions. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else, and it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the Iraq War...  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading Iraq, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11 and used that outrage to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq War feels a lot like a repeat of Vietnam. We should have learned from our past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible.  \n\nThe US removed Iraq's government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. They were trying to install a democracy, similar to what happened in Vietnam, where we tried to push out communists and promote democracy. But the US government should have known that wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and there's no guarantee of a clear victory.\n\nIn both Vietnam and Iraq, there were always going to be insurgents, even if some people supported the US intervention. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for any of this. They should have planned for all possible outcomes before going to war.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, but it's a slow process.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war would be quick and successful, but it's far from it.  It takes time to build a new government and a stable society, as we saw in our own country's history.\n\nSo, the war in Iraq is a tough situation. We've been there for so long, it's hard to just walk away. But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice? \n\nIt also makes you wonder why we're only focused on Iraq. Why not other countries with problems, like North Korea? I think the oil issue plays a big part. We need to ask ourselves if this is really about freedom and democracy, or if it's about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. Yet, we aren't doing anything about North Korea, which we know has these weapons.  \n\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure that's going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I just think it's a personal preference, something that's becoming more and more clear is biological, not sociological. It doesn't make sense to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong to me. I've always supported gay marriage. \n\nAnd honestly, politics and government shouldn't be involved. It's not a state or national issue; it's about personal relationships and families. Like, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though — walk their dogs, hang out, you know?  It's frustrating that Bush is trying to define marriage in his own way. It just seems ridiculous.\n\nThere's so much research now showing that being gay might be biological, a chemical thing in the brain, not something you choose. It's like being predisposed to something, not a result of your upbringing.\n\nBesides the obvious, it feels like marriage is different for gay couples.  A straight couple can just elope to Vegas if they want, but a gay couple wanting to get married makes headlines.  It shouldn't be such a big deal. It's a private matter, not something that needs to be public.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal: anything you post online becomes public knowledge.  It's out there for everyone to see. As an RA, I've had to deal with this firsthand.  Whatever you put on the internet  shapes how people perceive you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that kind of stuff out into the world. The internet is global; if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nThe school didn't magically receive a bulletin; someone went to them with this information. They have to act on these kinds of threats because, imagine if something happened, and they could have prevented it. \n\nBut it's a tricky situation because you don't always know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a harmless joke gone wrong, like a sociology class experiment, or it could be something truly dangerous.  \n\nIn our school's case, someone overheard a conversation, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked at the student's Facebook page because some things he posted, while maybe intended as a joke, became very concerning in light of the situation.\n\nThe bottom line is, when you share things online, there's no real expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret things or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles.  It's a violation of privacy.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on way too long. At the beginning, the intention seemed good – to bring democracy to a country lacking fair political systems. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now it feels like we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. \n\nHonestly, I have doubts about the initial motives too. There were those past conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein that might have played a role.\n\nIf the goal was to help a country oppressed by a dictator achieve democracy, that would be a justifiable reason. But if personal vendettas were involved, that wouldn't be right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on far too long. We made our point in the initial months, demonstrating our military strength. But years later, it just feels excessive.\n\nI believe our original purpose has become muddled and distorted. It seems like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a decisive victory, instead of for a clear, achievable goal.\n\nIt's time to end this war. Their government and officials need to take responsibility for their own country. We've already drained our economy, spending billions on a conflict that's lost its meaning.\n\nWe have pressing issues at home – poverty, inadequate infrastructure, healthcare – that deserve our attention and funding. Spending billions on a prolonged war that has lost its purpose is draining our resources from these critical areas. \n\nWe need to stop this war and invest in our own people and our own future.",
            "Can I ask something to make sure I understand? It sounds like this situation was stopped because someone saw something online, right?\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nHonestly, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.  On sites like Myspace, if you put information out there, it's basically public knowledge. I get that on Myspace you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you accept someone as a friend, you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nSo, if you post something online, you should know that lots of people might see it. If I think that in this case, someone seeing that information online and preventing a tragedy was a good thing.\n\nThat's a tough one though.  I mean, you can't have one person constantly checking everyone's profiles at school to prevent something bad from happening. But then, if they start focusing on \"bad kids\" and looking at their profiles, that feels like discrimination.\n\nI don't think it would be fair to have someone's job be to monitor people's profiles all day.  But maybe it depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence of something specific, or were they just randomly browsing? It's hard to say.\n\n\nI don't personally have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw a news story once about a guy who could easily find people's information online. He got a girl's screen name from her profile and started talking to her on instant messenger. He managed to get her to meet him in less than a minute. \n\nPersonally, I would never do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their screen names. They know it's me, though. It's strange because they seem to know a lot about me - my interests, what I look like, even my class schedule and who my friends are. They can see all sorts of photos too. I try to be careful about what I post, but at the same time, Facebook is supposed to be a way to connect with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me. I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how the school has the right to tell students they can't use Myspace.",
            "Hmm, you know, talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical. I hate to jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start, but I was.  It's not really a big deal anymore though, because everyone pretty much agrees it was a bad idea except for those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nLook at the polls - they've done them everywhere, in the US, Iraq, even globally, and  it's pretty clear: 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad call. Eighty percent of Iraqis feel the same way, and even 70% of US troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from day one.  It was a disaster before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another disaster.  \n\nThere's just no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. It's a clash of cultures - the US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and previous ones, think they can just force democracy on a region where it doesn't fit. It's just not how those people want to live.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a complete disaster.  It's like quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons. \n\nIf they want to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that. But I just don't see why we shouldn't leave now. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better.\n\nAt least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say, \"We were going to stay, but you guys made the decision to leave.\"\n\nMaybe that would make us the \"good guys\" - not really, no, never truly. But it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. \n\nAnd it's not just about women. I think it depends on the specific field you're in. \n\nFor women, overall, I feel like they face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to exist, a lot of people still struggle to accept having a woman in a leadership position, especially if it's over a man. This is because of how society has been for so long.\n\nWomen often hit a point where they're qualified for a promotion, but the board might not choose them because of the historical stereotype that women aren't usually in leadership roles. \n\nIt's similar for men too, though. Think about things like the fashion industry or staying at home as a parent. \n\nIt's uncommon for a man to stay at home while the woman works. People sometimes judge that because society expects men to be the primary earners. But maybe the husband wants to be with the kids, and the wife has the better job. It can be really hard for them because society doesn't see it as the \"normal\" arrangement.\n\nAnd in fashion, straight men can sometimes struggle to be taken seriously.  It might sound weird, but it's probably because people associate fashion with women. If a man has a \"typical\" lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might wonder if he really understands women's fashion. \n\nBasically, I think gender discrimination exists in different ways depending on your field.\n\nChanging it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change takes time.  \n\nThe good news is, we're seeing progress. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in the business world. We're also seeing more stay-at-home dads being accepted because people are realizing that sometimes it works better that way. \n\nIt's all about showing the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. If you force things, people resist. \n\nWe're at a good point now where things are slowly changing, but it takes time.",
            "They didn't actually legalize marijuana; they decriminalized it.  That means it's not a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited instead of arrested and booked.  I think that if someone gets caught with it and gets cited, it can still have consequences for things like job interviews. Those kinds of negative impacts are usually the worst part of having a drug charge.  Even with decriminalization, people worry about those future repercussions.  \n\nBut on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest, book, and house people, plus court costs, public defenders, and the state attorney’s office. All that adds up. So when cities are struggling financially, some aren't willing to make that change, even if it would free up money for things like public education, social programs, and food assistance. Some communities just strongly oppose marijuana and don't want to decriminalize it.  \n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, might be fine with it because it frees up resources. I think it's important because marijuana shouldn't just be readily available everywhere. There are lots of reasons for that, but the financial aspect is a big one too.\n\nIf it were fully legalized, it could be like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked openly. That might lead to more people smoking and driving. Plus, marijuana is still seen as taboo in many places and contexts. Seeing it out in the open like that could feel awkward for some people.\n\nAlcohol probably has more immediate negative effects on motor skills, but for a lot of people, marijuana has a bigger impact on their lifestyle overall. Both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle moderation, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize because people react so differently to substances.",
            "I'd say, yeah, there are good and bad things about being Catholic.  They've got a lot of traditions they've stuck with for ages, and that can be nice.  It's comforting to have those roots. But, sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't adapt well to change.  Like, a lot of Catholics feel they *have* to go to church every week, and there are strict rules about everything. And, honestly, it feels like they judge people pretty harshly if they don't follow the rules perfectly. \n\nThey don't seem very accepting of people who aren't exactly like them, either.  For example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Isn't that supposed to be a loving religion?  It seems hypocritical to preach love but then turn around and reject people because they don't fit in.\n\nIt's like, they tell you to love everyone, but their actions don't always match those words.  They cling to old rules even though they don't seem to make sense in the modern world.\n\nNow, about priests getting married... I think it'd be good if they could.  But, I don't know if it would really stop the bad stuff that happens sometimes.  Those issues are way more complicated than just whether or not a priest is married. It's a sad thing that happens, and I don't think marriage would magically fix it.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this whole marriage equality issue. I honestly can't say if one side is right or wrong because it's such a complex problem. It's a real tightrope walk between separating church and state and figuring out what marriage truly means. \n\nIt's tough because defining marriage without upsetting anyone is nearly impossible. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining marriage at all, especially when it's seen as a religious sacrament.  Think about it – the government doesn't get involved in how people practice their religion, so why should they dictate who can get married? \n\nMaybe it's simpler to just see it as civil unions.  It's about two people committing to each other, regardless of their beliefs or sexual orientation. The government shouldn't care about the specifics of the ceremony, just that two people want to be together. \n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for a federal law. But, changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That just seems extreme. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for something like this, even if it's important to some people. It's not a big enough issue to warrant such a drastic change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I have lots of gay friends, so it's not a black-and-white issue. While I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a nationwide debate, though.  \n\nI think each state should decide for itself whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage.  Some states lean Democratic, and those are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that's okay with it, you're probably going to be fine with their decision. And honestly, if you choose to live somewhere, you kind of accept their views, right?\n\nI think everyone deserves equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. So, I feel strongly that the legality of gay marriage should be left up to the states.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush should have the power to ban gay marriage nationwide. It should be up to the individual states to decide what's best for them. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be making that kind of decision for everyone.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon.  If a Democratic president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth.  It's better to let each state make its own choice. After all, they're the ones who'll have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they're coming from. I mean, Myspace is basically like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see.  It doesn't matter if you're using your school's name or not, anyone can find it, even from their own homes.  \n\nI think the school officials were right to look at it. If it helps prevent something terrible like a school shooting, that's important. Protecting the students is the school's job, and if they had information about a potential threat, they had a responsibility to act.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a legitimate reason, like preventing harm, then I think it's okay.\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to say something bad about someone in an email because you never know who might read it.  Everything you put online can come back to haunt you later.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.  It's good to be able to express yourself online, but you have to be careful what you say. It's a public space, and anything you post can be seen by anyone, even the school.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was totally on board. Nine/Eleven hit me personally, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we were all just so emotional after that, we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and honestly, I think it backfired.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It feels like the people over there are so caught up in fighting each other that they'll always be at each other's throats, regardless of us being there.  \n\nIt's hard, because of Nine/Eleven, I've kind of just checked out. I don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like, they can't even get along with each other, how are they going to get better?  Sometimes I don't even think they're human, the way they fight.\n\nWe went in blind. We had no idea what we were facing. Their idea of war is so different from ours, they're just savage. I don't think they want to improve their country, they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave it alone. \n\nI think we were mostly just angry and fueled by revenge. We didn't think about the long-term consequences or how they'd react. President Bush, he probably felt pressured, like we had no choice but to declare war on Iraq after what happened.\n\nBut honestly, we should have had a better plan. We were all over the place, with no clear goals or unity. Maybe if we'd gone in with a clear strategy, things would have been different. I just feel like we were all so emotionally driven, and that's what we ended up creating over there. \n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're probably always going to be like this. I just don't know what else to say. This whole thing has dragged on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  \n\nI think no matter how long we stay, things will fall apart as soon as we leave. We can't be there forever, and I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to update some of its views. I've heard they're losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but their stance feels a bit outdated. If they were more open to modern thinking, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing people.  \n\nI've heard people are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these topics.  It's understandable that someone who supports abortion or gay marriage wouldn't feel comfortable in a community that condemns those things.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they couldn't have female priests or allow priests to get married. It seems unfair that they're expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else has a family life outside of work.",
            "Okay, so, I'm not against gay marriage. I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, sexuality isn't something you choose. So, I don't think we should blame people for how they are attracted to others. You know, it seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too hard, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right. It just doesn't seem like a choice, like how some people are born straight and others gay.  It's just how they are.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not really a legal or moral issue. It's just about people being who they are. It's not like they're making a bad choice or something.\n\nIt just feels wrong to make them feel like they're doing something wrong. They shouldn't be treated differently just because of who they love.  It's not like it affects anyone else's safety or anything. It's just their personal lives.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to legalize it. Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but I think it's totally different. It's like two sides of the same coin – they're not the same, but they're connected. \n\nThere are also tons of civil rights issues tied to it. For example, if you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner might not be allowed to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital. It just doesn't seem right if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nPlus, lots of studies show that gay relationships are just as successful as straight relationships. They have the same ingredients for a happy partnership.\n\nReally, it's about marriage certificates and legal rights, not church weddings. If the government keeps religion out of it, there shouldn't be a problem.\n\nIt's kind of like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about things like adoption and how a gay couple living in their community will affect everyone. They also wonder how children of gay couples will adjust.\n\nBut honestly, it's mostly new territory. Parenting skills are the same for everyone, whether they're gay or straight.\n\nI think the federal government should get involved and make same-sex marriage legal in all states.  President Bush seems to have really strong religious views against it, which might be linked to his stance on abortion and stem cell research.  \n\nBut I think it's important to remember that morality is different for everyone.  Just because some religious groups oppose gay marriage doesn't mean the government should enforce their beliefs on everyone. \n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological problem caused by childhood trauma or a personality flaw. But the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. \n\nWe should listen to experts and research instead of just believing what's popular or what our friends tell us.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've learned a thing or two.  Just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take drugs, for instance.  I mean, making them available to the public?  Absolutely not.  But using them for medical reasons?  Definitely yes.  It's all about the context.  \n\nThink about it: there are tons of legal drugs, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, that pharmacies use all the time. They're controlled substances, but they're super helpful.  If we're okay with those, why not consider marijuana for its potential benefits?\n\nIt's not exactly like alcohol, though. Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and so can marijuana. But I think we should approach marijuana differently.  Maybe a gradual legalization process would be better, step by step, so it doesn't get out of hand.  We need to ditch the stigma surrounding marijuana first.  Once people see it's not the scary monster everyone thinks it is, they might use it responsibly.\n\nHonestly, people have such a warped view of marijuana just because it's illegal. It's not like heroin or cocaine, you know?  If we get rid of that image, people could use it responsibly. And definitely for medical purposes!",
            "I think the church has modernized to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday in cute dresses, matching shoes and a purse.  I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long.  People dress much more casually, especially in the summer, coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more relaxed. That's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped these situations. Some married men become pedophiles too. It's a personal issue, not a matter of being able to marry or not. Priests choose to become priests, and if they want to be married while practicing their faith, maybe they should consider another religion. There are religions where priests can marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  \n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. It's something people are born with, not something they choose. Marriage wouldn't change that.  If the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's terrible. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were going with the whole Iraq thing at first, but it was right after 9/11, and everyone was super shook up.  I think they used 9/11 as a way to justify going into Iraq, saying that Saddam Hussein had ties to Osama Bin Laden and weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, none of that was true, and that really rubs me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nHonestly, it feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people about everything. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has said he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a huge betrayal of trust, something that should be impeachable.  It feels like they've just been disrespecting the Constitution ever since 9/11.  \n\nI have a feeling they went into office wanting to go to war.  I remember reading a book by the Treasury Secretary, who basically said that Bush Jr. had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's dealings with him. And on top of that, I think Bush Jr. was hoping to secure more energy resources for the U.S. through the war.  It all feels very manipulative.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough.  Pulling out right now would probably cause a civil war and more deaths, though.  They're trying this thing with a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's going to create problems with Iraq's sovereignty in the long run.\n\nWith the news I've seen, the Parliament doesn't seem to be doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any control.  Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has a bunch of seats in Parliament. There are still so many radical groups fighting for power, and it's creating a lot of tension.",
            "Ugh, the War in Iraq... it's a mess. I mean, it's not even officially a war, which is kinda weird. It feels like it was all about revenge for 9/11, like we just wanted to hit back at whoever we thought did it.  I don't really follow the details, but it seems like we're just stuck there now, trying to build a democracy and get our hands on some oil. But honestly, it's just making everyone angry.  \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is taking forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad because they feel like we messed everything up. It's a lose-lose situation.  \n\nI don't know, it's a hard topic. It feels like we're using our military power to show off, like we're bigger and better. But it doesn't feel right.  We didn't even officially declare war, and now it's dragging on and on. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation where everything feels pointless.\n\nPlus, there are so many families with loved ones over there. I want them to come home safe, but it also feels wrong to stay and change their culture. It's a whole mess. I think this thing is going to keep going for years and years.",
            "Listen, I really don't think it's right for the government to make laws about this.  The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices goes against that.  It feels like picking sides, favoring one church's beliefs over another.  For example, most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in some areas like Boston.  I just don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of what allows for religious freedom in the US. Even though there's talk about making an amendment, I think that's completely wrong.  It would go against what's already in the Constitution and would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, should get involved. It seems like this push for an amendment is just based on personal beliefs, specifically the president's Catholic views. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all others.  This decision should be left up to the churches themselves.  There's no real reason for a government amendment beyond personal opinions. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else, and it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the Iraq War...  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading Iraq, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11 and used that outrage to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq War feels a lot like a repeat of Vietnam. We should have learned from our past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible.  \n\nThe US removed Iraq's government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. They were trying to install a democracy, similar to what happened in Vietnam, where we tried to push out communists and promote democracy. But the US government should have known that wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and there's no guarantee of a clear victory.\n\nIn both Vietnam and Iraq, there were always going to be insurgents, even if some people supported the US intervention. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for any of this. They should have planned for all possible outcomes before going to war.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, but it's a slow process.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war would be quick and successful, but it's far from it.  It takes time to build a new government and a stable society, as we saw in our own country's history.\n\nSo, the war in Iraq is a tough situation. We've been there for so long, it's hard to just walk away. But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice? \n\nIt also makes you wonder why we're only focused on Iraq. Why not other countries with problems, like North Korea? I think the oil issue plays a big part. We need to ask ourselves if this is really about freedom and democracy, or if it's about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. Yet, we aren't doing anything about North Korea, which we know has these weapons.  \n\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure that's going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I just think it's a personal preference, something that's becoming more and more clear is biological, not sociological. It doesn't make sense to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong to me. I've always supported gay marriage. \n\nAnd honestly, politics and government shouldn't be involved. It's not a state or national issue; it's about personal relationships and families. Like, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though — walk their dogs, hang out, you know?  It's frustrating that Bush is trying to define marriage in his own way. It just seems ridiculous.\n\nThere's so much research now showing that being gay might be biological, a chemical thing in the brain, not something you choose. It's like being predisposed to something, not a result of your upbringing.\n\nBesides the obvious, it feels like marriage is different for gay couples.  A straight couple can just elope to Vegas if they want, but a gay couple wanting to get married makes headlines.  It shouldn't be such a big deal. It's a private matter, not something that needs to be public.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal: anything you post online becomes public knowledge.  It's out there for everyone to see. As an RA, I've had to deal with this firsthand.  Whatever you put on the internet  shapes how people perceive you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that kind of stuff out into the world. The internet is global; if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nThe school didn't magically receive a bulletin; someone went to them with this information. They have to act on these kinds of threats because, imagine if something happened, and they could have prevented it. \n\nBut it's a tricky situation because you don't always know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a harmless joke gone wrong, like a sociology class experiment, or it could be something truly dangerous.  \n\nIn our school's case, someone overheard a conversation, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked at the student's Facebook page because some things he posted, while maybe intended as a joke, became very concerning in light of the situation.\n\nThe bottom line is, when you share things online, there's no real expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret things or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles.  It's a violation of privacy.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on way too long. At the beginning, the intention seemed good – to bring democracy to a country lacking fair political systems. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now it feels like we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. \n\nHonestly, I have doubts about the initial motives too. There were those past conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein that might have played a role.\n\nIf the goal was to help a country oppressed by a dictator achieve democracy, that would be a justifiable reason. But if personal vendettas were involved, that wouldn't be right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on far too long. We made our point in the initial months, demonstrating our military strength. But years later, it just feels excessive.\n\nI believe our original purpose has become muddled and distorted. It seems like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a decisive victory, instead of for a clear, achievable goal.\n\nIt's time to end this war. Their government and officials need to take responsibility for their own country. We've already drained our economy, spending billions on a conflict that's lost its meaning.\n\nWe have pressing issues at home – poverty, inadequate infrastructure, healthcare – that deserve our attention and funding. Spending billions on a prolonged war that has lost its purpose is draining our resources from these critical areas. \n\nWe need to stop this war and invest in our own people and our own future.",
            "Can I ask something to make sure I understand? It sounds like this situation was stopped because someone saw something online, right?\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nHonestly, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.  On sites like Myspace, if you put information out there, it's basically public knowledge. I get that on Myspace you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you accept someone as a friend, you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nSo, if you post something online, you should know that lots of people might see it. If I think that in this case, someone seeing that information online and preventing a tragedy was a good thing.\n\nThat's a tough one though.  I mean, you can't have one person constantly checking everyone's profiles at school to prevent something bad from happening. But then, if they start focusing on \"bad kids\" and looking at their profiles, that feels like discrimination.\n\nI don't think it would be fair to have someone's job be to monitor people's profiles all day.  But maybe it depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence of something specific, or were they just randomly browsing? It's hard to say.\n\n\nI don't personally have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw a news story once about a guy who could easily find people's information online. He got a girl's screen name from her profile and started talking to her on instant messenger. He managed to get her to meet him in less than a minute. \n\nPersonally, I would never do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their screen names. They know it's me, though. It's strange because they seem to know a lot about me - my interests, what I look like, even my class schedule and who my friends are. They can see all sorts of photos too. I try to be careful about what I post, but at the same time, Facebook is supposed to be a way to connect with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me. I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how the school has the right to tell students they can't use Myspace.",
            "Hmm, you know, talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical. I hate to jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start, but I was.  It's not really a big deal anymore though, because everyone pretty much agrees it was a bad idea except for those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nLook at the polls - they've done them everywhere, in the US, Iraq, even globally, and  it's pretty clear: 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad call. Eighty percent of Iraqis feel the same way, and even 70% of US troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from day one.  It was a disaster before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another disaster.  \n\nThere's just no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. It's a clash of cultures - the US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and previous ones, think they can just force democracy on a region where it doesn't fit. It's just not how those people want to live.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a complete disaster.  It's like quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons. \n\nIf they want to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that. But I just don't see why we shouldn't leave now. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better.\n\nAt least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say, \"We were going to stay, but you guys made the decision to leave.\"\n\nMaybe that would make us the \"good guys\" - not really, no, never truly. But it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. \n\nAnd it's not just about women. I think it depends on the specific field you're in. \n\nFor women, overall, I feel like they face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to exist, a lot of people still struggle to accept having a woman in a leadership position, especially if it's over a man. This is because of how society has been for so long.\n\nWomen often hit a point where they're qualified for a promotion, but the board might not choose them because of the historical stereotype that women aren't usually in leadership roles. \n\nIt's similar for men too, though. Think about things like the fashion industry or staying at home as a parent. \n\nIt's uncommon for a man to stay at home while the woman works. People sometimes judge that because society expects men to be the primary earners. But maybe the husband wants to be with the kids, and the wife has the better job. It can be really hard for them because society doesn't see it as the \"normal\" arrangement.\n\nAnd in fashion, straight men can sometimes struggle to be taken seriously.  It might sound weird, but it's probably because people associate fashion with women. If a man has a \"typical\" lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might wonder if he really understands women's fashion. \n\nBasically, I think gender discrimination exists in different ways depending on your field.\n\nChanging it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change takes time.  \n\nThe good news is, we're seeing progress. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in the business world. We're also seeing more stay-at-home dads being accepted because people are realizing that sometimes it works better that way. \n\nIt's all about showing the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. If you force things, people resist. \n\nWe're at a good point now where things are slowly changing, but it takes time.",
            "They didn't actually legalize marijuana; they decriminalized it.  That means it's not a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited instead of arrested and booked.  I think that if someone gets caught with it and gets cited, it can still have consequences for things like job interviews. Those kinds of negative impacts are usually the worst part of having a drug charge.  Even with decriminalization, people worry about those future repercussions.  \n\nBut on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest, book, and house people, plus court costs, public defenders, and the state attorney’s office. All that adds up. So when cities are struggling financially, some aren't willing to make that change, even if it would free up money for things like public education, social programs, and food assistance. Some communities just strongly oppose marijuana and don't want to decriminalize it.  \n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, might be fine with it because it frees up resources. I think it's important because marijuana shouldn't just be readily available everywhere. There are lots of reasons for that, but the financial aspect is a big one too.\n\nIf it were fully legalized, it could be like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked openly. That might lead to more people smoking and driving. Plus, marijuana is still seen as taboo in many places and contexts. Seeing it out in the open like that could feel awkward for some people.\n\nAlcohol probably has more immediate negative effects on motor skills, but for a lot of people, marijuana has a bigger impact on their lifestyle overall. Both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle moderation, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize because people react so differently to substances.",
            "I'd say, yeah, there are good and bad things about being Catholic.  They've got a lot of traditions they've stuck with for ages, and that can be nice.  It's comforting to have those roots. But, sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't adapt well to change.  Like, a lot of Catholics feel they *have* to go to church every week, and there are strict rules about everything. And, honestly, it feels like they judge people pretty harshly if they don't follow the rules perfectly. \n\nThey don't seem very accepting of people who aren't exactly like them, either.  For example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Isn't that supposed to be a loving religion?  It seems hypocritical to preach love but then turn around and reject people because they don't fit in.\n\nIt's like, they tell you to love everyone, but their actions don't always match those words.  They cling to old rules even though they don't seem to make sense in the modern world.\n\nNow, about priests getting married... I think it'd be good if they could.  But, I don't know if it would really stop the bad stuff that happens sometimes.  Those issues are way more complicated than just whether or not a priest is married. It's a sad thing that happens, and I don't think marriage would magically fix it.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this whole marriage equality issue. I honestly can't say if one side is right or wrong because it's such a complex problem. It's a real tightrope walk between separating church and state and figuring out what marriage truly means. \n\nIt's tough because defining marriage without upsetting anyone is nearly impossible. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining marriage at all, especially when it's seen as a religious sacrament.  Think about it – the government doesn't get involved in how people practice their religion, so why should they dictate who can get married? \n\nMaybe it's simpler to just see it as civil unions.  It's about two people committing to each other, regardless of their beliefs or sexual orientation. The government shouldn't care about the specifics of the ceremony, just that two people want to be together. \n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for a federal law. But, changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That just seems extreme. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for something like this, even if it's important to some people. It's not a big enough issue to warrant such a drastic change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I have lots of gay friends, so it's not a black-and-white issue. While I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a nationwide debate, though.  \n\nI think each state should decide for itself whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage.  Some states lean Democratic, and those are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that's okay with it, you're probably going to be fine with their decision. And honestly, if you choose to live somewhere, you kind of accept their views, right?\n\nI think everyone deserves equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. So, I feel strongly that the legality of gay marriage should be left up to the states.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush should have the power to ban gay marriage nationwide. It should be up to the individual states to decide what's best for them. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be making that kind of decision for everyone.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon.  If a Democratic president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth.  It's better to let each state make its own choice. After all, they're the ones who'll have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they're coming from. I mean, Myspace is basically like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see.  It doesn't matter if you're using your school's name or not, anyone can find it, even from their own homes.  \n\nI think the school officials were right to look at it. If it helps prevent something terrible like a school shooting, that's important. Protecting the students is the school's job, and if they had information about a potential threat, they had a responsibility to act.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a legitimate reason, like preventing harm, then I think it's okay.\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to say something bad about someone in an email because you never know who might read it.  Everything you put online can come back to haunt you later.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.  It's good to be able to express yourself online, but you have to be careful what you say. It's a public space, and anything you post can be seen by anyone, even the school.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was totally on board. Nine/Eleven hit me personally, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we were all just so emotional after that, we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and honestly, I think it backfired.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It feels like the people over there are so caught up in fighting each other that they'll always be at each other's throats, regardless of us being there.  \n\nIt's hard, because of Nine/Eleven, I've kind of just checked out. I don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like, they can't even get along with each other, how are they going to get better?  Sometimes I don't even think they're human, the way they fight.\n\nWe went in blind. We had no idea what we were facing. Their idea of war is so different from ours, they're just savage. I don't think they want to improve their country, they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave it alone. \n\nI think we were mostly just angry and fueled by revenge. We didn't think about the long-term consequences or how they'd react. President Bush, he probably felt pressured, like we had no choice but to declare war on Iraq after what happened.\n\nBut honestly, we should have had a better plan. We were all over the place, with no clear goals or unity. Maybe if we'd gone in with a clear strategy, things would have been different. I just feel like we were all so emotionally driven, and that's what we ended up creating over there. \n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're probably always going to be like this. I just don't know what else to say. This whole thing has dragged on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  \n\nI think no matter how long we stay, things will fall apart as soon as we leave. We can't be there forever, and I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. Lately, I've heard they're losing members, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things.  \n\nTake things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these issues, which is fine, but some of those views seem pretty outdated. If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing followers.\n\nPeople are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics.  They see it as a negative thing, like if you believe in abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it.  Same with gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be in a group that opposes it.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a family and a job; why not priests?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage.  I think that whether someone is born that way or not, it's not a choice they make.  So, I feel like gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are attracted to. It doesn't seem fair to me that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  Honestly, I haven't thought about it too much, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\n\nI guess it's like this: I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay.  It doesn't feel like a choice either way. So, why should someone be held accountable for something they can't control? It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this. It's not a legal issue or really even a moral one.  I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal or treated like they made a bad decision.  \n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in this. It doesn't affect national security or morals. It just seems like they're overstepping boundaries.  People should be able to live their lives as they choose, and that includes who they love. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some people worry that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but that just doesn't make sense. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing just because they're both sides of a coin. They're different, but both valid.  \n\nThere are lots of civil rights tied to marriage, too. For example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be able to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's kind of unfair if you're committed to someone for life.\n\nPlus, research shows that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship dynamics as straight couples. It's just a relationship, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat gets people hung up is the idea of churches and religion. But gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're asking for a legal document from the government. If the government doesn't get involved in religious matters, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else. Some people worry about adoption and how it will affect children, but studies haven't shown any negative impacts. The biggest problem kids of same-sex couples face is bullying and prejudice from others.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely make gay marriage legal nationwide. It's a matter of equality and basic human rights. President Bush, however, seems to have strong religious beliefs that influence his stance on gay marriage, which aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. \n\nHis reasoning often comes down to morality, but morality is subjective and varies widely. It's not fair to impose the religious beliefs of one group on the entire country. Plus, it's hypocritical to oppose \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance while supporting laws based on religious beliefs.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or a result of childhood trauma.  But that's simply not true, according to the American Psychological Association. We need to base our views on facts and research, not on prejudice and misinformation.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take marijuana, for example.  I think it should be legal for medicinal purposes because its potential benefits shouldn't be ignored just because of its legal status.  It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nThink about it, pharmacies use lots of controlled substances like oxycontin, Vicodin, and Percocet all the time. They're helpful, right?  But there's this stigma around marijuana that makes people forget it could have similar benefits.\n\nAlcohol is different, though.  Both alcohol and marijuana can be abused, but I think we should focus on removing the taboo around marijuana first.  Maybe then people would use it more responsibly.\n\nHonestly, the way people view marijuana is totally unfair.  It's not nearly as dangerous as other drugs, so if we changed people's perceptions, they might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed and adapted to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be.  When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. That was the norm back then. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there every weekend.\n\nNow, things are different. They have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. You'll see families rushing in from the beach straight to church. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of the formal attire I wore before. It's definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing women priests or permitting priests to marry would have stopped those horrible acts.  There are married men who become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.  \n\nIf someone truly wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion, like some of the ones where ministers or reverends are allowed to marry. \n\nI think pedophilia has roots in genetics. It's something people are born with, not something they become.  You can't hide it through marriage. It might come out eventually. The church may have failed to address the issue properly in some cases, but I don't believe they could have prevented it altogether.",
            "Man, you know, at first I was cool with the idea of the Iraq War, but everyone was still super shook up from 9/11. It felt like we rushed into it, using it as an excuse.  I mean, the Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, and we all know that turned out to be a big fat lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush team straight-up lied to the American people, and they still haven't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that huge speech at the UN, now says he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong, plain and simple. It's like, how can you lie to the country like that? That's gotta be grounds for impeachment! And it's not just that; it feels like the Bush administration has been trying to push the Constitution aside ever since 9/11.\n\nIt seems like they came into office wanting to go to war. I can't remember the name of the Treasury Secretary who said this, but he wrote about it in his book after he got pushed out. It sounds like the younger Bush had some personal beef with Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. It's all pretty sneaky if you ask me.\n\nI think it's gone on long enough, though. If we pulled out right now, things could get really messy and even more people could die. It seems like the UN and the US are trying to get countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help set things right. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause more problems in the long run because it messes with Iraq's sovereignty. \n\nThe government is falling apart. The news says the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in charge. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has seats in Parliament!  We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for control, and it's creating a lot of chaos.",
            "I'm not sure how to put this into words.  It feels like a pointless war, you know? I mean, it wasn't even officially declared. It just feels like we invaded Iraq because we thought they were behind 9/11.  Honestly, I don't really follow the news about it closely. I don't know all the details.\n\nBut, from what I gather, we're still there trying to build democracy and get access to their oil.  The problem is, it's creating a lot of anger. Staying there forever to build a democracy will take ages, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up.\n\nIt's a real dilemma.  It makes me wonder if we should even call it a war anymore. We never actually declared it. It seems like we're just showing off our military power and trying to make ourselves look big.\n\nPart of me feels like we should stay and help them, but it's also costing us so much, and it's making President Bush look bad. I worry he'll become known as the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nThen there are the families with loved ones in Iraq. I hate to say it, but I want the war to end for them, but I also don't want us to just abandon the people of Iraq. They've lost so much.\n\nI feel like if we stay, we'll try to make them more like us, which could backfire. It might make things worse and fuel more hatred towards America. \n\nThis whole situation feels like it's going to drag on forever. Ugh, it's just so complicated.",
            "You know, I don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or for any state to even try to say it's okay.  It just seems like something the churches should decide for themselves. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and it seems to me that trying to control or influence this issue goes against what's already been established.\n\nI think people pushing to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe in some areas like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can or can't do.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution and something that allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even though there have been talks about making an amendment,  I think adding one about this would be completely wrong and go against what's already written. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that's actually used to restrict people instead of the government, which doesn't seem right.\n\nI firmly believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, shouldn't be involved in this. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's based on their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're just trying to favor one religion over all others.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't really a good reason to support this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else in a negative way. In fact, it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I really don't think the government was completely honest with us about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used our fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.  Personally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes.\n\nThis Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and we should have learned from our mistakes there.  A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and just removed the Iraqi government without really thinking about what would happen next. They didn't plan for the chaos, the power vacuum, and all the fallout. The US is trying to install a democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but pushing out Communists and trying to force democracy on a country is never easy. It's a long and difficult process, and we should have known that going in.\n\nIt wasn't a clear-cut victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss, because no matter how many people support you, there will always be insurgents. You can't defeat a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to, we needed to be prepared for everything. We weren't ready for the aftermath, for what would happen once they took out Saddam Hussein.\n\nWe're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a long process.  \n\nThe government kind of misled the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission. But implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history! It took a long struggle to get to the strong democracy we have today.\n\nSo, what do we do now? It's a tough decision. We can't just abandon Iraq now after everything we've done. But how many more lives are we willing to lose for a free and democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be honest, why just Iraq? Why not other countries? I think the oil is a big factor. We need that oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any. But North Korea has those weapons, and we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough.\n\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there, but I'm not very optimistic.",
            "I'm a big supporter of gay marriage, always have been.  It's a personal choice, and research shows it could even be biological rather than social.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control.  I think it's unfair and inhumane.  I've always been an advocate for equal rights for everyone, including gay couples.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal matter, something between two people and their families.  In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and being part of the community.  \n\nIt seems like President Bush is trying to play God by interpreting marriage in his own way. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from lots of sources that being gay might be a biological thing, something you're predisposed to. It's not a choice you make based on your upbringing or environment.  \n\nBesides the obvious, I think it's unfair that a couple can just run off and get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal. It should be a private matter, something between the couple and their family, not something that's splashed all over the news.  It shouldn't be a national issue.",
            "So, basically, when you put something on the internet, it's out there for everyone to see.  It's like a public space. As an RA, I've dealt with this before.  Once you post something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you're talking about causing harm, like explosions or shootings, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their posts.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if it's the school that got the alert, someone saw it and reported it. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just people messing around. Maybe it was a social experiment that went wrong, like for a sociology class. \n\nOr maybe it was something really serious. In this case, something happened at school, someone overheard a conversation, and they reported it. When they looked through the person's Facebook, they found things that were concerning, even if the person meant them as a joke. In the end, the internet doesn't offer much privacy. If you don't want people to see something, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it.\n\nIt's not okay for school officials to be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy because the person shared it with others. If there's a potential danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI think schools should focus on what's brought to their attention directly, not on monitoring phone calls, texts, or IMs.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on far too long. At the start, the goal seemed good—to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power, not for any real reason.  \n\nPlus, I wonder if the motives were ever truly pure. There were definitely connections to personal grudges between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to help establish democracy, that would be a noble cause. But if personal matters were involved, then it's not right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on way too long. We made our point in the beginning, but hanging on for years just isn't necessary. Their government and people need to figure things out on their own.\n\nIt's draining our economy. We're spending billions on a war that seems to have lost its purpose, while neglecting our own problems like poverty, failing infrastructure, and inadequate healthcare. That money could be better used to help our own citizens.  \n\nIt's just not right to keep pouring resources into a war that seems endless. We need to bring our troops home and focus on solving the issues we have right here at home.",
            "So, someone was asking if it was okay for someone to look at people's Myspace profiles to prevent something bad from happening.  I think it's pretty much fair game if you post something online, especially on a site like Myspace where you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. If you're friends with someone, you're giving them permission to see what you post.  \n\nIt's tough though, because you can't have someone constantly checking everyone's profiles. It would be like singling out certain kids as \"bad\" and targeting them. It's a tricky situation. Maybe it depends on the situation. If someone sees something specific that raises a red flag, then it might be justified. \n\nI personally have a Facebook, and it's unsettling knowing that anyone could see my information. I once saw a news story about a guy who easily found someone's information from their profile and started chatting with them. It's scary how much information is out there.  \n\nI try to be careful about what I share online, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a balancing act. \n\nI also heard that some high schools actually banned Myspace.  It seems strange to me that schools would have that kind of control over what their students do online.  It feels like a privacy issue.",
            "I feel awkward talking about the Iraq War, you know? It's hard not to feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon of people who were against it from the start.  But honestly, looking back, it's clear to me that it was a mistake.  Everyone seems to agree, except maybe for the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  There have been polls everywhere – in the U.S., Iraq, and globally – showing that 75 to 80% of people think the war was a bad idea.  Even a lot of the U.S. troops stationed there believe we should get out within the next year.\n\nIt feels like everything about the war has been a disaster, even before we even went in.  Pulling out is going to be a mess too, and there's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's a clash of cultures, and it seems like our government just doesn't understand that. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly.  You have to weigh the pros and cons carefully, and in this case, the cons far outweigh the pros.  It's like quicksand – once we went in, we got stuck.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason for us to stay there. The administration probably has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, and maybe there are some risks involved in leaving. But I haven't heard any convincing reasons why we shouldn't just go.\n\nIf they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have much of a problem with that. But the longer we stay, the worse it seems to get. I read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a lot of them want us to leave right now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nIf we ask them what they want, and they say they want us to leave, then at least we can say we gave them a choice. If things go bad after that, we can say we tried to do what was best, but they ultimately made the decision.  Maybe then we could at least be seen as the good guys, or at least less bad.",
            "Yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S. It's not just about women though. It's more about the specific field you're working in.  I mean, overall, women face tougher times because of that invisible \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is the goal, many people struggle to work for a woman in a leadership position, just because of how society's always been. So, often, women see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because traditionally, women haven't held top positions in business. And, I guess the same goes for men too.  \n\nThink about things like being a stay-at-home parent. It's super uncommon for a man to stay home while his wife works. People often judge them, assuming the man should be the breadwinner. It can be tough for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be at home with their kids, even if their wife has the higher-paying job.  But society doesn't get it.\n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Men who are into fashion, especially straight men, sometimes don't get taken seriously. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because people think guys who are into fashion have different lifestyles. So, if a guy fits the typical mold and he's in fashion, people might wonder, \"How can he really understand fashion if he's not more like us, the women?\"\n\nIt's like, depending on your field, there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, even though we've come a long way since the 1800s. Change is slow, but women are rising in business, becoming CEOs and getting more acceptance.  It's happening, and people are starting to get on board.\n\nThe same goes for stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the wife is the better earner, or maybe she just wants to work. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their wives or female friends and understanding where men are coming from.\n\nSo, we have to promote these stereotypes by showing off the good qualities of those who are usually looked down on, but not in a pushy way. You can't force change, or people will resist. We're in a good spot where things are starting to change naturally.  \n\nI don't think there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time, and we've already come a long way.  \n\nOh, and I think people discriminate against each other based on where they're from too. If a guy grew up on a farm and his grammar isn't perfect, but he's super smart and becomes a CEO, some men might make fun of him, saying things like, \"How can I trust you if you don't even speak correctly?\" You know?",
            "So, they didn't exactly make marijuana legal, they decriminalized it.  \n\nThink of it like this: instead of being a criminal offense, it's now more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited, but you don't get arrested, booked, or hauled into jail. \n\nThere are still some downsides though.  Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews might still be affected.  Those big, scary consequences of a drug charge, they don't always disappear.\n\nBut, on the other hand, getting caught with marijuana used to cost taxpayers a ton of money.  Think about it: arresting people, holding them in jail, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all adds up. \n\nPlaces that are struggling financially might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it saved them money. \n\nSome places, like Denver, are more open to the idea.  They might even use the money saved to fund things like education, social programs, and food assistance.  \n\nIt's important to remember that just because something is decriminalized doesn't mean it should be everywhere.  We need to be careful about how it's handled.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could end up like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it might just feel uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nI think alcohol actually has a bigger impact on your ability to drive safely, but marijuana can be more disruptive to someone's everyday life.  \n\nUltimately, every substance affects people differently.  Some people can handle it better than others.  It's tough to generalize.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do is pretty traditional. They've done things the same way for ages, and it's good to have those roots. But it's also important to be able to change with the times, you know?  \n\nA lot of Catholics think they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow every single rule perfectly.  They don't really accept people who aren't exactly \"ideal\" Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions either.  Like, for example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nIt doesn't seem very tolerant of other faiths to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic thing, but it feels hypocritical to say you love others and then not accept them the way they are.  So, a lot of Catholic teachings are about doing things a certain way, but then the way they actually practice goes against it because it's so stuck in the past.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests from abusing children. It's a whole different issue.  It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\n\nI mean, people who hurt children probably would do it whether or not they were married. It's about a power imbalance, not about being married or not. If someone is going to abuse a child, they're going to do it whether they have a spouse or not. I don't think letting priests get married would stop that from happening.",
            "I'm still figuring out my stance on this whole marriage equality debate. It's really tough, you know? It feels like it walks a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means.  It's hard not to offend anyone when you're trying to define something so personal. \n\nI'm leaning towards the idea that all unions, whether they're between two men, two women, or a man and a woman, should be treated as civil unions.  After all, the government doesn't get involved in religious ceremonies like baptism, right?  Why should marriage be any different?  It's about two people coming together, and that's what matters.\n\nI think it's important for the government to stay out of people's personal lives and not dictate who they can marry.  If all the states can agree on a reasonable solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law.  \n\nBut a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That seems extreme.  Changing the constitution shouldn't be taken lightly, especially for something like this. It's a big deal for some people, but I don't think it's important enough to warrant amending the constitution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe they should have the right to marry. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each individual state.\n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, while others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and people living there should be able to live in accordance with their state's values. If you choose to live in a state that legalizes it, you're essentially accepting that decision.\n\nBasically, I think everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities. So, I believe in leaving the decision of whether or not to legalize gay marriage up to each state. \n\nI don't think President Bush should have the power to ban it nationwide.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should govern itself. Plus, with a new president potentially coming in soon, it's likely to become a back-and-forth issue. It's best to let individual states make their own choices, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences.",
            "Look, I get it. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Whatever you post, anyone can see it. So if you're putting something on there, you kind of have to assume people are going to see it, even people like school officials. I mean, even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut when it comes to preventing something terrible like a school shooting, I think the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe. If they see something online that makes them think a student might be a danger, I think it's okay for them to look into it. \n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if it's about protecting kids, I think it's fine. \n\nThink about it: you wouldn't want to send your kid to a school where the staff wasn't doing everything they could to keep them safe, right? \n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to put anything nasty about someone in an email because you never know who might see it later.  Everything online can come back to bite you. \n\nSo, yeah, I think the school officials were justified in looking at the Myspace page. They were just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... at first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted revenge, you know? But looking back, I think we went in too emotionally.  We didn't really plan things out, and now I think it backfired.\n\nI don't think being there is helping. It seems like they're just fighting amongst themselves anyway, and we're caught in the middle.  Honestly, because of 9/11, I've kind of checked out. I don't care what happens over there anymore.\n\nIt's frustrating. They're so different from us when it comes to war. It's savage. They don't want to make their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were more angry than anything when we went in.  We wanted revenge, and I think President Bush let that dictate his actions.  But I get it, we couldn't just ignore what happened.\n\nI just wish we had a better plan. We didn't know what we were walking into, and I don't think we had a clear goal. There wasn't any unity. \n\nWe made some progress, but it's not enough.  We can't stay forever, and I honestly think things will just fall apart once we leave. We're hurting ourselves by staying there."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. Lately, I've heard they're losing members, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things.  \n\nTake things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these issues, which is fine, but some of those views seem pretty outdated. If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing followers.\n\nPeople are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics.  They see it as a negative thing, like if you believe in abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it.  Same with gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be in a group that opposes it.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a family and a job; why not priests?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage.  I think that whether someone is born that way or not, it's not a choice they make.  So, I feel like gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are attracted to. It doesn't seem fair to me that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  Honestly, I haven't thought about it too much, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\n\nI guess it's like this: I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay.  It doesn't feel like a choice either way. So, why should someone be held accountable for something they can't control? It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this. It's not a legal issue or really even a moral one.  I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal or treated like they made a bad decision.  \n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in this. It doesn't affect national security or morals. It just seems like they're overstepping boundaries.  People should be able to live their lives as they choose, and that includes who they love. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some people worry that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but that just doesn't make sense. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing just because they're both sides of a coin. They're different, but both valid.  \n\nThere are lots of civil rights tied to marriage, too. For example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be able to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's kind of unfair if you're committed to someone for life.\n\nPlus, research shows that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship dynamics as straight couples. It's just a relationship, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat gets people hung up is the idea of churches and religion. But gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're asking for a legal document from the government. If the government doesn't get involved in religious matters, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else. Some people worry about adoption and how it will affect children, but studies haven't shown any negative impacts. The biggest problem kids of same-sex couples face is bullying and prejudice from others.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely make gay marriage legal nationwide. It's a matter of equality and basic human rights. President Bush, however, seems to have strong religious beliefs that influence his stance on gay marriage, which aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. \n\nHis reasoning often comes down to morality, but morality is subjective and varies widely. It's not fair to impose the religious beliefs of one group on the entire country. Plus, it's hypocritical to oppose \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance while supporting laws based on religious beliefs.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or a result of childhood trauma.  But that's simply not true, according to the American Psychological Association. We need to base our views on facts and research, not on prejudice and misinformation.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take marijuana, for example.  I think it should be legal for medicinal purposes because its potential benefits shouldn't be ignored just because of its legal status.  It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nThink about it, pharmacies use lots of controlled substances like oxycontin, Vicodin, and Percocet all the time. They're helpful, right?  But there's this stigma around marijuana that makes people forget it could have similar benefits.\n\nAlcohol is different, though.  Both alcohol and marijuana can be abused, but I think we should focus on removing the taboo around marijuana first.  Maybe then people would use it more responsibly.\n\nHonestly, the way people view marijuana is totally unfair.  It's not nearly as dangerous as other drugs, so if we changed people's perceptions, they might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed and adapted to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be.  When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. That was the norm back then. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there every weekend.\n\nNow, things are different. They have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. You'll see families rushing in from the beach straight to church. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of the formal attire I wore before. It's definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing women priests or permitting priests to marry would have stopped those horrible acts.  There are married men who become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.  \n\nIf someone truly wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion, like some of the ones where ministers or reverends are allowed to marry. \n\nI think pedophilia has roots in genetics. It's something people are born with, not something they become.  You can't hide it through marriage. It might come out eventually. The church may have failed to address the issue properly in some cases, but I don't believe they could have prevented it altogether.",
            "Man, you know, at first I was cool with the idea of the Iraq War, but everyone was still super shook up from 9/11. It felt like we rushed into it, using it as an excuse.  I mean, the Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, and we all know that turned out to be a big fat lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush team straight-up lied to the American people, and they still haven't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that huge speech at the UN, now says he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong, plain and simple. It's like, how can you lie to the country like that? That's gotta be grounds for impeachment! And it's not just that; it feels like the Bush administration has been trying to push the Constitution aside ever since 9/11.\n\nIt seems like they came into office wanting to go to war. I can't remember the name of the Treasury Secretary who said this, but he wrote about it in his book after he got pushed out. It sounds like the younger Bush had some personal beef with Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. It's all pretty sneaky if you ask me.\n\nI think it's gone on long enough, though. If we pulled out right now, things could get really messy and even more people could die. It seems like the UN and the US are trying to get countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help set things right. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause more problems in the long run because it messes with Iraq's sovereignty. \n\nThe government is falling apart. The news says the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in charge. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has seats in Parliament!  We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for control, and it's creating a lot of chaos.",
            "I'm not sure how to put this into words.  It feels like a pointless war, you know? I mean, it wasn't even officially declared. It just feels like we invaded Iraq because we thought they were behind 9/11.  Honestly, I don't really follow the news about it closely. I don't know all the details.\n\nBut, from what I gather, we're still there trying to build democracy and get access to their oil.  The problem is, it's creating a lot of anger. Staying there forever to build a democracy will take ages, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up.\n\nIt's a real dilemma.  It makes me wonder if we should even call it a war anymore. We never actually declared it. It seems like we're just showing off our military power and trying to make ourselves look big.\n\nPart of me feels like we should stay and help them, but it's also costing us so much, and it's making President Bush look bad. I worry he'll become known as the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nThen there are the families with loved ones in Iraq. I hate to say it, but I want the war to end for them, but I also don't want us to just abandon the people of Iraq. They've lost so much.\n\nI feel like if we stay, we'll try to make them more like us, which could backfire. It might make things worse and fuel more hatred towards America. \n\nThis whole situation feels like it's going to drag on forever. Ugh, it's just so complicated.",
            "You know, I don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or for any state to even try to say it's okay.  It just seems like something the churches should decide for themselves. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and it seems to me that trying to control or influence this issue goes against what's already been established.\n\nI think people pushing to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe in some areas like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can or can't do.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution and something that allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even though there have been talks about making an amendment,  I think adding one about this would be completely wrong and go against what's already written. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that's actually used to restrict people instead of the government, which doesn't seem right.\n\nI firmly believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, shouldn't be involved in this. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's based on their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're just trying to favor one religion over all others.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't really a good reason to support this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else in a negative way. In fact, it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I really don't think the government was completely honest with us about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used our fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.  Personally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes.\n\nThis Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and we should have learned from our mistakes there.  A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and just removed the Iraqi government without really thinking about what would happen next. They didn't plan for the chaos, the power vacuum, and all the fallout. The US is trying to install a democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but pushing out Communists and trying to force democracy on a country is never easy. It's a long and difficult process, and we should have known that going in.\n\nIt wasn't a clear-cut victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss, because no matter how many people support you, there will always be insurgents. You can't defeat a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to, we needed to be prepared for everything. We weren't ready for the aftermath, for what would happen once they took out Saddam Hussein.\n\nWe're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a long process.  \n\nThe government kind of misled the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission. But implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history! It took a long struggle to get to the strong democracy we have today.\n\nSo, what do we do now? It's a tough decision. We can't just abandon Iraq now after everything we've done. But how many more lives are we willing to lose for a free and democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be honest, why just Iraq? Why not other countries? I think the oil is a big factor. We need that oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any. But North Korea has those weapons, and we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough.\n\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there, but I'm not very optimistic.",
            "I'm a big supporter of gay marriage, always have been.  It's a personal choice, and research shows it could even be biological rather than social.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control.  I think it's unfair and inhumane.  I've always been an advocate for equal rights for everyone, including gay couples.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal matter, something between two people and their families.  In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and being part of the community.  \n\nIt seems like President Bush is trying to play God by interpreting marriage in his own way. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from lots of sources that being gay might be a biological thing, something you're predisposed to. It's not a choice you make based on your upbringing or environment.  \n\nBesides the obvious, I think it's unfair that a couple can just run off and get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal. It should be a private matter, something between the couple and their family, not something that's splashed all over the news.  It shouldn't be a national issue.",
            "So, basically, when you put something on the internet, it's out there for everyone to see.  It's like a public space. As an RA, I've dealt with this before.  Once you post something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you're talking about causing harm, like explosions or shootings, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their posts.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if it's the school that got the alert, someone saw it and reported it. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just people messing around. Maybe it was a social experiment that went wrong, like for a sociology class. \n\nOr maybe it was something really serious. In this case, something happened at school, someone overheard a conversation, and they reported it. When they looked through the person's Facebook, they found things that were concerning, even if the person meant them as a joke. In the end, the internet doesn't offer much privacy. If you don't want people to see something, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it.\n\nIt's not okay for school officials to be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy because the person shared it with others. If there's a potential danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI think schools should focus on what's brought to their attention directly, not on monitoring phone calls, texts, or IMs.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on far too long. At the start, the goal seemed good—to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power, not for any real reason.  \n\nPlus, I wonder if the motives were ever truly pure. There were definitely connections to personal grudges between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to help establish democracy, that would be a noble cause. But if personal matters were involved, then it's not right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on way too long. We made our point in the beginning, but hanging on for years just isn't necessary. Their government and people need to figure things out on their own.\n\nIt's draining our economy. We're spending billions on a war that seems to have lost its purpose, while neglecting our own problems like poverty, failing infrastructure, and inadequate healthcare. That money could be better used to help our own citizens.  \n\nIt's just not right to keep pouring resources into a war that seems endless. We need to bring our troops home and focus on solving the issues we have right here at home.",
            "So, someone was asking if it was okay for someone to look at people's Myspace profiles to prevent something bad from happening.  I think it's pretty much fair game if you post something online, especially on a site like Myspace where you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. If you're friends with someone, you're giving them permission to see what you post.  \n\nIt's tough though, because you can't have someone constantly checking everyone's profiles. It would be like singling out certain kids as \"bad\" and targeting them. It's a tricky situation. Maybe it depends on the situation. If someone sees something specific that raises a red flag, then it might be justified. \n\nI personally have a Facebook, and it's unsettling knowing that anyone could see my information. I once saw a news story about a guy who easily found someone's information from their profile and started chatting with them. It's scary how much information is out there.  \n\nI try to be careful about what I share online, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a balancing act. \n\nI also heard that some high schools actually banned Myspace.  It seems strange to me that schools would have that kind of control over what their students do online.  It feels like a privacy issue.",
            "I feel awkward talking about the Iraq War, you know? It's hard not to feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon of people who were against it from the start.  But honestly, looking back, it's clear to me that it was a mistake.  Everyone seems to agree, except maybe for the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  There have been polls everywhere – in the U.S., Iraq, and globally – showing that 75 to 80% of people think the war was a bad idea.  Even a lot of the U.S. troops stationed there believe we should get out within the next year.\n\nIt feels like everything about the war has been a disaster, even before we even went in.  Pulling out is going to be a mess too, and there's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's a clash of cultures, and it seems like our government just doesn't understand that. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly.  You have to weigh the pros and cons carefully, and in this case, the cons far outweigh the pros.  It's like quicksand – once we went in, we got stuck.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason for us to stay there. The administration probably has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, and maybe there are some risks involved in leaving. But I haven't heard any convincing reasons why we shouldn't just go.\n\nIf they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have much of a problem with that. But the longer we stay, the worse it seems to get. I read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a lot of them want us to leave right now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nIf we ask them what they want, and they say they want us to leave, then at least we can say we gave them a choice. If things go bad after that, we can say we tried to do what was best, but they ultimately made the decision.  Maybe then we could at least be seen as the good guys, or at least less bad.",
            "Yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S. It's not just about women though. It's more about the specific field you're working in.  I mean, overall, women face tougher times because of that invisible \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is the goal, many people struggle to work for a woman in a leadership position, just because of how society's always been. So, often, women see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because traditionally, women haven't held top positions in business. And, I guess the same goes for men too.  \n\nThink about things like being a stay-at-home parent. It's super uncommon for a man to stay home while his wife works. People often judge them, assuming the man should be the breadwinner. It can be tough for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be at home with their kids, even if their wife has the higher-paying job.  But society doesn't get it.\n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Men who are into fashion, especially straight men, sometimes don't get taken seriously. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because people think guys who are into fashion have different lifestyles. So, if a guy fits the typical mold and he's in fashion, people might wonder, \"How can he really understand fashion if he's not more like us, the women?\"\n\nIt's like, depending on your field, there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, even though we've come a long way since the 1800s. Change is slow, but women are rising in business, becoming CEOs and getting more acceptance.  It's happening, and people are starting to get on board.\n\nThe same goes for stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the wife is the better earner, or maybe she just wants to work. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their wives or female friends and understanding where men are coming from.\n\nSo, we have to promote these stereotypes by showing off the good qualities of those who are usually looked down on, but not in a pushy way. You can't force change, or people will resist. We're in a good spot where things are starting to change naturally.  \n\nI don't think there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time, and we've already come a long way.  \n\nOh, and I think people discriminate against each other based on where they're from too. If a guy grew up on a farm and his grammar isn't perfect, but he's super smart and becomes a CEO, some men might make fun of him, saying things like, \"How can I trust you if you don't even speak correctly?\" You know?",
            "So, they didn't exactly make marijuana legal, they decriminalized it.  \n\nThink of it like this: instead of being a criminal offense, it's now more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited, but you don't get arrested, booked, or hauled into jail. \n\nThere are still some downsides though.  Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews might still be affected.  Those big, scary consequences of a drug charge, they don't always disappear.\n\nBut, on the other hand, getting caught with marijuana used to cost taxpayers a ton of money.  Think about it: arresting people, holding them in jail, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all adds up. \n\nPlaces that are struggling financially might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it saved them money. \n\nSome places, like Denver, are more open to the idea.  They might even use the money saved to fund things like education, social programs, and food assistance.  \n\nIt's important to remember that just because something is decriminalized doesn't mean it should be everywhere.  We need to be careful about how it's handled.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could end up like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it might just feel uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nI think alcohol actually has a bigger impact on your ability to drive safely, but marijuana can be more disruptive to someone's everyday life.  \n\nUltimately, every substance affects people differently.  Some people can handle it better than others.  It's tough to generalize.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do is pretty traditional. They've done things the same way for ages, and it's good to have those roots. But it's also important to be able to change with the times, you know?  \n\nA lot of Catholics think they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow every single rule perfectly.  They don't really accept people who aren't exactly \"ideal\" Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions either.  Like, for example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nIt doesn't seem very tolerant of other faiths to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic thing, but it feels hypocritical to say you love others and then not accept them the way they are.  So, a lot of Catholic teachings are about doing things a certain way, but then the way they actually practice goes against it because it's so stuck in the past.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests from abusing children. It's a whole different issue.  It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\n\nI mean, people who hurt children probably would do it whether or not they were married. It's about a power imbalance, not about being married or not. If someone is going to abuse a child, they're going to do it whether they have a spouse or not. I don't think letting priests get married would stop that from happening.",
            "I'm still figuring out my stance on this whole marriage equality debate. It's really tough, you know? It feels like it walks a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means.  It's hard not to offend anyone when you're trying to define something so personal. \n\nI'm leaning towards the idea that all unions, whether they're between two men, two women, or a man and a woman, should be treated as civil unions.  After all, the government doesn't get involved in religious ceremonies like baptism, right?  Why should marriage be any different?  It's about two people coming together, and that's what matters.\n\nI think it's important for the government to stay out of people's personal lives and not dictate who they can marry.  If all the states can agree on a reasonable solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law.  \n\nBut a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That seems extreme.  Changing the constitution shouldn't be taken lightly, especially for something like this. It's a big deal for some people, but I don't think it's important enough to warrant amending the constitution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe they should have the right to marry. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each individual state.\n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, while others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and people living there should be able to live in accordance with their state's values. If you choose to live in a state that legalizes it, you're essentially accepting that decision.\n\nBasically, I think everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities. So, I believe in leaving the decision of whether or not to legalize gay marriage up to each state. \n\nI don't think President Bush should have the power to ban it nationwide.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should govern itself. Plus, with a new president potentially coming in soon, it's likely to become a back-and-forth issue. It's best to let individual states make their own choices, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences.",
            "Look, I get it. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Whatever you post, anyone can see it. So if you're putting something on there, you kind of have to assume people are going to see it, even people like school officials. I mean, even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut when it comes to preventing something terrible like a school shooting, I think the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe. If they see something online that makes them think a student might be a danger, I think it's okay for them to look into it. \n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if it's about protecting kids, I think it's fine. \n\nThink about it: you wouldn't want to send your kid to a school where the staff wasn't doing everything they could to keep them safe, right? \n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to put anything nasty about someone in an email because you never know who might see it later.  Everything online can come back to bite you. \n\nSo, yeah, I think the school officials were justified in looking at the Myspace page. They were just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... at first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted revenge, you know? But looking back, I think we went in too emotionally.  We didn't really plan things out, and now I think it backfired.\n\nI don't think being there is helping. It seems like they're just fighting amongst themselves anyway, and we're caught in the middle.  Honestly, because of 9/11, I've kind of checked out. I don't care what happens over there anymore.\n\nIt's frustrating. They're so different from us when it comes to war. It's savage. They don't want to make their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were more angry than anything when we went in.  We wanted revenge, and I think President Bush let that dictate his actions.  But I get it, we couldn't just ignore what happened.\n\nI just wish we had a better plan. We didn't know what we were walking into, and I don't think we had a clear goal. There wasn't any unity. \n\nWe made some progress, but it's not enough.  We can't stay forever, and I honestly think things will just fall apart once we leave. We're hurting ourselves by staying there."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. Lately, I've heard they're losing members, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things.  \n\nTake things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these issues, which is fine, but some of those views seem pretty outdated. If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing followers.\n\nPeople are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics.  They see it as a negative thing, like if you believe in abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it.  Same with gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be in a group that opposes it.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a family and a job; why not priests?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage.  I think that whether someone is born that way or not, it's not a choice they make.  So, I feel like gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are attracted to. It doesn't seem fair to me that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  Honestly, I haven't thought about it too much, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\n\nI guess it's like this: I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay.  It doesn't feel like a choice either way. So, why should someone be held accountable for something they can't control? It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this. It's not a legal issue or really even a moral one.  I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal or treated like they made a bad decision.  \n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in this. It doesn't affect national security or morals. It just seems like they're overstepping boundaries.  People should be able to live their lives as they choose, and that includes who they love. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some people worry that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but that just doesn't make sense. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing just because they're both sides of a coin. They're different, but both valid.  \n\nThere are lots of civil rights tied to marriage, too. For example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be able to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's kind of unfair if you're committed to someone for life.\n\nPlus, research shows that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship dynamics as straight couples. It's just a relationship, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat gets people hung up is the idea of churches and religion. But gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're asking for a legal document from the government. If the government doesn't get involved in religious matters, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else. Some people worry about adoption and how it will affect children, but studies haven't shown any negative impacts. The biggest problem kids of same-sex couples face is bullying and prejudice from others.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely make gay marriage legal nationwide. It's a matter of equality and basic human rights. President Bush, however, seems to have strong religious beliefs that influence his stance on gay marriage, which aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. \n\nHis reasoning often comes down to morality, but morality is subjective and varies widely. It's not fair to impose the religious beliefs of one group on the entire country. Plus, it's hypocritical to oppose \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance while supporting laws based on religious beliefs.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or a result of childhood trauma.  But that's simply not true, according to the American Psychological Association. We need to base our views on facts and research, not on prejudice and misinformation.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take marijuana, for example.  I think it should be legal for medicinal purposes because its potential benefits shouldn't be ignored just because of its legal status.  It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nThink about it, pharmacies use lots of controlled substances like oxycontin, Vicodin, and Percocet all the time. They're helpful, right?  But there's this stigma around marijuana that makes people forget it could have similar benefits.\n\nAlcohol is different, though.  Both alcohol and marijuana can be abused, but I think we should focus on removing the taboo around marijuana first.  Maybe then people would use it more responsibly.\n\nHonestly, the way people view marijuana is totally unfair.  It's not nearly as dangerous as other drugs, so if we changed people's perceptions, they might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed and adapted to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be.  When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. That was the norm back then. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there every weekend.\n\nNow, things are different. They have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. You'll see families rushing in from the beach straight to church. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of the formal attire I wore before. It's definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing women priests or permitting priests to marry would have stopped those horrible acts.  There are married men who become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.  \n\nIf someone truly wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion, like some of the ones where ministers or reverends are allowed to marry. \n\nI think pedophilia has roots in genetics. It's something people are born with, not something they become.  You can't hide it through marriage. It might come out eventually. The church may have failed to address the issue properly in some cases, but I don't believe they could have prevented it altogether.",
            "Man, you know, at first I was cool with the idea of the Iraq War, but everyone was still super shook up from 9/11. It felt like we rushed into it, using it as an excuse.  I mean, the Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, and we all know that turned out to be a big fat lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush team straight-up lied to the American people, and they still haven't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that huge speech at the UN, now says he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong, plain and simple. It's like, how can you lie to the country like that? That's gotta be grounds for impeachment! And it's not just that; it feels like the Bush administration has been trying to push the Constitution aside ever since 9/11.\n\nIt seems like they came into office wanting to go to war. I can't remember the name of the Treasury Secretary who said this, but he wrote about it in his book after he got pushed out. It sounds like the younger Bush had some personal beef with Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. It's all pretty sneaky if you ask me.\n\nI think it's gone on long enough, though. If we pulled out right now, things could get really messy and even more people could die. It seems like the UN and the US are trying to get countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help set things right. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause more problems in the long run because it messes with Iraq's sovereignty. \n\nThe government is falling apart. The news says the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in charge. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has seats in Parliament!  We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for control, and it's creating a lot of chaos.",
            "I'm not sure how to put this into words.  It feels like a pointless war, you know? I mean, it wasn't even officially declared. It just feels like we invaded Iraq because we thought they were behind 9/11.  Honestly, I don't really follow the news about it closely. I don't know all the details.\n\nBut, from what I gather, we're still there trying to build democracy and get access to their oil.  The problem is, it's creating a lot of anger. Staying there forever to build a democracy will take ages, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up.\n\nIt's a real dilemma.  It makes me wonder if we should even call it a war anymore. We never actually declared it. It seems like we're just showing off our military power and trying to make ourselves look big.\n\nPart of me feels like we should stay and help them, but it's also costing us so much, and it's making President Bush look bad. I worry he'll become known as the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nThen there are the families with loved ones in Iraq. I hate to say it, but I want the war to end for them, but I also don't want us to just abandon the people of Iraq. They've lost so much.\n\nI feel like if we stay, we'll try to make them more like us, which could backfire. It might make things worse and fuel more hatred towards America. \n\nThis whole situation feels like it's going to drag on forever. Ugh, it's just so complicated.",
            "You know, I don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or for any state to even try to say it's okay.  It just seems like something the churches should decide for themselves. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and it seems to me that trying to control or influence this issue goes against what's already been established.\n\nI think people pushing to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe in some areas like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can or can't do.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution and something that allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even though there have been talks about making an amendment,  I think adding one about this would be completely wrong and go against what's already written. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that's actually used to restrict people instead of the government, which doesn't seem right.\n\nI firmly believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, shouldn't be involved in this. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's based on their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're just trying to favor one religion over all others.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't really a good reason to support this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else in a negative way. In fact, it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I really don't think the government was completely honest with us about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used our fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.  Personally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes.\n\nThis Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and we should have learned from our mistakes there.  A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and just removed the Iraqi government without really thinking about what would happen next. They didn't plan for the chaos, the power vacuum, and all the fallout. The US is trying to install a democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but pushing out Communists and trying to force democracy on a country is never easy. It's a long and difficult process, and we should have known that going in.\n\nIt wasn't a clear-cut victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss, because no matter how many people support you, there will always be insurgents. You can't defeat a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to, we needed to be prepared for everything. We weren't ready for the aftermath, for what would happen once they took out Saddam Hussein.\n\nWe're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a long process.  \n\nThe government kind of misled the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission. But implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history! It took a long struggle to get to the strong democracy we have today.\n\nSo, what do we do now? It's a tough decision. We can't just abandon Iraq now after everything we've done. But how many more lives are we willing to lose for a free and democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be honest, why just Iraq? Why not other countries? I think the oil is a big factor. We need that oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any. But North Korea has those weapons, and we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough.\n\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there, but I'm not very optimistic.",
            "I'm a big supporter of gay marriage, always have been.  It's a personal choice, and research shows it could even be biological rather than social.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control.  I think it's unfair and inhumane.  I've always been an advocate for equal rights for everyone, including gay couples.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal matter, something between two people and their families.  In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and being part of the community.  \n\nIt seems like President Bush is trying to play God by interpreting marriage in his own way. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from lots of sources that being gay might be a biological thing, something you're predisposed to. It's not a choice you make based on your upbringing or environment.  \n\nBesides the obvious, I think it's unfair that a couple can just run off and get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal. It should be a private matter, something between the couple and their family, not something that's splashed all over the news.  It shouldn't be a national issue.",
            "So, basically, when you put something on the internet, it's out there for everyone to see.  It's like a public space. As an RA, I've dealt with this before.  Once you post something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you're talking about causing harm, like explosions or shootings, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their posts.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if it's the school that got the alert, someone saw it and reported it. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just people messing around. Maybe it was a social experiment that went wrong, like for a sociology class. \n\nOr maybe it was something really serious. In this case, something happened at school, someone overheard a conversation, and they reported it. When they looked through the person's Facebook, they found things that were concerning, even if the person meant them as a joke. In the end, the internet doesn't offer much privacy. If you don't want people to see something, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it.\n\nIt's not okay for school officials to be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy because the person shared it with others. If there's a potential danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI think schools should focus on what's brought to their attention directly, not on monitoring phone calls, texts, or IMs.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on far too long. At the start, the goal seemed good—to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power, not for any real reason.  \n\nPlus, I wonder if the motives were ever truly pure. There were definitely connections to personal grudges between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to help establish democracy, that would be a noble cause. But if personal matters were involved, then it's not right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on way too long. We made our point in the beginning, but hanging on for years just isn't necessary. Their government and people need to figure things out on their own.\n\nIt's draining our economy. We're spending billions on a war that seems to have lost its purpose, while neglecting our own problems like poverty, failing infrastructure, and inadequate healthcare. That money could be better used to help our own citizens.  \n\nIt's just not right to keep pouring resources into a war that seems endless. We need to bring our troops home and focus on solving the issues we have right here at home.",
            "So, someone was asking if it was okay for someone to look at people's Myspace profiles to prevent something bad from happening.  I think it's pretty much fair game if you post something online, especially on a site like Myspace where you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. If you're friends with someone, you're giving them permission to see what you post.  \n\nIt's tough though, because you can't have someone constantly checking everyone's profiles. It would be like singling out certain kids as \"bad\" and targeting them. It's a tricky situation. Maybe it depends on the situation. If someone sees something specific that raises a red flag, then it might be justified. \n\nI personally have a Facebook, and it's unsettling knowing that anyone could see my information. I once saw a news story about a guy who easily found someone's information from their profile and started chatting with them. It's scary how much information is out there.  \n\nI try to be careful about what I share online, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a balancing act. \n\nI also heard that some high schools actually banned Myspace.  It seems strange to me that schools would have that kind of control over what their students do online.  It feels like a privacy issue.",
            "I feel awkward talking about the Iraq War, you know? It's hard not to feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon of people who were against it from the start.  But honestly, looking back, it's clear to me that it was a mistake.  Everyone seems to agree, except maybe for the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  There have been polls everywhere – in the U.S., Iraq, and globally – showing that 75 to 80% of people think the war was a bad idea.  Even a lot of the U.S. troops stationed there believe we should get out within the next year.\n\nIt feels like everything about the war has been a disaster, even before we even went in.  Pulling out is going to be a mess too, and there's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's a clash of cultures, and it seems like our government just doesn't understand that. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly.  You have to weigh the pros and cons carefully, and in this case, the cons far outweigh the pros.  It's like quicksand – once we went in, we got stuck.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason for us to stay there. The administration probably has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, and maybe there are some risks involved in leaving. But I haven't heard any convincing reasons why we shouldn't just go.\n\nIf they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have much of a problem with that. But the longer we stay, the worse it seems to get. I read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a lot of them want us to leave right now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nIf we ask them what they want, and they say they want us to leave, then at least we can say we gave them a choice. If things go bad after that, we can say we tried to do what was best, but they ultimately made the decision.  Maybe then we could at least be seen as the good guys, or at least less bad.",
            "Yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S. It's not just about women though. It's more about the specific field you're working in.  I mean, overall, women face tougher times because of that invisible \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is the goal, many people struggle to work for a woman in a leadership position, just because of how society's always been. So, often, women see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because traditionally, women haven't held top positions in business. And, I guess the same goes for men too.  \n\nThink about things like being a stay-at-home parent. It's super uncommon for a man to stay home while his wife works. People often judge them, assuming the man should be the breadwinner. It can be tough for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be at home with their kids, even if their wife has the higher-paying job.  But society doesn't get it.\n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Men who are into fashion, especially straight men, sometimes don't get taken seriously. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because people think guys who are into fashion have different lifestyles. So, if a guy fits the typical mold and he's in fashion, people might wonder, \"How can he really understand fashion if he's not more like us, the women?\"\n\nIt's like, depending on your field, there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, even though we've come a long way since the 1800s. Change is slow, but women are rising in business, becoming CEOs and getting more acceptance.  It's happening, and people are starting to get on board.\n\nThe same goes for stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the wife is the better earner, or maybe she just wants to work. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their wives or female friends and understanding where men are coming from.\n\nSo, we have to promote these stereotypes by showing off the good qualities of those who are usually looked down on, but not in a pushy way. You can't force change, or people will resist. We're in a good spot where things are starting to change naturally.  \n\nI don't think there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time, and we've already come a long way.  \n\nOh, and I think people discriminate against each other based on where they're from too. If a guy grew up on a farm and his grammar isn't perfect, but he's super smart and becomes a CEO, some men might make fun of him, saying things like, \"How can I trust you if you don't even speak correctly?\" You know?",
            "So, they didn't exactly make marijuana legal, they decriminalized it.  \n\nThink of it like this: instead of being a criminal offense, it's now more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited, but you don't get arrested, booked, or hauled into jail. \n\nThere are still some downsides though.  Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews might still be affected.  Those big, scary consequences of a drug charge, they don't always disappear.\n\nBut, on the other hand, getting caught with marijuana used to cost taxpayers a ton of money.  Think about it: arresting people, holding them in jail, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all adds up. \n\nPlaces that are struggling financially might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it saved them money. \n\nSome places, like Denver, are more open to the idea.  They might even use the money saved to fund things like education, social programs, and food assistance.  \n\nIt's important to remember that just because something is decriminalized doesn't mean it should be everywhere.  We need to be careful about how it's handled.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could end up like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it might just feel uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nI think alcohol actually has a bigger impact on your ability to drive safely, but marijuana can be more disruptive to someone's everyday life.  \n\nUltimately, every substance affects people differently.  Some people can handle it better than others.  It's tough to generalize.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do is pretty traditional. They've done things the same way for ages, and it's good to have those roots. But it's also important to be able to change with the times, you know?  \n\nA lot of Catholics think they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow every single rule perfectly.  They don't really accept people who aren't exactly \"ideal\" Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions either.  Like, for example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nIt doesn't seem very tolerant of other faiths to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic thing, but it feels hypocritical to say you love others and then not accept them the way they are.  So, a lot of Catholic teachings are about doing things a certain way, but then the way they actually practice goes against it because it's so stuck in the past.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests from abusing children. It's a whole different issue.  It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\n\nI mean, people who hurt children probably would do it whether or not they were married. It's about a power imbalance, not about being married or not. If someone is going to abuse a child, they're going to do it whether they have a spouse or not. I don't think letting priests get married would stop that from happening.",
            "I'm still figuring out my stance on this whole marriage equality debate. It's really tough, you know? It feels like it walks a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means.  It's hard not to offend anyone when you're trying to define something so personal. \n\nI'm leaning towards the idea that all unions, whether they're between two men, two women, or a man and a woman, should be treated as civil unions.  After all, the government doesn't get involved in religious ceremonies like baptism, right?  Why should marriage be any different?  It's about two people coming together, and that's what matters.\n\nI think it's important for the government to stay out of people's personal lives and not dictate who they can marry.  If all the states can agree on a reasonable solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law.  \n\nBut a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That seems extreme.  Changing the constitution shouldn't be taken lightly, especially for something like this. It's a big deal for some people, but I don't think it's important enough to warrant amending the constitution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe they should have the right to marry. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each individual state.\n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, while others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and people living there should be able to live in accordance with their state's values. If you choose to live in a state that legalizes it, you're essentially accepting that decision.\n\nBasically, I think everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities. So, I believe in leaving the decision of whether or not to legalize gay marriage up to each state. \n\nI don't think President Bush should have the power to ban it nationwide.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should govern itself. Plus, with a new president potentially coming in soon, it's likely to become a back-and-forth issue. It's best to let individual states make their own choices, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences.",
            "Look, I get it. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Whatever you post, anyone can see it. So if you're putting something on there, you kind of have to assume people are going to see it, even people like school officials. I mean, even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut when it comes to preventing something terrible like a school shooting, I think the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe. If they see something online that makes them think a student might be a danger, I think it's okay for them to look into it. \n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if it's about protecting kids, I think it's fine. \n\nThink about it: you wouldn't want to send your kid to a school where the staff wasn't doing everything they could to keep them safe, right? \n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to put anything nasty about someone in an email because you never know who might see it later.  Everything online can come back to bite you. \n\nSo, yeah, I think the school officials were justified in looking at the Myspace page. They were just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... at first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted revenge, you know? But looking back, I think we went in too emotionally.  We didn't really plan things out, and now I think it backfired.\n\nI don't think being there is helping. It seems like they're just fighting amongst themselves anyway, and we're caught in the middle.  Honestly, because of 9/11, I've kind of checked out. I don't care what happens over there anymore.\n\nIt's frustrating. They're so different from us when it comes to war. It's savage. They don't want to make their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were more angry than anything when we went in.  We wanted revenge, and I think President Bush let that dictate his actions.  But I get it, we couldn't just ignore what happened.\n\nI just wish we had a better plan. We didn't know what we were walking into, and I don't think we had a clear goal. There wasn't any unity. \n\nWe made some progress, but it's not enough.  We can't stay forever, and I honestly think things will just fall apart once we leave. We're hurting ourselves by staying there."
