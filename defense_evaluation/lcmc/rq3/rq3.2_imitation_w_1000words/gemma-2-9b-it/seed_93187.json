            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to update some of its views. I've heard they're losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but their stance feels a bit outdated. If they were more open to modern thinking, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing people.  \n\nI've heard people are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these topics.  It's understandable that someone who supports abortion or gay marriage wouldn't feel comfortable in a community that condemns those things.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they couldn't have female priests or allow priests to get married. It seems unfair that they're expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else has a family life outside of work.",
            "Okay, so, I'm not against gay marriage. I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, sexuality isn't something you choose. So, I don't think we should blame people for how they are attracted to others. You know, it seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too hard, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right. It just doesn't seem like a choice, like how some people are born straight and others gay.  It's just how they are.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not really a legal or moral issue. It's just about people being who they are. It's not like they're making a bad choice or something.\n\nIt just feels wrong to make them feel like they're doing something wrong. They shouldn't be treated differently just because of who they love.  It's not like it affects anyone else's safety or anything. It's just their personal lives.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to legalize it. Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but I think it's totally different. It's like two sides of the same coin – they're not the same, but they're connected. \n\nThere are also tons of civil rights issues tied to it. For example, if you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner might not be allowed to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital. It just doesn't seem right if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nPlus, lots of studies show that gay relationships are just as successful as straight relationships. They have the same ingredients for a happy partnership.\n\nReally, it's about marriage certificates and legal rights, not church weddings. If the government keeps religion out of it, there shouldn't be a problem.\n\nIt's kind of like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about things like adoption and how a gay couple living in their community will affect everyone. They also wonder how children of gay couples will adjust.\n\nBut honestly, it's mostly new territory. Parenting skills are the same for everyone, whether they're gay or straight.\n\nI think the federal government should get involved and make same-sex marriage legal in all states.  President Bush seems to have really strong religious views against it, which might be linked to his stance on abortion and stem cell research.  \n\nBut I think it's important to remember that morality is different for everyone.  Just because some religious groups oppose gay marriage doesn't mean the government should enforce their beliefs on everyone. \n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological problem caused by childhood trauma or a personality flaw. But the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. \n\nWe should listen to experts and research instead of just believing what's popular or what our friends tell us.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've learned a thing or two.  Just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take drugs, for instance.  I mean, making them available to the public?  Absolutely not.  But using them for medical reasons?  Definitely yes.  It's all about the context.  \n\nThink about it: there are tons of legal drugs, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, that pharmacies use all the time. They're controlled substances, but they're super helpful.  If we're okay with those, why not consider marijuana for its potential benefits?\n\nIt's not exactly like alcohol, though. Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and so can marijuana. But I think we should approach marijuana differently.  Maybe a gradual legalization process would be better, step by step, so it doesn't get out of hand.  We need to ditch the stigma surrounding marijuana first.  Once people see it's not the scary monster everyone thinks it is, they might use it responsibly.\n\nHonestly, people have such a warped view of marijuana just because it's illegal. It's not like heroin or cocaine, you know?  If we get rid of that image, people could use it responsibly. And definitely for medical purposes!",
            "I think the church has modernized to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday in cute dresses, matching shoes and a purse.  I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long.  People dress much more casually, especially in the summer, coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more relaxed. That's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped these situations. Some married men become pedophiles too. It's a personal issue, not a matter of being able to marry or not. Priests choose to become priests, and if they want to be married while practicing their faith, maybe they should consider another religion. There are religions where priests can marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  \n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. It's something people are born with, not something they choose. Marriage wouldn't change that.  If the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's terrible. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were going with the whole Iraq thing at first, but it was right after 9/11, and everyone was super shook up.  I think they used 9/11 as a way to justify going into Iraq, saying that Saddam Hussein had ties to Osama Bin Laden and weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, none of that was true, and that really rubs me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nHonestly, it feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people about everything. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has said he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a huge betrayal of trust, something that should be impeachable.  It feels like they've just been disrespecting the Constitution ever since 9/11.  \n\nI have a feeling they went into office wanting to go to war.  I remember reading a book by the Treasury Secretary, who basically said that Bush Jr. had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's dealings with him. And on top of that, I think Bush Jr. was hoping to secure more energy resources for the U.S. through the war.  It all feels very manipulative.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough.  Pulling out right now would probably cause a civil war and more deaths, though.  They're trying this thing with a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's going to create problems with Iraq's sovereignty in the long run.\n\nWith the news I've seen, the Parliament doesn't seem to be doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any control.  Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has a bunch of seats in Parliament. There are still so many radical groups fighting for power, and it's creating a lot of tension.",
            "Ugh, the War in Iraq... it's a mess. I mean, it's not even officially a war, which is kinda weird. It feels like it was all about revenge for 9/11, like we just wanted to hit back at whoever we thought did it.  I don't really follow the details, but it seems like we're just stuck there now, trying to build a democracy and get our hands on some oil. But honestly, it's just making everyone angry.  \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is taking forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad because they feel like we messed everything up. It's a lose-lose situation.  \n\nI don't know, it's a hard topic. It feels like we're using our military power to show off, like we're bigger and better. But it doesn't feel right.  We didn't even officially declare war, and now it's dragging on and on. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation where everything feels pointless.\n\nPlus, there are so many families with loved ones over there. I want them to come home safe, but it also feels wrong to stay and change their culture. It's a whole mess. I think this thing is going to keep going for years and years.",
            "Listen, I really don't think it's right for the government to make laws about this.  The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices goes against that.  It feels like picking sides, favoring one church's beliefs over another.  For example, most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in some areas like Boston.  I just don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of what allows for religious freedom in the US. Even though there's talk about making an amendment, I think that's completely wrong.  It would go against what's already in the Constitution and would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, should get involved. It seems like this push for an amendment is just based on personal beliefs, specifically the president's Catholic views. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all others.  This decision should be left up to the churches themselves.  There's no real reason for a government amendment beyond personal opinions. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else, and it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the Iraq War...  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading Iraq, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11 and used that outrage to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq War feels a lot like a repeat of Vietnam. We should have learned from our past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible.  \n\nThe US removed Iraq's government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. They were trying to install a democracy, similar to what happened in Vietnam, where we tried to push out communists and promote democracy. But the US government should have known that wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and there's no guarantee of a clear victory.\n\nIn both Vietnam and Iraq, there were always going to be insurgents, even if some people supported the US intervention. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for any of this. They should have planned for all possible outcomes before going to war.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, but it's a slow process.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war would be quick and successful, but it's far from it.  It takes time to build a new government and a stable society, as we saw in our own country's history.\n\nSo, the war in Iraq is a tough situation. We've been there for so long, it's hard to just walk away. But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice? \n\nIt also makes you wonder why we're only focused on Iraq. Why not other countries with problems, like North Korea? I think the oil issue plays a big part. We need to ask ourselves if this is really about freedom and democracy, or if it's about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. Yet, we aren't doing anything about North Korea, which we know has these weapons.  \n\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure that's going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I just think it's a personal preference, something that's becoming more and more clear is biological, not sociological. It doesn't make sense to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong to me. I've always supported gay marriage. \n\nAnd honestly, politics and government shouldn't be involved. It's not a state or national issue; it's about personal relationships and families. Like, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though — walk their dogs, hang out, you know?  It's frustrating that Bush is trying to define marriage in his own way. It just seems ridiculous.\n\nThere's so much research now showing that being gay might be biological, a chemical thing in the brain, not something you choose. It's like being predisposed to something, not a result of your upbringing.\n\nBesides the obvious, it feels like marriage is different for gay couples.  A straight couple can just elope to Vegas if they want, but a gay couple wanting to get married makes headlines.  It shouldn't be such a big deal. It's a private matter, not something that needs to be public.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal: anything you post online becomes public knowledge.  It's out there for everyone to see. As an RA, I've had to deal with this firsthand.  Whatever you put on the internet  shapes how people perceive you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that kind of stuff out into the world. The internet is global; if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nThe school didn't magically receive a bulletin; someone went to them with this information. They have to act on these kinds of threats because, imagine if something happened, and they could have prevented it. \n\nBut it's a tricky situation because you don't always know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a harmless joke gone wrong, like a sociology class experiment, or it could be something truly dangerous.  \n\nIn our school's case, someone overheard a conversation, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked at the student's Facebook page because some things he posted, while maybe intended as a joke, became very concerning in light of the situation.\n\nThe bottom line is, when you share things online, there's no real expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret things or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles.  It's a violation of privacy.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on way too long. At the beginning, the intention seemed good – to bring democracy to a country lacking fair political systems. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now it feels like we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. \n\nHonestly, I have doubts about the initial motives too. There were those past conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein that might have played a role.\n\nIf the goal was to help a country oppressed by a dictator achieve democracy, that would be a justifiable reason. But if personal vendettas were involved, that wouldn't be right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on far too long. We made our point in the initial months, demonstrating our military strength. But years later, it just feels excessive.\n\nI believe our original purpose has become muddled and distorted. It seems like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a decisive victory, instead of for a clear, achievable goal.\n\nIt's time to end this war. Their government and officials need to take responsibility for their own country. We've already drained our economy, spending billions on a conflict that's lost its meaning.\n\nWe have pressing issues at home – poverty, inadequate infrastructure, healthcare – that deserve our attention and funding. Spending billions on a prolonged war that has lost its purpose is draining our resources from these critical areas. \n\nWe need to stop this war and invest in our own people and our own future.",
            "Can I ask something to make sure I understand? It sounds like this situation was stopped because someone saw something online, right?\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nHonestly, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.  On sites like Myspace, if you put information out there, it's basically public knowledge. I get that on Myspace you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you accept someone as a friend, you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nSo, if you post something online, you should know that lots of people might see it. If I think that in this case, someone seeing that information online and preventing a tragedy was a good thing.\n\nThat's a tough one though.  I mean, you can't have one person constantly checking everyone's profiles at school to prevent something bad from happening. But then, if they start focusing on \"bad kids\" and looking at their profiles, that feels like discrimination.\n\nI don't think it would be fair to have someone's job be to monitor people's profiles all day.  But maybe it depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence of something specific, or were they just randomly browsing? It's hard to say.\n\n\nI don't personally have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw a news story once about a guy who could easily find people's information online. He got a girl's screen name from her profile and started talking to her on instant messenger. He managed to get her to meet him in less than a minute. \n\nPersonally, I would never do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their screen names. They know it's me, though. It's strange because they seem to know a lot about me - my interests, what I look like, even my class schedule and who my friends are. They can see all sorts of photos too. I try to be careful about what I post, but at the same time, Facebook is supposed to be a way to connect with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me. I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how the school has the right to tell students they can't use Myspace.",
            "Hmm, you know, talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical. I hate to jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start, but I was.  It's not really a big deal anymore though, because everyone pretty much agrees it was a bad idea except for those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nLook at the polls - they've done them everywhere, in the US, Iraq, even globally, and  it's pretty clear: 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad call. Eighty percent of Iraqis feel the same way, and even 70% of US troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from day one.  It was a disaster before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another disaster.  \n\nThere's just no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. It's a clash of cultures - the US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and previous ones, think they can just force democracy on a region where it doesn't fit. It's just not how those people want to live.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a complete disaster.  It's like quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons. \n\nIf they want to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that. But I just don't see why we shouldn't leave now. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better.\n\nAt least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say, \"We were going to stay, but you guys made the decision to leave.\"\n\nMaybe that would make us the \"good guys\" - not really, no, never truly. But it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. \n\nAnd it's not just about women. I think it depends on the specific field you're in. \n\nFor women, overall, I feel like they face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to exist, a lot of people still struggle to accept having a woman in a leadership position, especially if it's over a man. This is because of how society has been for so long.\n\nWomen often hit a point where they're qualified for a promotion, but the board might not choose them because of the historical stereotype that women aren't usually in leadership roles. \n\nIt's similar for men too, though. Think about things like the fashion industry or staying at home as a parent. \n\nIt's uncommon for a man to stay at home while the woman works. People sometimes judge that because society expects men to be the primary earners. But maybe the husband wants to be with the kids, and the wife has the better job. It can be really hard for them because society doesn't see it as the \"normal\" arrangement.\n\nAnd in fashion, straight men can sometimes struggle to be taken seriously.  It might sound weird, but it's probably because people associate fashion with women. If a man has a \"typical\" lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might wonder if he really understands women's fashion. \n\nBasically, I think gender discrimination exists in different ways depending on your field.\n\nChanging it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change takes time.  \n\nThe good news is, we're seeing progress. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in the business world. We're also seeing more stay-at-home dads being accepted because people are realizing that sometimes it works better that way. \n\nIt's all about showing the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. If you force things, people resist. \n\nWe're at a good point now where things are slowly changing, but it takes time.",
            "They didn't actually legalize marijuana; they decriminalized it.  That means it's not a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited instead of arrested and booked.  I think that if someone gets caught with it and gets cited, it can still have consequences for things like job interviews. Those kinds of negative impacts are usually the worst part of having a drug charge.  Even with decriminalization, people worry about those future repercussions.  \n\nBut on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest, book, and house people, plus court costs, public defenders, and the state attorney’s office. All that adds up. So when cities are struggling financially, some aren't willing to make that change, even if it would free up money for things like public education, social programs, and food assistance. Some communities just strongly oppose marijuana and don't want to decriminalize it.  \n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, might be fine with it because it frees up resources. I think it's important because marijuana shouldn't just be readily available everywhere. There are lots of reasons for that, but the financial aspect is a big one too.\n\nIf it were fully legalized, it could be like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked openly. That might lead to more people smoking and driving. Plus, marijuana is still seen as taboo in many places and contexts. Seeing it out in the open like that could feel awkward for some people.\n\nAlcohol probably has more immediate negative effects on motor skills, but for a lot of people, marijuana has a bigger impact on their lifestyle overall. Both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle moderation, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize because people react so differently to substances.",
            "I'd say, yeah, there are good and bad things about being Catholic.  They've got a lot of traditions they've stuck with for ages, and that can be nice.  It's comforting to have those roots. But, sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't adapt well to change.  Like, a lot of Catholics feel they *have* to go to church every week, and there are strict rules about everything. And, honestly, it feels like they judge people pretty harshly if they don't follow the rules perfectly. \n\nThey don't seem very accepting of people who aren't exactly like them, either.  For example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Isn't that supposed to be a loving religion?  It seems hypocritical to preach love but then turn around and reject people because they don't fit in.\n\nIt's like, they tell you to love everyone, but their actions don't always match those words.  They cling to old rules even though they don't seem to make sense in the modern world.\n\nNow, about priests getting married... I think it'd be good if they could.  But, I don't know if it would really stop the bad stuff that happens sometimes.  Those issues are way more complicated than just whether or not a priest is married. It's a sad thing that happens, and I don't think marriage would magically fix it.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this whole marriage equality issue. I honestly can't say if one side is right or wrong because it's such a complex problem. It's a real tightrope walk between separating church and state and figuring out what marriage truly means. \n\nIt's tough because defining marriage without upsetting anyone is nearly impossible. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining marriage at all, especially when it's seen as a religious sacrament.  Think about it – the government doesn't get involved in how people practice their religion, so why should they dictate who can get married? \n\nMaybe it's simpler to just see it as civil unions.  It's about two people committing to each other, regardless of their beliefs or sexual orientation. The government shouldn't care about the specifics of the ceremony, just that two people want to be together. \n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for a federal law. But, changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That just seems extreme. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for something like this, even if it's important to some people. It's not a big enough issue to warrant such a drastic change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I have lots of gay friends, so it's not a black-and-white issue. While I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a nationwide debate, though.  \n\nI think each state should decide for itself whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage.  Some states lean Democratic, and those are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that's okay with it, you're probably going to be fine with their decision. And honestly, if you choose to live somewhere, you kind of accept their views, right?\n\nI think everyone deserves equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. So, I feel strongly that the legality of gay marriage should be left up to the states.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush should have the power to ban gay marriage nationwide. It should be up to the individual states to decide what's best for them. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be making that kind of decision for everyone.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon.  If a Democratic president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth.  It's better to let each state make its own choice. After all, they're the ones who'll have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they're coming from. I mean, Myspace is basically like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see.  It doesn't matter if you're using your school's name or not, anyone can find it, even from their own homes.  \n\nI think the school officials were right to look at it. If it helps prevent something terrible like a school shooting, that's important. Protecting the students is the school's job, and if they had information about a potential threat, they had a responsibility to act.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a legitimate reason, like preventing harm, then I think it's okay.\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to say something bad about someone in an email because you never know who might read it.  Everything you put online can come back to haunt you later.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.  It's good to be able to express yourself online, but you have to be careful what you say. It's a public space, and anything you post can be seen by anyone, even the school.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was totally on board. Nine/Eleven hit me personally, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we were all just so emotional after that, we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and honestly, I think it backfired.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It feels like the people over there are so caught up in fighting each other that they'll always be at each other's throats, regardless of us being there.  \n\nIt's hard, because of Nine/Eleven, I've kind of just checked out. I don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like, they can't even get along with each other, how are they going to get better?  Sometimes I don't even think they're human, the way they fight.\n\nWe went in blind. We had no idea what we were facing. Their idea of war is so different from ours, they're just savage. I don't think they want to improve their country, they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave it alone. \n\nI think we were mostly just angry and fueled by revenge. We didn't think about the long-term consequences or how they'd react. President Bush, he probably felt pressured, like we had no choice but to declare war on Iraq after what happened.\n\nBut honestly, we should have had a better plan. We were all over the place, with no clear goals or unity. Maybe if we'd gone in with a clear strategy, things would have been different. I just feel like we were all so emotionally driven, and that's what we ended up creating over there. \n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're probably always going to be like this. I just don't know what else to say. This whole thing has dragged on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  \n\nI think no matter how long we stay, things will fall apart as soon as we leave. We can't be there forever, and I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to update some of its views. I've heard they're losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but their stance feels a bit outdated. If they were more open to modern thinking, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing people.  \n\nI've heard people are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these topics.  It's understandable that someone who supports abortion or gay marriage wouldn't feel comfortable in a community that condemns those things.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they couldn't have female priests or allow priests to get married. It seems unfair that they're expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else has a family life outside of work.",
            "Okay, so, I'm not against gay marriage. I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, sexuality isn't something you choose. So, I don't think we should blame people for how they are attracted to others. You know, it seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too hard, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right. It just doesn't seem like a choice, like how some people are born straight and others gay.  It's just how they are.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not really a legal or moral issue. It's just about people being who they are. It's not like they're making a bad choice or something.\n\nIt just feels wrong to make them feel like they're doing something wrong. They shouldn't be treated differently just because of who they love.  It's not like it affects anyone else's safety or anything. It's just their personal lives.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to legalize it. Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but I think it's totally different. It's like two sides of the same coin – they're not the same, but they're connected. \n\nThere are also tons of civil rights issues tied to it. For example, if you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner might not be allowed to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital. It just doesn't seem right if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nPlus, lots of studies show that gay relationships are just as successful as straight relationships. They have the same ingredients for a happy partnership.\n\nReally, it's about marriage certificates and legal rights, not church weddings. If the government keeps religion out of it, there shouldn't be a problem.\n\nIt's kind of like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about things like adoption and how a gay couple living in their community will affect everyone. They also wonder how children of gay couples will adjust.\n\nBut honestly, it's mostly new territory. Parenting skills are the same for everyone, whether they're gay or straight.\n\nI think the federal government should get involved and make same-sex marriage legal in all states.  President Bush seems to have really strong religious views against it, which might be linked to his stance on abortion and stem cell research.  \n\nBut I think it's important to remember that morality is different for everyone.  Just because some religious groups oppose gay marriage doesn't mean the government should enforce their beliefs on everyone. \n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological problem caused by childhood trauma or a personality flaw. But the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. \n\nWe should listen to experts and research instead of just believing what's popular or what our friends tell us.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've learned a thing or two.  Just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take drugs, for instance.  I mean, making them available to the public?  Absolutely not.  But using them for medical reasons?  Definitely yes.  It's all about the context.  \n\nThink about it: there are tons of legal drugs, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, that pharmacies use all the time. They're controlled substances, but they're super helpful.  If we're okay with those, why not consider marijuana for its potential benefits?\n\nIt's not exactly like alcohol, though. Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and so can marijuana. But I think we should approach marijuana differently.  Maybe a gradual legalization process would be better, step by step, so it doesn't get out of hand.  We need to ditch the stigma surrounding marijuana first.  Once people see it's not the scary monster everyone thinks it is, they might use it responsibly.\n\nHonestly, people have such a warped view of marijuana just because it's illegal. It's not like heroin or cocaine, you know?  If we get rid of that image, people could use it responsibly. And definitely for medical purposes!",
            "I think the church has modernized to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday in cute dresses, matching shoes and a purse.  I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long.  People dress much more casually, especially in the summer, coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more relaxed. That's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped these situations. Some married men become pedophiles too. It's a personal issue, not a matter of being able to marry or not. Priests choose to become priests, and if they want to be married while practicing their faith, maybe they should consider another religion. There are religions where priests can marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  \n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. It's something people are born with, not something they choose. Marriage wouldn't change that.  If the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's terrible. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were going with the whole Iraq thing at first, but it was right after 9/11, and everyone was super shook up.  I think they used 9/11 as a way to justify going into Iraq, saying that Saddam Hussein had ties to Osama Bin Laden and weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, none of that was true, and that really rubs me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nHonestly, it feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people about everything. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has said he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a huge betrayal of trust, something that should be impeachable.  It feels like they've just been disrespecting the Constitution ever since 9/11.  \n\nI have a feeling they went into office wanting to go to war.  I remember reading a book by the Treasury Secretary, who basically said that Bush Jr. had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's dealings with him. And on top of that, I think Bush Jr. was hoping to secure more energy resources for the U.S. through the war.  It all feels very manipulative.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough.  Pulling out right now would probably cause a civil war and more deaths, though.  They're trying this thing with a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's going to create problems with Iraq's sovereignty in the long run.\n\nWith the news I've seen, the Parliament doesn't seem to be doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any control.  Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has a bunch of seats in Parliament. There are still so many radical groups fighting for power, and it's creating a lot of tension.",
            "Ugh, the War in Iraq... it's a mess. I mean, it's not even officially a war, which is kinda weird. It feels like it was all about revenge for 9/11, like we just wanted to hit back at whoever we thought did it.  I don't really follow the details, but it seems like we're just stuck there now, trying to build a democracy and get our hands on some oil. But honestly, it's just making everyone angry.  \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is taking forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad because they feel like we messed everything up. It's a lose-lose situation.  \n\nI don't know, it's a hard topic. It feels like we're using our military power to show off, like we're bigger and better. But it doesn't feel right.  We didn't even officially declare war, and now it's dragging on and on. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation where everything feels pointless.\n\nPlus, there are so many families with loved ones over there. I want them to come home safe, but it also feels wrong to stay and change their culture. It's a whole mess. I think this thing is going to keep going for years and years.",
            "Listen, I really don't think it's right for the government to make laws about this.  The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices goes against that.  It feels like picking sides, favoring one church's beliefs over another.  For example, most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in some areas like Boston.  I just don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of what allows for religious freedom in the US. Even though there's talk about making an amendment, I think that's completely wrong.  It would go against what's already in the Constitution and would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, should get involved. It seems like this push for an amendment is just based on personal beliefs, specifically the president's Catholic views. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all others.  This decision should be left up to the churches themselves.  There's no real reason for a government amendment beyond personal opinions. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else, and it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the Iraq War...  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading Iraq, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11 and used that outrage to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq War feels a lot like a repeat of Vietnam. We should have learned from our past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible.  \n\nThe US removed Iraq's government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. They were trying to install a democracy, similar to what happened in Vietnam, where we tried to push out communists and promote democracy. But the US government should have known that wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and there's no guarantee of a clear victory.\n\nIn both Vietnam and Iraq, there were always going to be insurgents, even if some people supported the US intervention. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for any of this. They should have planned for all possible outcomes before going to war.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, but it's a slow process.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war would be quick and successful, but it's far from it.  It takes time to build a new government and a stable society, as we saw in our own country's history.\n\nSo, the war in Iraq is a tough situation. We've been there for so long, it's hard to just walk away. But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice? \n\nIt also makes you wonder why we're only focused on Iraq. Why not other countries with problems, like North Korea? I think the oil issue plays a big part. We need to ask ourselves if this is really about freedom and democracy, or if it's about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. Yet, we aren't doing anything about North Korea, which we know has these weapons.  \n\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure that's going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I just think it's a personal preference, something that's becoming more and more clear is biological, not sociological. It doesn't make sense to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong to me. I've always supported gay marriage. \n\nAnd honestly, politics and government shouldn't be involved. It's not a state or national issue; it's about personal relationships and families. Like, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though — walk their dogs, hang out, you know?  It's frustrating that Bush is trying to define marriage in his own way. It just seems ridiculous.\n\nThere's so much research now showing that being gay might be biological, a chemical thing in the brain, not something you choose. It's like being predisposed to something, not a result of your upbringing.\n\nBesides the obvious, it feels like marriage is different for gay couples.  A straight couple can just elope to Vegas if they want, but a gay couple wanting to get married makes headlines.  It shouldn't be such a big deal. It's a private matter, not something that needs to be public.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal: anything you post online becomes public knowledge.  It's out there for everyone to see. As an RA, I've had to deal with this firsthand.  Whatever you put on the internet  shapes how people perceive you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that kind of stuff out into the world. The internet is global; if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nThe school didn't magically receive a bulletin; someone went to them with this information. They have to act on these kinds of threats because, imagine if something happened, and they could have prevented it. \n\nBut it's a tricky situation because you don't always know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a harmless joke gone wrong, like a sociology class experiment, or it could be something truly dangerous.  \n\nIn our school's case, someone overheard a conversation, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked at the student's Facebook page because some things he posted, while maybe intended as a joke, became very concerning in light of the situation.\n\nThe bottom line is, when you share things online, there's no real expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret things or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles.  It's a violation of privacy.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on way too long. At the beginning, the intention seemed good – to bring democracy to a country lacking fair political systems. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now it feels like we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. \n\nHonestly, I have doubts about the initial motives too. There were those past conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein that might have played a role.\n\nIf the goal was to help a country oppressed by a dictator achieve democracy, that would be a justifiable reason. But if personal vendettas were involved, that wouldn't be right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on far too long. We made our point in the initial months, demonstrating our military strength. But years later, it just feels excessive.\n\nI believe our original purpose has become muddled and distorted. It seems like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a decisive victory, instead of for a clear, achievable goal.\n\nIt's time to end this war. Their government and officials need to take responsibility for their own country. We've already drained our economy, spending billions on a conflict that's lost its meaning.\n\nWe have pressing issues at home – poverty, inadequate infrastructure, healthcare – that deserve our attention and funding. Spending billions on a prolonged war that has lost its purpose is draining our resources from these critical areas. \n\nWe need to stop this war and invest in our own people and our own future.",
            "Can I ask something to make sure I understand? It sounds like this situation was stopped because someone saw something online, right?\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nHonestly, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.  On sites like Myspace, if you put information out there, it's basically public knowledge. I get that on Myspace you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you accept someone as a friend, you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nSo, if you post something online, you should know that lots of people might see it. If I think that in this case, someone seeing that information online and preventing a tragedy was a good thing.\n\nThat's a tough one though.  I mean, you can't have one person constantly checking everyone's profiles at school to prevent something bad from happening. But then, if they start focusing on \"bad kids\" and looking at their profiles, that feels like discrimination.\n\nI don't think it would be fair to have someone's job be to monitor people's profiles all day.  But maybe it depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence of something specific, or were they just randomly browsing? It's hard to say.\n\n\nI don't personally have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw a news story once about a guy who could easily find people's information online. He got a girl's screen name from her profile and started talking to her on instant messenger. He managed to get her to meet him in less than a minute. \n\nPersonally, I would never do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their screen names. They know it's me, though. It's strange because they seem to know a lot about me - my interests, what I look like, even my class schedule and who my friends are. They can see all sorts of photos too. I try to be careful about what I post, but at the same time, Facebook is supposed to be a way to connect with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me. I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how the school has the right to tell students they can't use Myspace.",
            "Hmm, you know, talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical. I hate to jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start, but I was.  It's not really a big deal anymore though, because everyone pretty much agrees it was a bad idea except for those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nLook at the polls - they've done them everywhere, in the US, Iraq, even globally, and  it's pretty clear: 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad call. Eighty percent of Iraqis feel the same way, and even 70% of US troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from day one.  It was a disaster before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another disaster.  \n\nThere's just no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. It's a clash of cultures - the US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and previous ones, think they can just force democracy on a region where it doesn't fit. It's just not how those people want to live.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a complete disaster.  It's like quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons. \n\nIf they want to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that. But I just don't see why we shouldn't leave now. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better.\n\nAt least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say, \"We were going to stay, but you guys made the decision to leave.\"\n\nMaybe that would make us the \"good guys\" - not really, no, never truly. But it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. \n\nAnd it's not just about women. I think it depends on the specific field you're in. \n\nFor women, overall, I feel like they face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to exist, a lot of people still struggle to accept having a woman in a leadership position, especially if it's over a man. This is because of how society has been for so long.\n\nWomen often hit a point where they're qualified for a promotion, but the board might not choose them because of the historical stereotype that women aren't usually in leadership roles. \n\nIt's similar for men too, though. Think about things like the fashion industry or staying at home as a parent. \n\nIt's uncommon for a man to stay at home while the woman works. People sometimes judge that because society expects men to be the primary earners. But maybe the husband wants to be with the kids, and the wife has the better job. It can be really hard for them because society doesn't see it as the \"normal\" arrangement.\n\nAnd in fashion, straight men can sometimes struggle to be taken seriously.  It might sound weird, but it's probably because people associate fashion with women. If a man has a \"typical\" lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might wonder if he really understands women's fashion. \n\nBasically, I think gender discrimination exists in different ways depending on your field.\n\nChanging it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change takes time.  \n\nThe good news is, we're seeing progress. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in the business world. We're also seeing more stay-at-home dads being accepted because people are realizing that sometimes it works better that way. \n\nIt's all about showing the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. If you force things, people resist. \n\nWe're at a good point now where things are slowly changing, but it takes time.",
            "They didn't actually legalize marijuana; they decriminalized it.  That means it's not a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited instead of arrested and booked.  I think that if someone gets caught with it and gets cited, it can still have consequences for things like job interviews. Those kinds of negative impacts are usually the worst part of having a drug charge.  Even with decriminalization, people worry about those future repercussions.  \n\nBut on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest, book, and house people, plus court costs, public defenders, and the state attorney’s office. All that adds up. So when cities are struggling financially, some aren't willing to make that change, even if it would free up money for things like public education, social programs, and food assistance. Some communities just strongly oppose marijuana and don't want to decriminalize it.  \n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, might be fine with it because it frees up resources. I think it's important because marijuana shouldn't just be readily available everywhere. There are lots of reasons for that, but the financial aspect is a big one too.\n\nIf it were fully legalized, it could be like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked openly. That might lead to more people smoking and driving. Plus, marijuana is still seen as taboo in many places and contexts. Seeing it out in the open like that could feel awkward for some people.\n\nAlcohol probably has more immediate negative effects on motor skills, but for a lot of people, marijuana has a bigger impact on their lifestyle overall. Both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle moderation, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize because people react so differently to substances.",
            "I'd say, yeah, there are good and bad things about being Catholic.  They've got a lot of traditions they've stuck with for ages, and that can be nice.  It's comforting to have those roots. But, sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't adapt well to change.  Like, a lot of Catholics feel they *have* to go to church every week, and there are strict rules about everything. And, honestly, it feels like they judge people pretty harshly if they don't follow the rules perfectly. \n\nThey don't seem very accepting of people who aren't exactly like them, either.  For example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Isn't that supposed to be a loving religion?  It seems hypocritical to preach love but then turn around and reject people because they don't fit in.\n\nIt's like, they tell you to love everyone, but their actions don't always match those words.  They cling to old rules even though they don't seem to make sense in the modern world.\n\nNow, about priests getting married... I think it'd be good if they could.  But, I don't know if it would really stop the bad stuff that happens sometimes.  Those issues are way more complicated than just whether or not a priest is married. It's a sad thing that happens, and I don't think marriage would magically fix it.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this whole marriage equality issue. I honestly can't say if one side is right or wrong because it's such a complex problem. It's a real tightrope walk between separating church and state and figuring out what marriage truly means. \n\nIt's tough because defining marriage without upsetting anyone is nearly impossible. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining marriage at all, especially when it's seen as a religious sacrament.  Think about it – the government doesn't get involved in how people practice their religion, so why should they dictate who can get married? \n\nMaybe it's simpler to just see it as civil unions.  It's about two people committing to each other, regardless of their beliefs or sexual orientation. The government shouldn't care about the specifics of the ceremony, just that two people want to be together. \n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for a federal law. But, changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That just seems extreme. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for something like this, even if it's important to some people. It's not a big enough issue to warrant such a drastic change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I have lots of gay friends, so it's not a black-and-white issue. While I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a nationwide debate, though.  \n\nI think each state should decide for itself whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage.  Some states lean Democratic, and those are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that's okay with it, you're probably going to be fine with their decision. And honestly, if you choose to live somewhere, you kind of accept their views, right?\n\nI think everyone deserves equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. So, I feel strongly that the legality of gay marriage should be left up to the states.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush should have the power to ban gay marriage nationwide. It should be up to the individual states to decide what's best for them. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be making that kind of decision for everyone.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon.  If a Democratic president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth.  It's better to let each state make its own choice. After all, they're the ones who'll have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they're coming from. I mean, Myspace is basically like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see.  It doesn't matter if you're using your school's name or not, anyone can find it, even from their own homes.  \n\nI think the school officials were right to look at it. If it helps prevent something terrible like a school shooting, that's important. Protecting the students is the school's job, and if they had information about a potential threat, they had a responsibility to act.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a legitimate reason, like preventing harm, then I think it's okay.\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to say something bad about someone in an email because you never know who might read it.  Everything you put online can come back to haunt you later.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.  It's good to be able to express yourself online, but you have to be careful what you say. It's a public space, and anything you post can be seen by anyone, even the school.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was totally on board. Nine/Eleven hit me personally, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we were all just so emotional after that, we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and honestly, I think it backfired.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It feels like the people over there are so caught up in fighting each other that they'll always be at each other's throats, regardless of us being there.  \n\nIt's hard, because of Nine/Eleven, I've kind of just checked out. I don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like, they can't even get along with each other, how are they going to get better?  Sometimes I don't even think they're human, the way they fight.\n\nWe went in blind. We had no idea what we were facing. Their idea of war is so different from ours, they're just savage. I don't think they want to improve their country, they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave it alone. \n\nI think we were mostly just angry and fueled by revenge. We didn't think about the long-term consequences or how they'd react. President Bush, he probably felt pressured, like we had no choice but to declare war on Iraq after what happened.\n\nBut honestly, we should have had a better plan. We were all over the place, with no clear goals or unity. Maybe if we'd gone in with a clear strategy, things would have been different. I just feel like we were all so emotionally driven, and that's what we ended up creating over there. \n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're probably always going to be like this. I just don't know what else to say. This whole thing has dragged on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  \n\nI think no matter how long we stay, things will fall apart as soon as we leave. We can't be there forever, and I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to update some of its views. I've heard they're losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but their stance feels a bit outdated. If they were more open to modern thinking, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing people.  \n\nI've heard people are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these topics.  It's understandable that someone who supports abortion or gay marriage wouldn't feel comfortable in a community that condemns those things.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they couldn't have female priests or allow priests to get married. It seems unfair that they're expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else has a family life outside of work.",
            "Okay, so, I'm not against gay marriage. I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, sexuality isn't something you choose. So, I don't think we should blame people for how they are attracted to others. You know, it seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too hard, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right. It just doesn't seem like a choice, like how some people are born straight and others gay.  It's just how they are.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not really a legal or moral issue. It's just about people being who they are. It's not like they're making a bad choice or something.\n\nIt just feels wrong to make them feel like they're doing something wrong. They shouldn't be treated differently just because of who they love.  It's not like it affects anyone else's safety or anything. It's just their personal lives.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to legalize it. Some folks worry that gay couples threaten traditional families, but I think it's totally different. It's like two sides of the same coin – they're not the same, but they're connected. \n\nThere are also tons of civil rights issues tied to it. For example, if you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner might not be allowed to make medical decisions for you if you're sick, or even visit you in the hospital. It just doesn't seem right if you're planning to spend your life with someone.\n\nPlus, lots of studies show that gay relationships are just as successful as straight relationships. They have the same ingredients for a happy partnership.\n\nReally, it's about marriage certificates and legal rights, not church weddings. If the government keeps religion out of it, there shouldn't be a problem.\n\nIt's kind of like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about things like adoption and how a gay couple living in their community will affect everyone. They also wonder how children of gay couples will adjust.\n\nBut honestly, it's mostly new territory. Parenting skills are the same for everyone, whether they're gay or straight.\n\nI think the federal government should get involved and make same-sex marriage legal in all states.  President Bush seems to have really strong religious views against it, which might be linked to his stance on abortion and stem cell research.  \n\nBut I think it's important to remember that morality is different for everyone.  Just because some religious groups oppose gay marriage doesn't mean the government should enforce their beliefs on everyone. \n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological problem caused by childhood trauma or a personality flaw. But the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. \n\nWe should listen to experts and research instead of just believing what's popular or what our friends tell us.",
            "Okay, so I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've learned a thing or two.  Just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take drugs, for instance.  I mean, making them available to the public?  Absolutely not.  But using them for medical reasons?  Definitely yes.  It's all about the context.  \n\nThink about it: there are tons of legal drugs, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, that pharmacies use all the time. They're controlled substances, but they're super helpful.  If we're okay with those, why not consider marijuana for its potential benefits?\n\nIt's not exactly like alcohol, though. Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and so can marijuana. But I think we should approach marijuana differently.  Maybe a gradual legalization process would be better, step by step, so it doesn't get out of hand.  We need to ditch the stigma surrounding marijuana first.  Once people see it's not the scary monster everyone thinks it is, they might use it responsibly.\n\nHonestly, people have such a warped view of marijuana just because it's illegal. It's not like heroin or cocaine, you know?  If we get rid of that image, people could use it responsibly. And definitely for medical purposes!",
            "I think the church has modernized to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday in cute dresses, matching shoes and a purse.  I went to a private school and saw all my friends there on the weekends. Now, they have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long.  People dress much more casually, especially in the summer, coming straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up, people wear jeans and khakis. It's definitely more relaxed. That's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped these situations. Some married men become pedophiles too. It's a personal issue, not a matter of being able to marry or not. Priests choose to become priests, and if they want to be married while practicing their faith, maybe they should consider another religion. There are religions where priests can marry, like the one on the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  \n\nI think pedophilia is often genetic. It's something people are born with, not something they choose. Marriage wouldn't change that.  If the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's terrible. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they were going with the whole Iraq thing at first, but it was right after 9/11, and everyone was super shook up.  I think they used 9/11 as a way to justify going into Iraq, saying that Saddam Hussein had ties to Osama Bin Laden and weapons of mass destruction. Turns out, none of that was true, and that really rubs me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nHonestly, it feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people about everything. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, has said he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a huge betrayal of trust, something that should be impeachable.  It feels like they've just been disrespecting the Constitution ever since 9/11.  \n\nI have a feeling they went into office wanting to go to war.  I remember reading a book by the Treasury Secretary, who basically said that Bush Jr. had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's dealings with him. And on top of that, I think Bush Jr. was hoping to secure more energy resources for the U.S. through the war.  It all feels very manipulative.\n\nLook, I think it's gone on long enough.  Pulling out right now would probably cause a civil war and more deaths, though.  They're trying this thing with a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's going to create problems with Iraq's sovereignty in the long run.\n\nWith the news I've seen, the Parliament doesn't seem to be doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really have any control.  Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has a bunch of seats in Parliament. There are still so many radical groups fighting for power, and it's creating a lot of tension.",
            "Ugh, the War in Iraq... it's a mess. I mean, it's not even officially a war, which is kinda weird. It feels like it was all about revenge for 9/11, like we just wanted to hit back at whoever we thought did it.  I don't really follow the details, but it seems like we're just stuck there now, trying to build a democracy and get our hands on some oil. But honestly, it's just making everyone angry.  \n\nTrying to force democracy on them is taking forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad because they feel like we messed everything up. It's a lose-lose situation.  \n\nI don't know, it's a hard topic. It feels like we're using our military power to show off, like we're bigger and better. But it doesn't feel right.  We didn't even officially declare war, and now it's dragging on and on. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation where everything feels pointless.\n\nPlus, there are so many families with loved ones over there. I want them to come home safe, but it also feels wrong to stay and change their culture. It's a whole mess. I think this thing is going to keep going for years and years.",
            "Listen, I really don't think it's right for the government to make laws about this.  The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any kind of control over religious practices goes against that.  It feels like picking sides, favoring one church's beliefs over another.  For example, most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in some areas like Boston.  I just don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of what allows for religious freedom in the US. Even though there's talk about making an amendment, I think that's completely wrong.  It would go against what's already in the Constitution and would be one of the few amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, should get involved. It seems like this push for an amendment is just based on personal beliefs, specifically the president's Catholic views. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all others.  This decision should be left up to the churches themselves.  There's no real reason for a government amendment beyond personal opinions. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else, and it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the Iraq War...  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading Iraq, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They played on people's emotions after 9/11 and used that outrage to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq War feels a lot like a repeat of Vietnam. We should have learned from our past mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible.  \n\nThe US removed Iraq's government, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that would follow. They were trying to install a democracy, similar to what happened in Vietnam, where we tried to push out communists and promote democracy. But the US government should have known that wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and there's no guarantee of a clear victory.\n\nIn both Vietnam and Iraq, there were always going to be insurgents, even if some people supported the US intervention. It's hard to fight a war against your own citizens. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for any of this. They should have planned for all possible outcomes before going to war.  We're still there in 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, but it's a slow process.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war would be quick and successful, but it's far from it.  It takes time to build a new government and a stable society, as we saw in our own country's history.\n\nSo, the war in Iraq is a tough situation. We've been there for so long, it's hard to just walk away. But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice? \n\nIt also makes you wonder why we're only focused on Iraq. Why not other countries with problems, like North Korea? I think the oil issue plays a big part. We need to ask ourselves if this is really about freedom and democracy, or if it's about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. Yet, we aren't doing anything about North Korea, which we know has these weapons.  \n\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure that's going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been.  I just think it's a personal preference, something that's becoming more and more clear is biological, not sociological. It doesn't make sense to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong to me. I've always supported gay marriage. \n\nAnd honestly, politics and government shouldn't be involved. It's not a state or national issue; it's about personal relationships and families. Like, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family though — walk their dogs, hang out, you know?  It's frustrating that Bush is trying to define marriage in his own way. It just seems ridiculous.\n\nThere's so much research now showing that being gay might be biological, a chemical thing in the brain, not something you choose. It's like being predisposed to something, not a result of your upbringing.\n\nBesides the obvious, it feels like marriage is different for gay couples.  A straight couple can just elope to Vegas if they want, but a gay couple wanting to get married makes headlines.  It shouldn't be such a big deal. It's a private matter, not something that needs to be public.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal: anything you post online becomes public knowledge.  It's out there for everyone to see. As an RA, I've had to deal with this firsthand.  Whatever you put on the internet  shapes how people perceive you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone is going to take notice. You can't just put that kind of stuff out into the world. The internet is global; if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nThe school didn't magically receive a bulletin; someone went to them with this information. They have to act on these kinds of threats because, imagine if something happened, and they could have prevented it. \n\nBut it's a tricky situation because you don't always know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a harmless joke gone wrong, like a sociology class experiment, or it could be something truly dangerous.  \n\nIn our school's case, someone overheard a conversation, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked at the student's Facebook page because some things he posted, while maybe intended as a joke, became very concerning in light of the situation.\n\nThe bottom line is, when you share things online, there's no real expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret things or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on social media and snooping through their profiles.  It's a violation of privacy.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has dragged on way too long. At the beginning, the intention seemed good – to bring democracy to a country lacking fair political systems. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now it feels like we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. \n\nHonestly, I have doubts about the initial motives too. There were those past conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein that might have played a role.\n\nIf the goal was to help a country oppressed by a dictator achieve democracy, that would be a justifiable reason. But if personal vendettas were involved, that wouldn't be right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on far too long. We made our point in the initial months, demonstrating our military strength. But years later, it just feels excessive.\n\nI believe our original purpose has become muddled and distorted. It seems like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing a decisive victory, instead of for a clear, achievable goal.\n\nIt's time to end this war. Their government and officials need to take responsibility for their own country. We've already drained our economy, spending billions on a conflict that's lost its meaning.\n\nWe have pressing issues at home – poverty, inadequate infrastructure, healthcare – that deserve our attention and funding. Spending billions on a prolonged war that has lost its purpose is draining our resources from these critical areas. \n\nWe need to stop this war and invest in our own people and our own future.",
            "Can I ask something to make sure I understand? It sounds like this situation was stopped because someone saw something online, right?\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nHonestly, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.  On sites like Myspace, if you put information out there, it's basically public knowledge. I get that on Myspace you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you accept someone as a friend, you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nSo, if you post something online, you should know that lots of people might see it. If I think that in this case, someone seeing that information online and preventing a tragedy was a good thing.\n\nThat's a tough one though.  I mean, you can't have one person constantly checking everyone's profiles at school to prevent something bad from happening. But then, if they start focusing on \"bad kids\" and looking at their profiles, that feels like discrimination.\n\nI don't think it would be fair to have someone's job be to monitor people's profiles all day.  But maybe it depends on the situation. Were they looking for evidence of something specific, or were they just randomly browsing? It's hard to say.\n\n\nI don't personally have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook. It does worry me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw a news story once about a guy who could easily find people's information online. He got a girl's screen name from her profile and started talking to her on instant messenger. He managed to get her to meet him in less than a minute. \n\nPersonally, I would never do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their screen names. They know it's me, though. It's strange because they seem to know a lot about me - my interests, what I look like, even my class schedule and who my friends are. They can see all sorts of photos too. I try to be careful about what I post, but at the same time, Facebook is supposed to be a way to connect with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me. I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I'm not sure how the school has the right to tell students they can't use Myspace.",
            "Hmm, you know, talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical. I hate to jump on the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the start, but I was.  It's not really a big deal anymore though, because everyone pretty much agrees it was a bad idea except for those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nLook at the polls - they've done them everywhere, in the US, Iraq, even globally, and  it's pretty clear: 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad call. Eighty percent of Iraqis feel the same way, and even 70% of US troops over there think we should pull out within a year.  \n\nHonestly, it's been a mess from day one.  It was a disaster before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another disaster.  \n\nThere's just no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. It's a clash of cultures - the US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and previous ones, think they can just force democracy on a region where it doesn't fit. It's just not how those people want to live.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a complete disaster.  It's like quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons. \n\nIf they want to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that. But I just don't see why we shouldn't leave now. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better.\n\nAt least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then it's not on us if things go wrong. We can say, \"We were going to stay, but you guys made the decision to leave.\"\n\nMaybe that would make us the \"good guys\" - not really, no, never truly. But it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, I definitely think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. \n\nAnd it's not just about women. I think it depends on the specific field you're in. \n\nFor women, overall, I feel like they face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to exist, a lot of people still struggle to accept having a woman in a leadership position, especially if it's over a man. This is because of how society has been for so long.\n\nWomen often hit a point where they're qualified for a promotion, but the board might not choose them because of the historical stereotype that women aren't usually in leadership roles. \n\nIt's similar for men too, though. Think about things like the fashion industry or staying at home as a parent. \n\nIt's uncommon for a man to stay at home while the woman works. People sometimes judge that because society expects men to be the primary earners. But maybe the husband wants to be with the kids, and the wife has the better job. It can be really hard for them because society doesn't see it as the \"normal\" arrangement.\n\nAnd in fashion, straight men can sometimes struggle to be taken seriously.  It might sound weird, but it's probably because people associate fashion with women. If a man has a \"typical\" lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might wonder if he really understands women's fashion. \n\nBasically, I think gender discrimination exists in different ways depending on your field.\n\nChanging it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change takes time.  \n\nThe good news is, we're seeing progress. More women are becoming CEOs and being accepted in the business world. We're also seeing more stay-at-home dads being accepted because people are realizing that sometimes it works better that way. \n\nIt's all about showing the positive qualities of people who are stereotyped. If you force things, people resist. \n\nWe're at a good point now where things are slowly changing, but it takes time.",
            "They didn't actually legalize marijuana; they decriminalized it.  That means it's not a criminal offense anymore, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited instead of arrested and booked.  I think that if someone gets caught with it and gets cited, it can still have consequences for things like job interviews. Those kinds of negative impacts are usually the worst part of having a drug charge.  Even with decriminalization, people worry about those future repercussions.  \n\nBut on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest, book, and house people, plus court costs, public defenders, and the state attorney’s office. All that adds up. So when cities are struggling financially, some aren't willing to make that change, even if it would free up money for things like public education, social programs, and food assistance. Some communities just strongly oppose marijuana and don't want to decriminalize it.  \n\nPlaces like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, might be fine with it because it frees up resources. I think it's important because marijuana shouldn't just be readily available everywhere. There are lots of reasons for that, but the financial aspect is a big one too.\n\nIf it were fully legalized, it could be like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked openly. That might lead to more people smoking and driving. Plus, marijuana is still seen as taboo in many places and contexts. Seeing it out in the open like that could feel awkward for some people.\n\nAlcohol probably has more immediate negative effects on motor skills, but for a lot of people, marijuana has a bigger impact on their lifestyle overall. Both have their downsides, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle moderation, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize because people react so differently to substances.",
            "I'd say, yeah, there are good and bad things about being Catholic.  They've got a lot of traditions they've stuck with for ages, and that can be nice.  It's comforting to have those roots. But, sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't adapt well to change.  Like, a lot of Catholics feel they *have* to go to church every week, and there are strict rules about everything. And, honestly, it feels like they judge people pretty harshly if they don't follow the rules perfectly. \n\nThey don't seem very accepting of people who aren't exactly like them, either.  For example, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Isn't that supposed to be a loving religion?  It seems hypocritical to preach love but then turn around and reject people because they don't fit in.\n\nIt's like, they tell you to love everyone, but their actions don't always match those words.  They cling to old rules even though they don't seem to make sense in the modern world.\n\nNow, about priests getting married... I think it'd be good if they could.  But, I don't know if it would really stop the bad stuff that happens sometimes.  Those issues are way more complicated than just whether or not a priest is married. It's a sad thing that happens, and I don't think marriage would magically fix it.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this whole marriage equality issue. I honestly can't say if one side is right or wrong because it's such a complex problem. It's a real tightrope walk between separating church and state and figuring out what marriage truly means. \n\nIt's tough because defining marriage without upsetting anyone is nearly impossible. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining marriage at all, especially when it's seen as a religious sacrament.  Think about it – the government doesn't get involved in how people practice their religion, so why should they dictate who can get married? \n\nMaybe it's simpler to just see it as civil unions.  It's about two people committing to each other, regardless of their beliefs or sexual orientation. The government shouldn't care about the specifics of the ceremony, just that two people want to be together. \n\nIf all the states could agree on a fair solution, they should push for a federal law. But, changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That just seems extreme. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for something like this, even if it's important to some people. It's not a big enough issue to warrant such a drastic change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I have lots of gay friends, so it's not a black-and-white issue. While I personally don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legal. I don't think it should be a nationwide debate, though.  \n\nI think each state should decide for itself whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage.  Some states lean Democratic, and those are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that's okay with it, you're probably going to be fine with their decision. And honestly, if you choose to live somewhere, you kind of accept their views, right?\n\nI think everyone deserves equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. So, I feel strongly that the legality of gay marriage should be left up to the states.\n\nThat said, I don't think President Bush should have the power to ban gay marriage nationwide. It should be up to the individual states to decide what's best for them. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be making that kind of decision for everyone.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon.  If a Democratic president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth.  It's better to let each state make its own choice. After all, they're the ones who'll have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, I get where they're coming from. I mean, Myspace is basically like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see.  It doesn't matter if you're using your school's name or not, anyone can find it, even from their own homes.  \n\nI think the school officials were right to look at it. If it helps prevent something terrible like a school shooting, that's important. Protecting the students is the school's job, and if they had information about a potential threat, they had a responsibility to act.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a legitimate reason, like preventing harm, then I think it's okay.\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to say something bad about someone in an email because you never know who might read it.  Everything you put online can come back to haunt you later.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.  It's good to be able to express yourself online, but you have to be careful what you say. It's a public space, and anything you post can be seen by anyone, even the school.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... At first, I was totally on board. Nine/Eleven hit me personally, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. But looking back, I think we were all just so emotional after that, we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a solid plan, and honestly, I think it backfired.\n\nI used to be all for it, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It feels like the people over there are so caught up in fighting each other that they'll always be at each other's throats, regardless of us being there.  \n\nIt's hard, because of Nine/Eleven, I've kind of just checked out. I don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like, they can't even get along with each other, how are they going to get better?  Sometimes I don't even think they're human, the way they fight.\n\nWe went in blind. We had no idea what we were facing. Their idea of war is so different from ours, they're just savage. I don't think they want to improve their country, they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave it alone. \n\nI think we were mostly just angry and fueled by revenge. We didn't think about the long-term consequences or how they'd react. President Bush, he probably felt pressured, like we had no choice but to declare war on Iraq after what happened.\n\nBut honestly, we should have had a better plan. We were all over the place, with no clear goals or unity. Maybe if we'd gone in with a clear strategy, things would have been different. I just feel like we were all so emotionally driven, and that's what we ended up creating over there. \n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're probably always going to be like this. I just don't know what else to say. This whole thing has dragged on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  \n\nI think no matter how long we stay, things will fall apart as soon as we leave. We can't be there forever, and I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying."
