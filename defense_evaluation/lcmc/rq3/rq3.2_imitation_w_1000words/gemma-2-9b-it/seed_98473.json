            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. Lately, I've heard they're losing members, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things.  \n\nTake things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these issues, which is fine, but some of those views seem pretty outdated. If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing followers.\n\nPeople are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics.  They see it as a negative thing, like if you believe in abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it.  Same with gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be in a group that opposes it.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a family and a job; why not priests?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage.  I think that whether someone is born that way or not, it's not a choice they make.  So, I feel like gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are attracted to. It doesn't seem fair to me that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  Honestly, I haven't thought about it too much, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\n\nI guess it's like this: I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay.  It doesn't feel like a choice either way. So, why should someone be held accountable for something they can't control? It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this. It's not a legal issue or really even a moral one.  I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal or treated like they made a bad decision.  \n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in this. It doesn't affect national security or morals. It just seems like they're overstepping boundaries.  People should be able to live their lives as they choose, and that includes who they love. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some people worry that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but that just doesn't make sense. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing just because they're both sides of a coin. They're different, but both valid.  \n\nThere are lots of civil rights tied to marriage, too. For example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be able to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's kind of unfair if you're committed to someone for life.\n\nPlus, research shows that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship dynamics as straight couples. It's just a relationship, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat gets people hung up is the idea of churches and religion. But gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're asking for a legal document from the government. If the government doesn't get involved in religious matters, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else. Some people worry about adoption and how it will affect children, but studies haven't shown any negative impacts. The biggest problem kids of same-sex couples face is bullying and prejudice from others.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely make gay marriage legal nationwide. It's a matter of equality and basic human rights. President Bush, however, seems to have strong religious beliefs that influence his stance on gay marriage, which aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. \n\nHis reasoning often comes down to morality, but morality is subjective and varies widely. It's not fair to impose the religious beliefs of one group on the entire country. Plus, it's hypocritical to oppose \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance while supporting laws based on religious beliefs.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or a result of childhood trauma.  But that's simply not true, according to the American Psychological Association. We need to base our views on facts and research, not on prejudice and misinformation.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take marijuana, for example.  I think it should be legal for medicinal purposes because its potential benefits shouldn't be ignored just because of its legal status.  It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nThink about it, pharmacies use lots of controlled substances like oxycontin, Vicodin, and Percocet all the time. They're helpful, right?  But there's this stigma around marijuana that makes people forget it could have similar benefits.\n\nAlcohol is different, though.  Both alcohol and marijuana can be abused, but I think we should focus on removing the taboo around marijuana first.  Maybe then people would use it more responsibly.\n\nHonestly, the way people view marijuana is totally unfair.  It's not nearly as dangerous as other drugs, so if we changed people's perceptions, they might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed and adapted to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be.  When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. That was the norm back then. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there every weekend.\n\nNow, things are different. They have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. You'll see families rushing in from the beach straight to church. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of the formal attire I wore before. It's definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing women priests or permitting priests to marry would have stopped those horrible acts.  There are married men who become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.  \n\nIf someone truly wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion, like some of the ones where ministers or reverends are allowed to marry. \n\nI think pedophilia has roots in genetics. It's something people are born with, not something they become.  You can't hide it through marriage. It might come out eventually. The church may have failed to address the issue properly in some cases, but I don't believe they could have prevented it altogether.",
            "Man, you know, at first I was cool with the idea of the Iraq War, but everyone was still super shook up from 9/11. It felt like we rushed into it, using it as an excuse.  I mean, the Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, and we all know that turned out to be a big fat lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush team straight-up lied to the American people, and they still haven't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that huge speech at the UN, now says he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong, plain and simple. It's like, how can you lie to the country like that? That's gotta be grounds for impeachment! And it's not just that; it feels like the Bush administration has been trying to push the Constitution aside ever since 9/11.\n\nIt seems like they came into office wanting to go to war. I can't remember the name of the Treasury Secretary who said this, but he wrote about it in his book after he got pushed out. It sounds like the younger Bush had some personal beef with Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. It's all pretty sneaky if you ask me.\n\nI think it's gone on long enough, though. If we pulled out right now, things could get really messy and even more people could die. It seems like the UN and the US are trying to get countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help set things right. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause more problems in the long run because it messes with Iraq's sovereignty. \n\nThe government is falling apart. The news says the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in charge. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has seats in Parliament!  We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for control, and it's creating a lot of chaos.",
            "I'm not sure how to put this into words.  It feels like a pointless war, you know? I mean, it wasn't even officially declared. It just feels like we invaded Iraq because we thought they were behind 9/11.  Honestly, I don't really follow the news about it closely. I don't know all the details.\n\nBut, from what I gather, we're still there trying to build democracy and get access to their oil.  The problem is, it's creating a lot of anger. Staying there forever to build a democracy will take ages, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up.\n\nIt's a real dilemma.  It makes me wonder if we should even call it a war anymore. We never actually declared it. It seems like we're just showing off our military power and trying to make ourselves look big.\n\nPart of me feels like we should stay and help them, but it's also costing us so much, and it's making President Bush look bad. I worry he'll become known as the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nThen there are the families with loved ones in Iraq. I hate to say it, but I want the war to end for them, but I also don't want us to just abandon the people of Iraq. They've lost so much.\n\nI feel like if we stay, we'll try to make them more like us, which could backfire. It might make things worse and fuel more hatred towards America. \n\nThis whole situation feels like it's going to drag on forever. Ugh, it's just so complicated.",
            "You know, I don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or for any state to even try to say it's okay.  It just seems like something the churches should decide for themselves. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and it seems to me that trying to control or influence this issue goes against what's already been established.\n\nI think people pushing to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe in some areas like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can or can't do.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution and something that allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even though there have been talks about making an amendment,  I think adding one about this would be completely wrong and go against what's already written. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that's actually used to restrict people instead of the government, which doesn't seem right.\n\nI firmly believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, shouldn't be involved in this. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's based on their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're just trying to favor one religion over all others.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't really a good reason to support this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else in a negative way. In fact, it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I really don't think the government was completely honest with us about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used our fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.  Personally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes.\n\nThis Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and we should have learned from our mistakes there.  A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and just removed the Iraqi government without really thinking about what would happen next. They didn't plan for the chaos, the power vacuum, and all the fallout. The US is trying to install a democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but pushing out Communists and trying to force democracy on a country is never easy. It's a long and difficult process, and we should have known that going in.\n\nIt wasn't a clear-cut victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss, because no matter how many people support you, there will always be insurgents. You can't defeat a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to, we needed to be prepared for everything. We weren't ready for the aftermath, for what would happen once they took out Saddam Hussein.\n\nWe're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a long process.  \n\nThe government kind of misled the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission. But implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history! It took a long struggle to get to the strong democracy we have today.\n\nSo, what do we do now? It's a tough decision. We can't just abandon Iraq now after everything we've done. But how many more lives are we willing to lose for a free and democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be honest, why just Iraq? Why not other countries? I think the oil is a big factor. We need that oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any. But North Korea has those weapons, and we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough.\n\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there, but I'm not very optimistic.",
            "I'm a big supporter of gay marriage, always have been.  It's a personal choice, and research shows it could even be biological rather than social.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control.  I think it's unfair and inhumane.  I've always been an advocate for equal rights for everyone, including gay couples.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal matter, something between two people and their families.  In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and being part of the community.  \n\nIt seems like President Bush is trying to play God by interpreting marriage in his own way. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from lots of sources that being gay might be a biological thing, something you're predisposed to. It's not a choice you make based on your upbringing or environment.  \n\nBesides the obvious, I think it's unfair that a couple can just run off and get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal. It should be a private matter, something between the couple and their family, not something that's splashed all over the news.  It shouldn't be a national issue.",
            "So, basically, when you put something on the internet, it's out there for everyone to see.  It's like a public space. As an RA, I've dealt with this before.  Once you post something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you're talking about causing harm, like explosions or shootings, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their posts.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if it's the school that got the alert, someone saw it and reported it. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just people messing around. Maybe it was a social experiment that went wrong, like for a sociology class. \n\nOr maybe it was something really serious. In this case, something happened at school, someone overheard a conversation, and they reported it. When they looked through the person's Facebook, they found things that were concerning, even if the person meant them as a joke. In the end, the internet doesn't offer much privacy. If you don't want people to see something, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it.\n\nIt's not okay for school officials to be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy because the person shared it with others. If there's a potential danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI think schools should focus on what's brought to their attention directly, not on monitoring phone calls, texts, or IMs.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on far too long. At the start, the goal seemed good—to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power, not for any real reason.  \n\nPlus, I wonder if the motives were ever truly pure. There were definitely connections to personal grudges between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to help establish democracy, that would be a noble cause. But if personal matters were involved, then it's not right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on way too long. We made our point in the beginning, but hanging on for years just isn't necessary. Their government and people need to figure things out on their own.\n\nIt's draining our economy. We're spending billions on a war that seems to have lost its purpose, while neglecting our own problems like poverty, failing infrastructure, and inadequate healthcare. That money could be better used to help our own citizens.  \n\nIt's just not right to keep pouring resources into a war that seems endless. We need to bring our troops home and focus on solving the issues we have right here at home.",
            "So, someone was asking if it was okay for someone to look at people's Myspace profiles to prevent something bad from happening.  I think it's pretty much fair game if you post something online, especially on a site like Myspace where you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. If you're friends with someone, you're giving them permission to see what you post.  \n\nIt's tough though, because you can't have someone constantly checking everyone's profiles. It would be like singling out certain kids as \"bad\" and targeting them. It's a tricky situation. Maybe it depends on the situation. If someone sees something specific that raises a red flag, then it might be justified. \n\nI personally have a Facebook, and it's unsettling knowing that anyone could see my information. I once saw a news story about a guy who easily found someone's information from their profile and started chatting with them. It's scary how much information is out there.  \n\nI try to be careful about what I share online, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a balancing act. \n\nI also heard that some high schools actually banned Myspace.  It seems strange to me that schools would have that kind of control over what their students do online.  It feels like a privacy issue.",
            "I feel awkward talking about the Iraq War, you know? It's hard not to feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon of people who were against it from the start.  But honestly, looking back, it's clear to me that it was a mistake.  Everyone seems to agree, except maybe for the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  There have been polls everywhere – in the U.S., Iraq, and globally – showing that 75 to 80% of people think the war was a bad idea.  Even a lot of the U.S. troops stationed there believe we should get out within the next year.\n\nIt feels like everything about the war has been a disaster, even before we even went in.  Pulling out is going to be a mess too, and there's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's a clash of cultures, and it seems like our government just doesn't understand that. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly.  You have to weigh the pros and cons carefully, and in this case, the cons far outweigh the pros.  It's like quicksand – once we went in, we got stuck.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason for us to stay there. The administration probably has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, and maybe there are some risks involved in leaving. But I haven't heard any convincing reasons why we shouldn't just go.\n\nIf they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have much of a problem with that. But the longer we stay, the worse it seems to get. I read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a lot of them want us to leave right now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nIf we ask them what they want, and they say they want us to leave, then at least we can say we gave them a choice. If things go bad after that, we can say we tried to do what was best, but they ultimately made the decision.  Maybe then we could at least be seen as the good guys, or at least less bad.",
            "Yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S. It's not just about women though. It's more about the specific field you're working in.  I mean, overall, women face tougher times because of that invisible \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is the goal, many people struggle to work for a woman in a leadership position, just because of how society's always been. So, often, women see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because traditionally, women haven't held top positions in business. And, I guess the same goes for men too.  \n\nThink about things like being a stay-at-home parent. It's super uncommon for a man to stay home while his wife works. People often judge them, assuming the man should be the breadwinner. It can be tough for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be at home with their kids, even if their wife has the higher-paying job.  But society doesn't get it.\n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Men who are into fashion, especially straight men, sometimes don't get taken seriously. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because people think guys who are into fashion have different lifestyles. So, if a guy fits the typical mold and he's in fashion, people might wonder, \"How can he really understand fashion if he's not more like us, the women?\"\n\nIt's like, depending on your field, there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, even though we've come a long way since the 1800s. Change is slow, but women are rising in business, becoming CEOs and getting more acceptance.  It's happening, and people are starting to get on board.\n\nThe same goes for stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the wife is the better earner, or maybe she just wants to work. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their wives or female friends and understanding where men are coming from.\n\nSo, we have to promote these stereotypes by showing off the good qualities of those who are usually looked down on, but not in a pushy way. You can't force change, or people will resist. We're in a good spot where things are starting to change naturally.  \n\nI don't think there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time, and we've already come a long way.  \n\nOh, and I think people discriminate against each other based on where they're from too. If a guy grew up on a farm and his grammar isn't perfect, but he's super smart and becomes a CEO, some men might make fun of him, saying things like, \"How can I trust you if you don't even speak correctly?\" You know?",
            "So, they didn't exactly make marijuana legal, they decriminalized it.  \n\nThink of it like this: instead of being a criminal offense, it's now more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited, but you don't get arrested, booked, or hauled into jail. \n\nThere are still some downsides though.  Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews might still be affected.  Those big, scary consequences of a drug charge, they don't always disappear.\n\nBut, on the other hand, getting caught with marijuana used to cost taxpayers a ton of money.  Think about it: arresting people, holding them in jail, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all adds up. \n\nPlaces that are struggling financially might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it saved them money. \n\nSome places, like Denver, are more open to the idea.  They might even use the money saved to fund things like education, social programs, and food assistance.  \n\nIt's important to remember that just because something is decriminalized doesn't mean it should be everywhere.  We need to be careful about how it's handled.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could end up like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it might just feel uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nI think alcohol actually has a bigger impact on your ability to drive safely, but marijuana can be more disruptive to someone's everyday life.  \n\nUltimately, every substance affects people differently.  Some people can handle it better than others.  It's tough to generalize.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do is pretty traditional. They've done things the same way for ages, and it's good to have those roots. But it's also important to be able to change with the times, you know?  \n\nA lot of Catholics think they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow every single rule perfectly.  They don't really accept people who aren't exactly \"ideal\" Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions either.  Like, for example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nIt doesn't seem very tolerant of other faiths to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic thing, but it feels hypocritical to say you love others and then not accept them the way they are.  So, a lot of Catholic teachings are about doing things a certain way, but then the way they actually practice goes against it because it's so stuck in the past.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests from abusing children. It's a whole different issue.  It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\n\nI mean, people who hurt children probably would do it whether or not they were married. It's about a power imbalance, not about being married or not. If someone is going to abuse a child, they're going to do it whether they have a spouse or not. I don't think letting priests get married would stop that from happening.",
            "I'm still figuring out my stance on this whole marriage equality debate. It's really tough, you know? It feels like it walks a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means.  It's hard not to offend anyone when you're trying to define something so personal. \n\nI'm leaning towards the idea that all unions, whether they're between two men, two women, or a man and a woman, should be treated as civil unions.  After all, the government doesn't get involved in religious ceremonies like baptism, right?  Why should marriage be any different?  It's about two people coming together, and that's what matters.\n\nI think it's important for the government to stay out of people's personal lives and not dictate who they can marry.  If all the states can agree on a reasonable solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law.  \n\nBut a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That seems extreme.  Changing the constitution shouldn't be taken lightly, especially for something like this. It's a big deal for some people, but I don't think it's important enough to warrant amending the constitution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe they should have the right to marry. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each individual state.\n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, while others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and people living there should be able to live in accordance with their state's values. If you choose to live in a state that legalizes it, you're essentially accepting that decision.\n\nBasically, I think everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities. So, I believe in leaving the decision of whether or not to legalize gay marriage up to each state. \n\nI don't think President Bush should have the power to ban it nationwide.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should govern itself. Plus, with a new president potentially coming in soon, it's likely to become a back-and-forth issue. It's best to let individual states make their own choices, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences.",
            "Look, I get it. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Whatever you post, anyone can see it. So if you're putting something on there, you kind of have to assume people are going to see it, even people like school officials. I mean, even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut when it comes to preventing something terrible like a school shooting, I think the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe. If they see something online that makes them think a student might be a danger, I think it's okay for them to look into it. \n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if it's about protecting kids, I think it's fine. \n\nThink about it: you wouldn't want to send your kid to a school where the staff wasn't doing everything they could to keep them safe, right? \n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to put anything nasty about someone in an email because you never know who might see it later.  Everything online can come back to bite you. \n\nSo, yeah, I think the school officials were justified in looking at the Myspace page. They were just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... at first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted revenge, you know? But looking back, I think we went in too emotionally.  We didn't really plan things out, and now I think it backfired.\n\nI don't think being there is helping. It seems like they're just fighting amongst themselves anyway, and we're caught in the middle.  Honestly, because of 9/11, I've kind of checked out. I don't care what happens over there anymore.\n\nIt's frustrating. They're so different from us when it comes to war. It's savage. They don't want to make their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were more angry than anything when we went in.  We wanted revenge, and I think President Bush let that dictate his actions.  But I get it, we couldn't just ignore what happened.\n\nI just wish we had a better plan. We didn't know what we were walking into, and I don't think we had a clear goal. There wasn't any unity. \n\nWe made some progress, but it's not enough.  We can't stay forever, and I honestly think things will just fall apart once we leave. We're hurting ourselves by staying there."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. Lately, I've heard they're losing members, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things.  \n\nTake things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these issues, which is fine, but some of those views seem pretty outdated. If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing followers.\n\nPeople are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics.  They see it as a negative thing, like if you believe in abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it.  Same with gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be in a group that opposes it.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a family and a job; why not priests?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage.  I think that whether someone is born that way or not, it's not a choice they make.  So, I feel like gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are attracted to. It doesn't seem fair to me that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  Honestly, I haven't thought about it too much, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\n\nI guess it's like this: I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay.  It doesn't feel like a choice either way. So, why should someone be held accountable for something they can't control? It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this. It's not a legal issue or really even a moral one.  I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal or treated like they made a bad decision.  \n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in this. It doesn't affect national security or morals. It just seems like they're overstepping boundaries.  People should be able to live their lives as they choose, and that includes who they love. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some people worry that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but that just doesn't make sense. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing just because they're both sides of a coin. They're different, but both valid.  \n\nThere are lots of civil rights tied to marriage, too. For example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be able to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's kind of unfair if you're committed to someone for life.\n\nPlus, research shows that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship dynamics as straight couples. It's just a relationship, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat gets people hung up is the idea of churches and religion. But gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're asking for a legal document from the government. If the government doesn't get involved in religious matters, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else. Some people worry about adoption and how it will affect children, but studies haven't shown any negative impacts. The biggest problem kids of same-sex couples face is bullying and prejudice from others.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely make gay marriage legal nationwide. It's a matter of equality and basic human rights. President Bush, however, seems to have strong religious beliefs that influence his stance on gay marriage, which aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. \n\nHis reasoning often comes down to morality, but morality is subjective and varies widely. It's not fair to impose the religious beliefs of one group on the entire country. Plus, it's hypocritical to oppose \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance while supporting laws based on religious beliefs.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or a result of childhood trauma.  But that's simply not true, according to the American Psychological Association. We need to base our views on facts and research, not on prejudice and misinformation.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take marijuana, for example.  I think it should be legal for medicinal purposes because its potential benefits shouldn't be ignored just because of its legal status.  It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nThink about it, pharmacies use lots of controlled substances like oxycontin, Vicodin, and Percocet all the time. They're helpful, right?  But there's this stigma around marijuana that makes people forget it could have similar benefits.\n\nAlcohol is different, though.  Both alcohol and marijuana can be abused, but I think we should focus on removing the taboo around marijuana first.  Maybe then people would use it more responsibly.\n\nHonestly, the way people view marijuana is totally unfair.  It's not nearly as dangerous as other drugs, so if we changed people's perceptions, they might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed and adapted to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be.  When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. That was the norm back then. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there every weekend.\n\nNow, things are different. They have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. You'll see families rushing in from the beach straight to church. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of the formal attire I wore before. It's definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing women priests or permitting priests to marry would have stopped those horrible acts.  There are married men who become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.  \n\nIf someone truly wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion, like some of the ones where ministers or reverends are allowed to marry. \n\nI think pedophilia has roots in genetics. It's something people are born with, not something they become.  You can't hide it through marriage. It might come out eventually. The church may have failed to address the issue properly in some cases, but I don't believe they could have prevented it altogether.",
            "Man, you know, at first I was cool with the idea of the Iraq War, but everyone was still super shook up from 9/11. It felt like we rushed into it, using it as an excuse.  I mean, the Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, and we all know that turned out to be a big fat lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush team straight-up lied to the American people, and they still haven't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that huge speech at the UN, now says he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong, plain and simple. It's like, how can you lie to the country like that? That's gotta be grounds for impeachment! And it's not just that; it feels like the Bush administration has been trying to push the Constitution aside ever since 9/11.\n\nIt seems like they came into office wanting to go to war. I can't remember the name of the Treasury Secretary who said this, but he wrote about it in his book after he got pushed out. It sounds like the younger Bush had some personal beef with Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. It's all pretty sneaky if you ask me.\n\nI think it's gone on long enough, though. If we pulled out right now, things could get really messy and even more people could die. It seems like the UN and the US are trying to get countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help set things right. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause more problems in the long run because it messes with Iraq's sovereignty. \n\nThe government is falling apart. The news says the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in charge. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has seats in Parliament!  We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for control, and it's creating a lot of chaos.",
            "I'm not sure how to put this into words.  It feels like a pointless war, you know? I mean, it wasn't even officially declared. It just feels like we invaded Iraq because we thought they were behind 9/11.  Honestly, I don't really follow the news about it closely. I don't know all the details.\n\nBut, from what I gather, we're still there trying to build democracy and get access to their oil.  The problem is, it's creating a lot of anger. Staying there forever to build a democracy will take ages, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up.\n\nIt's a real dilemma.  It makes me wonder if we should even call it a war anymore. We never actually declared it. It seems like we're just showing off our military power and trying to make ourselves look big.\n\nPart of me feels like we should stay and help them, but it's also costing us so much, and it's making President Bush look bad. I worry he'll become known as the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nThen there are the families with loved ones in Iraq. I hate to say it, but I want the war to end for them, but I also don't want us to just abandon the people of Iraq. They've lost so much.\n\nI feel like if we stay, we'll try to make them more like us, which could backfire. It might make things worse and fuel more hatred towards America. \n\nThis whole situation feels like it's going to drag on forever. Ugh, it's just so complicated.",
            "You know, I don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or for any state to even try to say it's okay.  It just seems like something the churches should decide for themselves. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and it seems to me that trying to control or influence this issue goes against what's already been established.\n\nI think people pushing to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe in some areas like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can or can't do.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution and something that allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even though there have been talks about making an amendment,  I think adding one about this would be completely wrong and go against what's already written. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that's actually used to restrict people instead of the government, which doesn't seem right.\n\nI firmly believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, shouldn't be involved in this. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's based on their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're just trying to favor one religion over all others.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't really a good reason to support this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else in a negative way. In fact, it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I really don't think the government was completely honest with us about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used our fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.  Personally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes.\n\nThis Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and we should have learned from our mistakes there.  A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and just removed the Iraqi government without really thinking about what would happen next. They didn't plan for the chaos, the power vacuum, and all the fallout. The US is trying to install a democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but pushing out Communists and trying to force democracy on a country is never easy. It's a long and difficult process, and we should have known that going in.\n\nIt wasn't a clear-cut victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss, because no matter how many people support you, there will always be insurgents. You can't defeat a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to, we needed to be prepared for everything. We weren't ready for the aftermath, for what would happen once they took out Saddam Hussein.\n\nWe're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a long process.  \n\nThe government kind of misled the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission. But implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history! It took a long struggle to get to the strong democracy we have today.\n\nSo, what do we do now? It's a tough decision. We can't just abandon Iraq now after everything we've done. But how many more lives are we willing to lose for a free and democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be honest, why just Iraq? Why not other countries? I think the oil is a big factor. We need that oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any. But North Korea has those weapons, and we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough.\n\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there, but I'm not very optimistic.",
            "I'm a big supporter of gay marriage, always have been.  It's a personal choice, and research shows it could even be biological rather than social.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control.  I think it's unfair and inhumane.  I've always been an advocate for equal rights for everyone, including gay couples.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal matter, something between two people and their families.  In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and being part of the community.  \n\nIt seems like President Bush is trying to play God by interpreting marriage in his own way. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from lots of sources that being gay might be a biological thing, something you're predisposed to. It's not a choice you make based on your upbringing or environment.  \n\nBesides the obvious, I think it's unfair that a couple can just run off and get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal. It should be a private matter, something between the couple and their family, not something that's splashed all over the news.  It shouldn't be a national issue.",
            "So, basically, when you put something on the internet, it's out there for everyone to see.  It's like a public space. As an RA, I've dealt with this before.  Once you post something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you're talking about causing harm, like explosions or shootings, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their posts.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if it's the school that got the alert, someone saw it and reported it. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just people messing around. Maybe it was a social experiment that went wrong, like for a sociology class. \n\nOr maybe it was something really serious. In this case, something happened at school, someone overheard a conversation, and they reported it. When they looked through the person's Facebook, they found things that were concerning, even if the person meant them as a joke. In the end, the internet doesn't offer much privacy. If you don't want people to see something, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it.\n\nIt's not okay for school officials to be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy because the person shared it with others. If there's a potential danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI think schools should focus on what's brought to their attention directly, not on monitoring phone calls, texts, or IMs.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on far too long. At the start, the goal seemed good—to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power, not for any real reason.  \n\nPlus, I wonder if the motives were ever truly pure. There were definitely connections to personal grudges between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to help establish democracy, that would be a noble cause. But if personal matters were involved, then it's not right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on way too long. We made our point in the beginning, but hanging on for years just isn't necessary. Their government and people need to figure things out on their own.\n\nIt's draining our economy. We're spending billions on a war that seems to have lost its purpose, while neglecting our own problems like poverty, failing infrastructure, and inadequate healthcare. That money could be better used to help our own citizens.  \n\nIt's just not right to keep pouring resources into a war that seems endless. We need to bring our troops home and focus on solving the issues we have right here at home.",
            "So, someone was asking if it was okay for someone to look at people's Myspace profiles to prevent something bad from happening.  I think it's pretty much fair game if you post something online, especially on a site like Myspace where you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. If you're friends with someone, you're giving them permission to see what you post.  \n\nIt's tough though, because you can't have someone constantly checking everyone's profiles. It would be like singling out certain kids as \"bad\" and targeting them. It's a tricky situation. Maybe it depends on the situation. If someone sees something specific that raises a red flag, then it might be justified. \n\nI personally have a Facebook, and it's unsettling knowing that anyone could see my information. I once saw a news story about a guy who easily found someone's information from their profile and started chatting with them. It's scary how much information is out there.  \n\nI try to be careful about what I share online, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a balancing act. \n\nI also heard that some high schools actually banned Myspace.  It seems strange to me that schools would have that kind of control over what their students do online.  It feels like a privacy issue.",
            "I feel awkward talking about the Iraq War, you know? It's hard not to feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon of people who were against it from the start.  But honestly, looking back, it's clear to me that it was a mistake.  Everyone seems to agree, except maybe for the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  There have been polls everywhere – in the U.S., Iraq, and globally – showing that 75 to 80% of people think the war was a bad idea.  Even a lot of the U.S. troops stationed there believe we should get out within the next year.\n\nIt feels like everything about the war has been a disaster, even before we even went in.  Pulling out is going to be a mess too, and there's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's a clash of cultures, and it seems like our government just doesn't understand that. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly.  You have to weigh the pros and cons carefully, and in this case, the cons far outweigh the pros.  It's like quicksand – once we went in, we got stuck.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason for us to stay there. The administration probably has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, and maybe there are some risks involved in leaving. But I haven't heard any convincing reasons why we shouldn't just go.\n\nIf they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have much of a problem with that. But the longer we stay, the worse it seems to get. I read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a lot of them want us to leave right now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nIf we ask them what they want, and they say they want us to leave, then at least we can say we gave them a choice. If things go bad after that, we can say we tried to do what was best, but they ultimately made the decision.  Maybe then we could at least be seen as the good guys, or at least less bad.",
            "Yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S. It's not just about women though. It's more about the specific field you're working in.  I mean, overall, women face tougher times because of that invisible \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is the goal, many people struggle to work for a woman in a leadership position, just because of how society's always been. So, often, women see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because traditionally, women haven't held top positions in business. And, I guess the same goes for men too.  \n\nThink about things like being a stay-at-home parent. It's super uncommon for a man to stay home while his wife works. People often judge them, assuming the man should be the breadwinner. It can be tough for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be at home with their kids, even if their wife has the higher-paying job.  But society doesn't get it.\n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Men who are into fashion, especially straight men, sometimes don't get taken seriously. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because people think guys who are into fashion have different lifestyles. So, if a guy fits the typical mold and he's in fashion, people might wonder, \"How can he really understand fashion if he's not more like us, the women?\"\n\nIt's like, depending on your field, there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, even though we've come a long way since the 1800s. Change is slow, but women are rising in business, becoming CEOs and getting more acceptance.  It's happening, and people are starting to get on board.\n\nThe same goes for stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the wife is the better earner, or maybe she just wants to work. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their wives or female friends and understanding where men are coming from.\n\nSo, we have to promote these stereotypes by showing off the good qualities of those who are usually looked down on, but not in a pushy way. You can't force change, or people will resist. We're in a good spot where things are starting to change naturally.  \n\nI don't think there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time, and we've already come a long way.  \n\nOh, and I think people discriminate against each other based on where they're from too. If a guy grew up on a farm and his grammar isn't perfect, but he's super smart and becomes a CEO, some men might make fun of him, saying things like, \"How can I trust you if you don't even speak correctly?\" You know?",
            "So, they didn't exactly make marijuana legal, they decriminalized it.  \n\nThink of it like this: instead of being a criminal offense, it's now more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited, but you don't get arrested, booked, or hauled into jail. \n\nThere are still some downsides though.  Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews might still be affected.  Those big, scary consequences of a drug charge, they don't always disappear.\n\nBut, on the other hand, getting caught with marijuana used to cost taxpayers a ton of money.  Think about it: arresting people, holding them in jail, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all adds up. \n\nPlaces that are struggling financially might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it saved them money. \n\nSome places, like Denver, are more open to the idea.  They might even use the money saved to fund things like education, social programs, and food assistance.  \n\nIt's important to remember that just because something is decriminalized doesn't mean it should be everywhere.  We need to be careful about how it's handled.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could end up like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it might just feel uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nI think alcohol actually has a bigger impact on your ability to drive safely, but marijuana can be more disruptive to someone's everyday life.  \n\nUltimately, every substance affects people differently.  Some people can handle it better than others.  It's tough to generalize.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do is pretty traditional. They've done things the same way for ages, and it's good to have those roots. But it's also important to be able to change with the times, you know?  \n\nA lot of Catholics think they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow every single rule perfectly.  They don't really accept people who aren't exactly \"ideal\" Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions either.  Like, for example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nIt doesn't seem very tolerant of other faiths to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic thing, but it feels hypocritical to say you love others and then not accept them the way they are.  So, a lot of Catholic teachings are about doing things a certain way, but then the way they actually practice goes against it because it's so stuck in the past.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests from abusing children. It's a whole different issue.  It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\n\nI mean, people who hurt children probably would do it whether or not they were married. It's about a power imbalance, not about being married or not. If someone is going to abuse a child, they're going to do it whether they have a spouse or not. I don't think letting priests get married would stop that from happening.",
            "I'm still figuring out my stance on this whole marriage equality debate. It's really tough, you know? It feels like it walks a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means.  It's hard not to offend anyone when you're trying to define something so personal. \n\nI'm leaning towards the idea that all unions, whether they're between two men, two women, or a man and a woman, should be treated as civil unions.  After all, the government doesn't get involved in religious ceremonies like baptism, right?  Why should marriage be any different?  It's about two people coming together, and that's what matters.\n\nI think it's important for the government to stay out of people's personal lives and not dictate who they can marry.  If all the states can agree on a reasonable solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law.  \n\nBut a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That seems extreme.  Changing the constitution shouldn't be taken lightly, especially for something like this. It's a big deal for some people, but I don't think it's important enough to warrant amending the constitution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe they should have the right to marry. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each individual state.\n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, while others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and people living there should be able to live in accordance with their state's values. If you choose to live in a state that legalizes it, you're essentially accepting that decision.\n\nBasically, I think everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities. So, I believe in leaving the decision of whether or not to legalize gay marriage up to each state. \n\nI don't think President Bush should have the power to ban it nationwide.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should govern itself. Plus, with a new president potentially coming in soon, it's likely to become a back-and-forth issue. It's best to let individual states make their own choices, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences.",
            "Look, I get it. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Whatever you post, anyone can see it. So if you're putting something on there, you kind of have to assume people are going to see it, even people like school officials. I mean, even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut when it comes to preventing something terrible like a school shooting, I think the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe. If they see something online that makes them think a student might be a danger, I think it's okay for them to look into it. \n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if it's about protecting kids, I think it's fine. \n\nThink about it: you wouldn't want to send your kid to a school where the staff wasn't doing everything they could to keep them safe, right? \n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to put anything nasty about someone in an email because you never know who might see it later.  Everything online can come back to bite you. \n\nSo, yeah, I think the school officials were justified in looking at the Myspace page. They were just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... at first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted revenge, you know? But looking back, I think we went in too emotionally.  We didn't really plan things out, and now I think it backfired.\n\nI don't think being there is helping. It seems like they're just fighting amongst themselves anyway, and we're caught in the middle.  Honestly, because of 9/11, I've kind of checked out. I don't care what happens over there anymore.\n\nIt's frustrating. They're so different from us when it comes to war. It's savage. They don't want to make their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were more angry than anything when we went in.  We wanted revenge, and I think President Bush let that dictate his actions.  But I get it, we couldn't just ignore what happened.\n\nI just wish we had a better plan. We didn't know what we were walking into, and I don't think we had a clear goal. There wasn't any unity. \n\nWe made some progress, but it's not enough.  We can't stay forever, and I honestly think things will just fall apart once we leave. We're hurting ourselves by staying there."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to modernize some of its views. Lately, I've heard they're losing members, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things.  \n\nTake things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these issues, which is fine, but some of those views seem pretty outdated. If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be worried about losing followers.\n\nPeople are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these topics.  They see it as a negative thing, like if you believe in abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it.  Same with gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be in a group that opposes it.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. I mean, everyone else gets to have a family and a job; why not priests?",
            "I'm not against gay marriage.  I think that whether someone is born that way or not, it's not a choice they make.  So, I feel like gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are attracted to. It doesn't seem fair to me that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  Honestly, I haven't thought about it too much, but I definitely think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\n\nI guess it's like this: I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay.  It doesn't feel like a choice either way. So, why should someone be held accountable for something they can't control? It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this. It's not a legal issue or really even a moral one.  I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal or treated like they made a bad decision.  \n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in this. It doesn't affect national security or morals. It just seems like they're overstepping boundaries.  People should be able to live their lives as they choose, and that includes who they love. It's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some people worry that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but that just doesn't make sense. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing just because they're both sides of a coin. They're different, but both valid.  \n\nThere are lots of civil rights tied to marriage, too. For example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be able to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's kind of unfair if you're committed to someone for life.\n\nPlus, research shows that gay couples have the same success rates and relationship dynamics as straight couples. It's just a relationship, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat gets people hung up is the idea of churches and religion. But gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're asking for a legal document from the government. If the government doesn't get involved in religious matters, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIt's like segregation – separate but unequal. Gay couples deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else. Some people worry about adoption and how it will affect children, but studies haven't shown any negative impacts. The biggest problem kids of same-sex couples face is bullying and prejudice from others.\n\nI think the federal government should definitely make gay marriage legal nationwide. It's a matter of equality and basic human rights. President Bush, however, seems to have strong religious beliefs that influence his stance on gay marriage, which aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. \n\nHis reasoning often comes down to morality, but morality is subjective and varies widely. It's not fair to impose the religious beliefs of one group on the entire country. Plus, it's hypocritical to oppose \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance while supporting laws based on religious beliefs.\n\nSome people believe being gay is a psychological defect or a result of childhood trauma.  But that's simply not true, according to the American Psychological Association. We need to base our views on facts and research, not on prejudice and misinformation.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and it's made me think a lot about drugs.  I mean, just because something is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad.  Take marijuana, for example.  I think it should be legal for medicinal purposes because its potential benefits shouldn't be ignored just because of its legal status.  It's not like it's heroin or cocaine.\n\nThink about it, pharmacies use lots of controlled substances like oxycontin, Vicodin, and Percocet all the time. They're helpful, right?  But there's this stigma around marijuana that makes people forget it could have similar benefits.\n\nAlcohol is different, though.  Both alcohol and marijuana can be abused, but I think we should focus on removing the taboo around marijuana first.  Maybe then people would use it more responsibly.\n\nHonestly, the way people view marijuana is totally unfair.  It's not nearly as dangerous as other drugs, so if we changed people's perceptions, they might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed and adapted to be more modern. It's not as strict as it used to be.  When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. That was the norm back then. I went to a private school and saw all my friends there every weekend.\n\nNow, things are different. They have a special mass for teenagers that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. You'll see families rushing in from the beach straight to church. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of the formal attire I wore before. It's definitely more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.\n\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing women priests or permitting priests to marry would have stopped those horrible acts.  There are married men who become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.  \n\nIf someone truly wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion, like some of the ones where ministers or reverends are allowed to marry. \n\nI think pedophilia has roots in genetics. It's something people are born with, not something they become.  You can't hide it through marriage. It might come out eventually. The church may have failed to address the issue properly in some cases, but I don't believe they could have prevented it altogether.",
            "Man, you know, at first I was cool with the idea of the Iraq War, but everyone was still super shook up from 9/11. It felt like we rushed into it, using it as an excuse.  I mean, the Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, and we all know that turned out to be a big fat lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way. The whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush team straight-up lied to the American people, and they still haven't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that huge speech at the UN, now says he wasn't totally convinced by the evidence back then, even while he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong, plain and simple. It's like, how can you lie to the country like that? That's gotta be grounds for impeachment! And it's not just that; it feels like the Bush administration has been trying to push the Constitution aside ever since 9/11.\n\nIt seems like they came into office wanting to go to war. I can't remember the name of the Treasury Secretary who said this, but he wrote about it in his book after he got pushed out. It sounds like the younger Bush had some personal beef with Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and maybe he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. It's all pretty sneaky if you ask me.\n\nI think it's gone on long enough, though. If we pulled out right now, things could get really messy and even more people could die. It seems like the UN and the US are trying to get countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help set things right. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could cause more problems in the long run because it messes with Iraq's sovereignty. \n\nThe government is falling apart. The news says the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in charge. Even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, his party now has seats in Parliament!  We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for control, and it's creating a lot of chaos.",
            "I'm not sure how to put this into words.  It feels like a pointless war, you know? I mean, it wasn't even officially declared. It just feels like we invaded Iraq because we thought they were behind 9/11.  Honestly, I don't really follow the news about it closely. I don't know all the details.\n\nBut, from what I gather, we're still there trying to build democracy and get access to their oil.  The problem is, it's creating a lot of anger. Staying there forever to build a democracy will take ages, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up.\n\nIt's a real dilemma.  It makes me wonder if we should even call it a war anymore. We never actually declared it. It seems like we're just showing off our military power and trying to make ourselves look big.\n\nPart of me feels like we should stay and help them, but it's also costing us so much, and it's making President Bush look bad. I worry he'll become known as the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nThen there are the families with loved ones in Iraq. I hate to say it, but I want the war to end for them, but I also don't want us to just abandon the people of Iraq. They've lost so much.\n\nI feel like if we stay, we'll try to make them more like us, which could backfire. It might make things worse and fuel more hatred towards America. \n\nThis whole situation feels like it's going to drag on forever. Ugh, it's just so complicated.",
            "You know, I don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or for any state to even try to say it's okay.  It just seems like something the churches should decide for themselves. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and it seems to me that trying to control or influence this issue goes against what's already been established.\n\nI think people pushing to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe in some areas like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can or can't do.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Constitution and something that allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even though there have been talks about making an amendment,  I think adding one about this would be completely wrong and go against what's already written. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that's actually used to restrict people instead of the government, which doesn't seem right.\n\nI firmly believe the federal government, or any government for that matter, shouldn't be involved in this. I don't understand why someone would push for this amendment unless it's based on their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're just trying to favor one religion over all others.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There isn't really a good reason to support this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else in a negative way. In fact, it might even have a positive impact on society.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I really don't think the government was completely honest with us about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used our fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.  Personally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes.\n\nThis Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and we should have learned from our mistakes there.  A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and just removed the Iraqi government without really thinking about what would happen next. They didn't plan for the chaos, the power vacuum, and all the fallout. The US is trying to install a democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but pushing out Communists and trying to force democracy on a country is never easy. It's a long and difficult process, and we should have known that going in.\n\nIt wasn't a clear-cut victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss, because no matter how many people support you, there will always be insurgents. You can't defeat a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to, we needed to be prepared for everything. We weren't ready for the aftermath, for what would happen once they took out Saddam Hussein.\n\nWe're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a long process.  \n\nThe government kind of misled the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission. But implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history! It took a long struggle to get to the strong democracy we have today.\n\nSo, what do we do now? It's a tough decision. We can't just abandon Iraq now after everything we've done. But how many more lives are we willing to lose for a free and democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be honest, why just Iraq? Why not other countries? I think the oil is a big factor. We need that oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\n\nRemember, they also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any. But North Korea has those weapons, and we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough.\n\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there, but I'm not very optimistic.",
            "I'm a big supporter of gay marriage, always have been.  It's a personal choice, and research shows it could even be biological rather than social.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control.  I think it's unfair and inhumane.  I've always been an advocate for equal rights for everyone, including gay couples.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. It's a personal matter, something between two people and their families.  In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and being part of the community.  \n\nIt seems like President Bush is trying to play God by interpreting marriage in his own way. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from lots of sources that being gay might be a biological thing, something you're predisposed to. It's not a choice you make based on your upbringing or environment.  \n\nBesides the obvious, I think it's unfair that a couple can just run off and get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal. It should be a private matter, something between the couple and their family, not something that's splashed all over the news.  It shouldn't be a national issue.",
            "So, basically, when you put something on the internet, it's out there for everyone to see.  It's like a public space. As an RA, I've dealt with this before.  Once you post something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you're talking about causing harm, like explosions or shootings, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet reaches everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their posts.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if it's the school that got the alert, someone saw it and reported it. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just people messing around. Maybe it was a social experiment that went wrong, like for a sociology class. \n\nOr maybe it was something really serious. In this case, something happened at school, someone overheard a conversation, and they reported it. When they looked through the person's Facebook, they found things that were concerning, even if the person meant them as a joke. In the end, the internet doesn't offer much privacy. If you don't want people to see something, don't post it. You can't control how people interpret it.\n\nIt's not okay for school officials to be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy because the person shared it with others. If there's a potential danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI think schools should focus on what's brought to their attention directly, not on monitoring phone calls, texts, or IMs.",
            "I feel like this war has dragged on far too long. At the start, the goal seemed good—to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're fighting just to prove our power, not for any real reason.  \n\nPlus, I wonder if the motives were ever truly pure. There were definitely connections to personal grudges between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to help establish democracy, that would be a noble cause. But if personal matters were involved, then it's not right.\n\nRegardless, the war has gone on way too long. We made our point in the beginning, but hanging on for years just isn't necessary. Their government and people need to figure things out on their own.\n\nIt's draining our economy. We're spending billions on a war that seems to have lost its purpose, while neglecting our own problems like poverty, failing infrastructure, and inadequate healthcare. That money could be better used to help our own citizens.  \n\nIt's just not right to keep pouring resources into a war that seems endless. We need to bring our troops home and focus on solving the issues we have right here at home.",
            "So, someone was asking if it was okay for someone to look at people's Myspace profiles to prevent something bad from happening.  I think it's pretty much fair game if you post something online, especially on a site like Myspace where you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. If you're friends with someone, you're giving them permission to see what you post.  \n\nIt's tough though, because you can't have someone constantly checking everyone's profiles. It would be like singling out certain kids as \"bad\" and targeting them. It's a tricky situation. Maybe it depends on the situation. If someone sees something specific that raises a red flag, then it might be justified. \n\nI personally have a Facebook, and it's unsettling knowing that anyone could see my information. I once saw a news story about a guy who easily found someone's information from their profile and started chatting with them. It's scary how much information is out there.  \n\nI try to be careful about what I share online, but it's hard because I want to connect with my friends. It's a balancing act. \n\nI also heard that some high schools actually banned Myspace.  It seems strange to me that schools would have that kind of control over what their students do online.  It feels like a privacy issue.",
            "I feel awkward talking about the Iraq War, you know? It's hard not to feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon of people who were against it from the start.  But honestly, looking back, it's clear to me that it was a mistake.  Everyone seems to agree, except maybe for the people in the government who don't want to admit they were wrong.  There have been polls everywhere – in the U.S., Iraq, and globally – showing that 75 to 80% of people think the war was a bad idea.  Even a lot of the U.S. troops stationed there believe we should get out within the next year.\n\nIt feels like everything about the war has been a disaster, even before we even went in.  Pulling out is going to be a mess too, and there's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's a clash of cultures, and it seems like our government just doesn't understand that. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit. \n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country should never be taken lightly.  You have to weigh the pros and cons carefully, and in this case, the cons far outweigh the pros.  It's like quicksand – once we went in, we got stuck.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason for us to stay there. The administration probably has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, and maybe there are some risks involved in leaving. But I haven't heard any convincing reasons why we shouldn't just go.\n\nIf they wanted to pull out gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have much of a problem with that. But the longer we stay, the worse it seems to get. I read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a lot of them want us to leave right now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nIf we ask them what they want, and they say they want us to leave, then at least we can say we gave them a choice. If things go bad after that, we can say we tried to do what was best, but they ultimately made the decision.  Maybe then we could at least be seen as the good guys, or at least less bad.",
            "Yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S. It's not just about women though. It's more about the specific field you're working in.  I mean, overall, women face tougher times because of that invisible \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is the goal, many people struggle to work for a woman in a leadership position, just because of how society's always been. So, often, women see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because traditionally, women haven't held top positions in business. And, I guess the same goes for men too.  \n\nThink about things like being a stay-at-home parent. It's super uncommon for a man to stay home while his wife works. People often judge them, assuming the man should be the breadwinner. It can be tough for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be at home with their kids, even if their wife has the higher-paying job.  But society doesn't get it.\n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Men who are into fashion, especially straight men, sometimes don't get taken seriously. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because people think guys who are into fashion have different lifestyles. So, if a guy fits the typical mold and he's in fashion, people might wonder, \"How can he really understand fashion if he's not more like us, the women?\"\n\nIt's like, depending on your field, there's definitely gender discrimination in the U.S. Changing it is tough because society has a set way of thinking, even though we've come a long way since the 1800s. Change is slow, but women are rising in business, becoming CEOs and getting more acceptance.  It's happening, and people are starting to get on board.\n\nThe same goes for stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the wife is the better earner, or maybe she just wants to work. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their wives or female friends and understanding where men are coming from.\n\nSo, we have to promote these stereotypes by showing off the good qualities of those who are usually looked down on, but not in a pushy way. You can't force change, or people will resist. We're in a good spot where things are starting to change naturally.  \n\nI don't think there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time, and we've already come a long way.  \n\nOh, and I think people discriminate against each other based on where they're from too. If a guy grew up on a farm and his grammar isn't perfect, but he's super smart and becomes a CEO, some men might make fun of him, saying things like, \"How can I trust you if you don't even speak correctly?\" You know?",
            "So, they didn't exactly make marijuana legal, they decriminalized it.  \n\nThink of it like this: instead of being a criminal offense, it's now more like a traffic ticket.  You get cited, but you don't get arrested, booked, or hauled into jail. \n\nThere are still some downsides though.  Even with decriminalization, things like job interviews might still be affected.  Those big, scary consequences of a drug charge, they don't always disappear.\n\nBut, on the other hand, getting caught with marijuana used to cost taxpayers a ton of money.  Think about it: arresting people, holding them in jail, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all adds up. \n\nPlaces that are struggling financially might be hesitant to decriminalize even if it saved them money. \n\nSome places, like Denver, are more open to the idea.  They might even use the money saved to fund things like education, social programs, and food assistance.  \n\nIt's important to remember that just because something is decriminalized doesn't mean it should be everywhere.  We need to be careful about how it's handled.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could end up like cigarettes, sold in gas stations and smoked everywhere.  That could lead to more people smoking and driving, and it might just feel uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nI think alcohol actually has a bigger impact on your ability to drive safely, but marijuana can be more disruptive to someone's everyday life.  \n\nUltimately, every substance affects people differently.  Some people can handle it better than others.  It's tough to generalize.",
            "I'd say yes, because a lot of what they do is pretty traditional. They've done things the same way for ages, and it's good to have those roots. But it's also important to be able to change with the times, you know?  \n\nA lot of Catholics think they have to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow every single rule perfectly.  They don't really accept people who aren't exactly \"ideal\" Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions either.  Like, for example, my dad was an Episcopalian and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nIt doesn't seem very tolerant of other faiths to me. We were always taught to love everyone, which is a Catholic thing, but it feels hypocritical to say you love others and then not accept them the way they are.  So, a lot of Catholic teachings are about doing things a certain way, but then the way they actually practice goes against it because it's so stuck in the past.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily change things. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop priests from abusing children. It's a whole different issue.  It might help a little, but I'm not sure.\n\n\nI mean, people who hurt children probably would do it whether or not they were married. It's about a power imbalance, not about being married or not. If someone is going to abuse a child, they're going to do it whether they have a spouse or not. I don't think letting priests get married would stop that from happening.",
            "I'm still figuring out my stance on this whole marriage equality debate. It's really tough, you know? It feels like it walks a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means.  It's hard not to offend anyone when you're trying to define something so personal. \n\nI'm leaning towards the idea that all unions, whether they're between two men, two women, or a man and a woman, should be treated as civil unions.  After all, the government doesn't get involved in religious ceremonies like baptism, right?  Why should marriage be any different?  It's about two people coming together, and that's what matters.\n\nI think it's important for the government to stay out of people's personal lives and not dictate who they can marry.  If all the states can agree on a reasonable solution, maybe they could push for it to become federal law.  \n\nBut a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That seems extreme.  Changing the constitution shouldn't be taken lightly, especially for something like this. It's a big deal for some people, but I don't think it's important enough to warrant amending the constitution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated. I have lots of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe they should have the right to marry. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each individual state.\n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, while others are more conservative. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and people living there should be able to live in accordance with their state's values. If you choose to live in a state that legalizes it, you're essentially accepting that decision.\n\nBasically, I think everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, deserves equal opportunities. So, I believe in leaving the decision of whether or not to legalize gay marriage up to each state. \n\nI don't think President Bush should have the power to ban it nationwide.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should govern itself. Plus, with a new president potentially coming in soon, it's likely to become a back-and-forth issue. It's best to let individual states make their own choices, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences.",
            "Look, I get it. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Whatever you post, anyone can see it. So if you're putting something on there, you kind of have to assume people are going to see it, even people like school officials. I mean, even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut when it comes to preventing something terrible like a school shooting, I think the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe. If they see something online that makes them think a student might be a danger, I think it's okay for them to look into it. \n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around looking for kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That's an invasion of privacy. But if it's about protecting kids, I think it's fine. \n\nThink about it: you wouldn't want to send your kid to a school where the staff wasn't doing everything they could to keep them safe, right? \n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't want to put anything nasty about someone in an email because you never know who might see it later.  Everything online can come back to bite you. \n\nSo, yeah, I think the school officials were justified in looking at the Myspace page. They were just trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Okay, so, about the war... at first, I was all for it because 9/11 hit me personally. I wanted revenge, you know? But looking back, I think we went in too emotionally.  We didn't really plan things out, and now I think it backfired.\n\nI don't think being there is helping. It seems like they're just fighting amongst themselves anyway, and we're caught in the middle.  Honestly, because of 9/11, I've kind of checked out. I don't care what happens over there anymore.\n\nIt's frustrating. They're so different from us when it comes to war. It's savage. They don't want to make their country better; they just want us out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were more angry than anything when we went in.  We wanted revenge, and I think President Bush let that dictate his actions.  But I get it, we couldn't just ignore what happened.\n\nI just wish we had a better plan. We didn't know what we were walking into, and I don't think we had a clear goal. There wasn't any unity. \n\nWe made some progress, but it's not enough.  We can't stay forever, and I honestly think things will just fall apart once we leave. We're hurting ourselves by staying there."
