            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Their views on certain issues might be causing them to lose followers. I think this is because the Church isn't very accepting of many things. For instance, when it comes to gay marriages, abortions, and birth control, the Church has very strong views, but they may be a bit outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, they'd likely worry less about losing their following.\n\nI've noticed that some people are starting to turn against the Church due to their stance on these issues. This is because people have different views on these subjects, and they feel that the Church is holding the wrong views. For example, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't agree with that.\n\nIt's interesting to think about why the Church is against things like female priests and priests being married. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe if priests were allowed to be married or if women could be priests, things would be different, but I'm not convinced it would have made a significant difference.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married, considering the Church views them as being married to God and devoted to their lives as priests. It's like any other job - people have their professional lives and their personal lives. The fact that priests can't have both seems outdated.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that I've given this a lot of thought, and I don't actually have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. It seems unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their sexual orientation. I mean, think about it - people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I'm straight and others are gay. It's not something they can switch or change at will. I don't think the government should be involved in this, as it's not a matter of security or morality - it's a personal issue that doesn't concern them. To me, it's just about treating people with respect and allowing them to live their lives as they are. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who can and can't get married based on their orientation. It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nIn fact, it's kind of simple - the government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives unless it affects the country's security or well-being. But this isn't about that. It's about two people loving each other and wanting to get married. I don't think the government should be in a position to deny them that. It's just common sense, you know? Let people be who they are and live their lives without the government breathing down their necks. It's really not that complicated.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I think it's wrong to deny gay people the right to get married. It's just basic human decency. They shouldn't be punished for being who they are, and the government shouldn't be involved in their personal lives. It's as simple as that.\n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it - I think the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not their call. People should be free to love who they want and get married to whoever they choose, without the government getting in the way.\n\nI'm not going to dwell on this anymore, but I just wanted to share my thoughts. I hope that makes sense.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct things that can't be equated. Each side of the coin is unique, and it's not fair to judge one over the other. The truth is, homosexual couples have the same rights as everyone else, like having their partner by their side in times of need, even in a hospital or when it comes to tax laws and healthcare benefits.\n\nIt's ridiculous that partners in a same-sex relationship can't be considered family in the eyes of the law. They're committed to each other, and that's what matters most. Scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples, which is a clear indication that love is love, regardless of orientation.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that homosexual couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church ceremony. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are no different from straight couples in many ways, like the roles they play in their relationships.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about adoption, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these are just new issues that we're still learning about. However, it's hard to deny the fact that children from gay parents are just as capable and deserving of love and respect as any other child. In fact, some schools in cities like New York City even have special programs for kids from gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nThe real issue is that the government should take a stand on this matter and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The current amendment opposing it is a clear example of hypocrisy, as it goes against the principles of equality and freedom that America claims to uphold. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" pledge shows that people are willing to challenge laws that enforce religious standards, so why not apply the same logic to gay marriage?\n\nOne of the main reasons people are against gay marriage is the misconception that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims, and it's time we listen to the experts rather than popular opinion or personal biases. If we did, we'd see the world in a different light and recognize the beauty of love in all its forms.",
            "Okay, let's get this straight. I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I want to make one thing clear: just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. I mean, think about it - there are plenty of prescription meds that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them all the time to help people, and that's exactly what I think we should be doing with marijuana.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is that different from other substances that are abused, like alcohol. Sure, abusing it can lead to problems, but so can abusing alcohol. It's a tough one, I'll admit it. But I think we should take a step back and look at the benefits of marijuana. If we could remove the stigma around it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes. It's not some evil substance like heroin or cocaine - it's got its own set of risks and benefits.\n\nIf we're going to make it available to the public, it shouldn't be all or nothing. A gradual approach might work better, but first, we need to change the way people think about marijuana. It's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, and if we can get past that, maybe we can use it to help people instead of shunning it. That's my two cents, anyway.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. I've noticed this change since I was a kid, going to church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little outfit and matching accessories. I went to a private school and church was a big part of my weekend routine, seeing my friends there was always a highlight. Now, they've introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, which is only 30 minutes long, and people dress in casual attire, especially during summer. It's become more laid-back, even at morning masses where I used to dress up, now people wear jeans and khakis. I think this shift is noticeable, it's the biggest change I've seen. As for other things, that's pretty much it, I don't really know the church's politics, but that's my take on it. \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these situations. There are men who are married and still become pedophiles, it's not about their marital status. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and there are other religions where they can be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I think pedophilia is rooted in genetics, people are born with these tendencies, and it's not something that can be hidden or changed through marriage. The church can't prevent something that's innate, and if they knew about it and covered it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they always knew. As for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have any.",
            "(laughs) \nAt first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we entered Iraq using it as a pretext, with various reasons leading us into the conflict. I believe the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and still hasn't taken responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave that pivotal speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power and an impeachable offense.\n\nI think the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. When I think back to that time, it's clear that the administration had it out for Saddam Hussein, partly due to a grudge carried over from his dad's administration, and also to expand our energy supply – which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI'm not sure how long this can go on, but I believe withdrawing now could be problematic, as there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in more deaths. The current alternative, where the UN and US are considering a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, doesn't seem like a great idea to me. This could create more long-term issues, particularly with Iraq's sovereignty, as it appears the interim government is disintegrating. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the situation.\n\nWith groups like Mugtada al-Sadr's party holding significant power in the Iraqi Parliament and radical elements vying for control, the political process is experiencing significant friction. I'm not sure I can articulate all the issues in polite conversation, but it's clear this is a complex and messy situation.",
            "I'm really struggling to find the right words on this. Okay, let's get the basics out of the way first. To be honest, I don't know much about the Iraq War. I mean, it wasn't officially declared as a war, which already makes it tricky to discuss. I think it started as a sort of revenge for 9/11, targeting the people we believed were responsible. But, to be frank, I don't follow this closely, and I'm not sure about all the details. As far as I understand, we're trying to build a democracy in Iraq, making it more like the US, and also securing oil resources. However, this approach is causing a lot of tension and distress.\n\nWe're stuck between a rock and a hard place. If we stay, we'll be tasked with building a democracy, which can't be done overnight, and it'll take a lot of time and effort. But, if we leave, the Iraqis will be left to deal with the mess we created, and they'll blame us for it. I'm not sure what the right course of action is, to be honest.\n\nThis topic is really challenging for me because I don't know enough about it, and I'm not sure where to start. If you have any points you'd like me to focus on, I'd appreciate it.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war should be considered over, not just because of the lack of a formal declaration, but also because it's become more about showing our power and military might than achieving a genuine goal. It's like we're using force to prove a point, rather than working towards a solution.\n\nI'm torn, though. On one hand, I think we should help the Iraqis, but on the other, I worry about the resources we're wasting and the potential consequences of our actions. I feel sorry for President Bush, as this war is making him look really bad, much like the Vietnam War did. It's like history is repeating itself.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether I want the war to end or continue, because I think about all the families who have loved ones fighting in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. However, I also think that our presence is causing more harm than good, as we're disrupting their culture and creating more divisions among the different groups in Iraq. I worry that our attempts to impose our way of life on them will only lead to more resentment and hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, and it's hard to see a clear solution. That's about all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it a law or even recognize it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially considering the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a pretty straightforward principle that's been set in stone, and I think trying to impose any kind of authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established.\n\nTo me, allowing government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal is essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. It's clear that a lot of Catholics and Christians are against it, and it's mainly being opposed in certain areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what's acceptable or not within the church.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I think trying to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be wrong and contradict the existing values. It's one of the few amendments that would actually restrict the people rather than limiting government power, which is exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to do.\n\nPersonally, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I believe the president's push for an amendment is mainly driven by his own Catholic beliefs and personal views. It's showing a preference for one religion over others, which I don't think is fair. The churches should be the ones making these decisions, not the government. There's no clear reasoning behind this amendment other than personal opinions, and I don't see how it would benefit the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive impact by [REWRITE] (some words were missing from the original text, if you could provide them I can rewrite it accordingly)",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. I've been thinking, and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. They tried to link it to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not like they were directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, and that's a big part of why the invasion started in 2003. As someone who's generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, I was strongly opposed to this one.\n\nIt's kind of like the Vietnam War all over again - the government should have learned from past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in this war, which is incredibly sad. What they did was remove the Iraqi government, and I don't think the US government was ready for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They're trying to install democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but it's not that easy. It's a long and hard process, and the US government underestimated the challenges they'd face.\n\nNo matter how many Iraqis wanted the US to intervene, there are still tons of insurgents, and it's hard to defeat them when you're fighting the citizens of the country, not an actual army. I think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes before invading, but they weren't prepared for the aftermath. We're still there in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. It's a long process to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take care of their own country, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be a quick and easy success.\n\nWe shouldn't have gone to war in the first place, but if we were going to do it, we should have been more honest with ourselves and the American people about the risks and challenges involved. It's not like democracy is something that can be easily imposed on a country; it's a long and difficult process, as we learned in our own country's history. The US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do, but it's not.\n\nIt's a tough decision to make, especially when you think about all the American lives lost and the country's resources being spent. Once you're in, it's hard to leave, especially when you've taken away someone else's government and way of life. We should try to see it through, but at the same time, there's a limit to how much we can risk American lives for the sake of a free, democratic Iraq. If we're really committed to spreading democracy, why not do it in other countries too? The truth is, it's often about oil and control of resources. The whole thing about Iraq having WMDs was a big factor in the decision to go to war, but no WMDs were ever found, and we're not doing anything about North Korea, which we know has WMDs. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest enough in its decision-making.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not optimistic. It's not looking good.",
            "I'm thinking about gay marriage, and I've always been on board with the idea. To me, it comes down to personal preference, and with recent studies showing that it might be biological rather than a social construct, it just doesn't seem right to deny people the right because of something they can't control. I think it's inhumane to do so. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I don't think the government should have a say in it – it's a personal, household issue. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs, live their lives, and it's clear that their relationship is no different from anyone else's.\n\nIt's ridiculous that politicians, like Bush, think they can dictate what marriage means. I've read and heard from various sources that research suggests homosexuality might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which is something people are born with, not something they choose. It's not like growing up in a certain environment or with certain family dynamics determines someone's sexual orientation.\n\nThe thing is, if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it's all over the news. That's just not right. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's thrust into the public domain.",
            "Honestly, I don't know where to start with this.  When you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's completely public knowledge. You can't just put something out there without considering how others might react. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this kind of situation before. Once you post something, it's going to influence people's opinions about you. If you start talking about violence or sensitive topics, someone's bound to take it seriously. You can't just post that kind of thing online because it's seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll get their bulletin, and if someone's concerned enough to report it, the school has to act. They can't just ignore it, especially if there's a risk of something bad happening. On the other hand, it's hard to know what's real and what's just a joke, especially when people can be careless with their online posts. \n\nWhat happened here was that someone overheard something in school, reported it, and when we found out who the person was, they looked at their social media and found some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a different tone in light of the situation. When you post something online, there's no such thing as privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people think or what they take seriously. I don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media or snooping around their profiles, but if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's not, then it's a different story. I also don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, especially if they post about it online. That's not my place to know, and it's not something I'd want to deal with.",
            "To be honest, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Originally, the goal was to bring democracy to a nation that desperately needed it. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose and are now possibly fighting just to prove our military superiority.\n\nI have to wonder if the true motives behind the war were genuine from the start, considering George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If our initial goal was to bring democracy to a country with a flawed government system, then that would have been a justifiable reason. But if there were personal interests at play, I think that would have been unfair.\n\nIn my opinion, we made our point clear in the first few months of the war - it was a powerful statement. But continuing the conflict for over a year, even years, seems excessive. If our intention was to give people living under a tyrant a chance for freedom, that's a noble cause, and I think that's a good reason to go to war. However, I believe our reasons have been distorted and misinterpreted over time, and it seems like we're fighting just to say we're fighting.\n\nI genuinely think it's time to call an end to this war. The Iraqi government should take responsibility for its own affairs, and it's clear that time has come. We're spending billions of dollars on this conflict, money that could be better spent on our own problems, such as poverty, inadequate public services, and healthcare. It's staggering to think that we're allocating such a large portion of our budget to war efforts, which have lost their initial purpose.\n\nIn my opinion, war should not be a long-term investment. We have pressing issues on our own turf, such as crumbling infrastructure, underfunded schools, and healthcare. It's heartbreaking to see our citizens being killed in a foreign war that we've lost sight of its cause. I think that's the harsh reality we need to face.",
            "To clarify, something stopped happening because someone went online and saw a certain post.\nOkay, so you know how on Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much available to everyone who's connected to you?\nI mean, if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they can see your profile, and you've basically given them permission to do so by accepting them as a friend.\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, it's likely that a lot of people will see it.\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that post and was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from arising.\n\nHowever, this raises some tough questions. I mean, it's not feasible for just one person to be constantly monitoring everyone's online profiles to prevent problems. That would be a form of discrimination if they're only targeting certain individuals. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to sift through people's online profiles, unless they have a good reason to do so, like if they actually found something suspicious.\nIt's all about the context - were they just randomly looking through profiles or were they actively searching for something?\nI'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my information. I've seen a report on TV about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and even convince them to meet with him. It's scary to think about how easily people can access personal info and use it for malicious purposes. I've even had people from my classes IM me, despite not knowing my username, and it's hard to know who's really behind the screen. They can see my interests, my class schedule, my friends, and even photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends online. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've heard that some schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, but I'm not sure how they have the authority to do so. That seems like a privacy issue to me, but I'm not sure how they got the right to dictate what their students can and can't do online.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I'll go ahead and discuss my thoughts on the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical saying this, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's been made clear by now that this invasion was a bad idea, with most people, including the administration, acknowledging this in hindsight.\n\nRecent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and even 70% of US troops stationed in the country believe that the war was a poor decision. This suggests that a significant majority of people, both at home and abroad, think it was a mistake.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the very beginning, and pulling out now will also be challenging. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are vast, making it difficult for the US to impose its views and values on the region. The idea of forcing democracy on a culture that doesn't naturally adopt it is misguided.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam was a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The quicksand-like situation we've created in Iraq is a prime example of this. I don't see a compelling reason for the US to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.\n\nThe administration might have some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't seen a clear, legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually, over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't understand why we can't leave now.\n\nInterestingly, a significant majority of Iraqis – around 80% – think we should leave within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, yet they're telling us to leave. This suggests they might know better than us, and if we ask them to leave, we can say we respected their wishes, even if things don't go well after that.\n\nIf we decide to help them after leaving, at least we'll be seen as trying to make amends, even if we're not perfect. We can't change our past mistakes, but we can try to make things better in the future. It's not about being the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but about avoiding further catastrophe.",
            "I have to agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; I believe it also affects men in certain fields. You see, in many industries, people still struggle with finding equality, especially when it comes to working under a woman. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for a long time. \n\nFor example, women are often held back from promotions because of these stereotypes, despite having the qualifications for the job. It's also common for men to face judgment when they choose to be stay-at-home dads. People might think it's unusual for men to prioritize childcare, and it can be tough for them to break free from these expectations. I also think that men in the fashion industry often face prejudice if they're not 'typical' or don't fit the mold of what people expect. \n\nThe problem is that changing this mindset takes time, and it's slow progress. However, we've made significant strides, especially with more women taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs. As people become more accepting of these changes, it's becoming more common to see men staying home with their kids and women being the breadwinners. It's also helping to break down stereotypes in the fashion industry, where people are starting to take men in fashion seriously, regardless of their style or background.\n\nI guess the key is to promote understanding and acceptance without being too pushy or aggressive. If we force people to change their views too quickly, they'll resist. We're at a good point now where we're starting to see progress, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done. People are still discriminated against based on their background, education, and even their speech patterns, which can be just as limiting as gender bias. It's not just about promoting equality between genders; it's also about recognizing and addressing other forms of prejudice that exist in our society.",
            "Alright, so decriminalizing marijuana isn't the same as legalizing it; it just means that it's been reduced from a criminal offense to a more of a traffic ticket kind of thing. You get cited but not arrested. Now, when it comes to things like job interviews, that sort of thing, the ramifications might not be as bad as they would be with a full-fledged drug charge. But even though decriminalization takes away some of the harsher consequences, it doesn't eliminate them entirely. People still worry about how this will affect their future, and that's valid. On the other hand, arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana use can be really expensive - think about all the costs of bringing someone in, letting them go, and then going through the court process. Some cities might be hesitant to make that investment, even if it would free up some money for other important things.\n\nTake Denver, though, which is a pretty open-minded place. They've seen a financial boost since decriminalizing marijuana, which they can now use for education, social programs, and helping those in need. It's not just about the money, though - there are plenty of reasons why marijuana shouldn't be legal everywhere. For instance, it could lead to more smoking and driving, which is a big concern. Plus, marijuana is still generally seen as taboo in many societies, so having it out in the open could be uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nAs for the effects of marijuana and alcohol, it's hard to generalize because everyone reacts differently. Some people have a harder time with moderation, while others can handle it just fine. In terms of driving and decision-making skills, alcohol tends to have more of a negative impact, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, when it comes to substances, there's no one-size-fits-all answer because people respond differently.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to [the idea of allowing priests to be married] because a lot of the traditional practices within the Catholic Church have been around for a long time, and it's great to have a sense of tradition. However, it's also essential to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. One thing that's always concerned me is how strict the Church can be, not just with its rules but also in judging those who don't follow them perfectly. I'm talking about how they treat people from other faiths, like my parents, who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, but couldn't get married in the Church because of my father's background. This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, especially considering the Catholic teaching of loving others. It seems like the doctrine and practice don't always align, especially when it comes to outdated rules.\n\nWhile I think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, I'm not convinced that it would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior. People who engage in such acts tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a separate issue altogether, one that's not directly related to whether or not someone is married. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't magically fix the problem, and it's unlikely to make a difference in the long run.\n\nIt's true that some people might do whatever they want, regardless of their marital status. If someone has a tendency to harm children, they'll probably do so whether they're married or not. So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to this issue. It's not a simple fix, and it's not something that can be solved by a single change in the Church's rules.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this topic.  I haven't given it much thought yet, so I don't know if either side is right or wrong. This issue seems to be the most challenging one we're facing. It's tough to navigate the separation of church and state, especially when it comes to defining marriage, without offending anyone. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I think that civil unions might be the way to go. I'm not convinced that marriage should be regulated by the government, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament. If it were just a civil union, people wouldn't get special tax breaks or treatment just because they're married.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't care about the specifics of the marriage as long as it's between two consenting adults. It's not their place to interfere with the separation of church and state. If two people want to get a civil union, that's all that matters.\n\nI also think that making gay marriage a federal law would be a good idea if all states can come to a logical agreement. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems ridiculous. It's a big issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant altering the constitution.\n\nIt's just not that crucial to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. It's really not that important.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this either.",
            "I come from a Christian background, but to be honest, the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a complex issue for me. On one hand, I have close gay friends, so I've had a chance to understand their perspective. While I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do think it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter for the federal government to decide, but rather something that each state should determine on its own.\n\nI believe this is because different states have different values and opinions. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, while Republican states may not. If you live in a state that has decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think it's right to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to live there. I think everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have equal opportunities, which is why I believe it should be left up to each state to decide.\n\nI do disagree with President Bush's stance on banning gay marriage, and I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He can't make decisions for every state, and his ban is unlikely to be in place forever. A new president could come in and repeal it, so why not let each state decide for itself? They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of the decision, not the president. Ultimately, I think it's up to each state to make its own choice on this issue.",
            "Honestly, I'm not at all in agreement with this. Let me think for a moment. I suppose it's worth noting that Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're basically sharing it with the public. If you look at the definition of a bulletin, it's essentially a post intended for others to see. So, if you post something online, you have to be aware that it's going to be seen by others, including school officials, even if it's not under the school's name. They could still access it from their homes, after all. \n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring the internet to prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine that they're doing it. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. I mean, if they're looking through Myspace to catch students engaging in underage drinking or other prohibited activities, I do think that's an invasion of privacy. However, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nI think it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing, and it's true that Myspace is a public platform. If a student posts something on Myspace and then gets in trouble for it, that's not unusual. I'm careful about what I post online, like even in emails. I'm worried that something I say could come back to haunt me later.\n\nIf you post something as a college student, it's likely to follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever, and there's no taking it back. If you do something that gets you in trouble, you'll have to face the consequences. I don't think this is an invasion of privacy, because as I said before, Myspace is a public platform. What I'm saying is that I don't think school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's okay. When parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment, and that's what the school officials were trying to achieve in this case. They were just taking precautions to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nMy teacher discussed this with me at my public high school, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is safe. They did drills and lockdowns in case of a terrorist attack, and it's similar to what happened with the school shooting. They were just trying to make the school a safer place, and that's what the school officials were doing in this case – taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.",
            "Honestly, I've had time to reflect on our decision to go to war, and my perspective has shifted. To be frank, I was initially all for it because it was a deeply personal issue for me, especially after 9/11. I felt a strong desire to make a difference and cause chaos, just like they had done to us. However, I now think we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into it without a clear plan.\n\nI believe that the emotional toll of 9/11 clouded our judgment, and we went in unprepared. Unfortunately, this led to a disastrous outcome. I've come to realize that as long as the different factions over there are fighting each other, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't be there to try to fix their problems; instead, we should focus on our own security.\n\nTo be honest, I've lost interest in the conflict and those people. It's hard to care about their struggles when they can't even cooperate with each other. I think we went in there with a misguided sense of purpose, fueled by emotions rather than reason. We were looking for revenge, and President Bush seemed to be driven by public opinion and a desire to take action. However, I understand his perspective at the time.\n\nI don't think we had a choice but to respond to the situation, but I do think we could have done it differently. We should have had a clearer plan for creating order and a more unified effort. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case, and we ended up creating more chaos.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're capable of changing those people; they're stuck in their ways. We're just prolonging our own suffering by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify our continued involvement. In the end, it's only a matter of time before things fall apart, and we can't stay there forever. I genuinely believe we're doing more harm than good by remaining there."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Their views on certain issues might be causing them to lose followers. I think this is because the Church isn't very accepting of many things. For instance, when it comes to gay marriages, abortions, and birth control, the Church has very strong views, but they may be a bit outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, they'd likely worry less about losing their following.\n\nI've noticed that some people are starting to turn against the Church due to their stance on these issues. This is because people have different views on these subjects, and they feel that the Church is holding the wrong views. For example, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't agree with that.\n\nIt's interesting to think about why the Church is against things like female priests and priests being married. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe if priests were allowed to be married or if women could be priests, things would be different, but I'm not convinced it would have made a significant difference.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married, considering the Church views them as being married to God and devoted to their lives as priests. It's like any other job - people have their professional lives and their personal lives. The fact that priests can't have both seems outdated.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that I've given this a lot of thought, and I don't actually have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. It seems unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their sexual orientation. I mean, think about it - people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I'm straight and others are gay. It's not something they can switch or change at will. I don't think the government should be involved in this, as it's not a matter of security or morality - it's a personal issue that doesn't concern them. To me, it's just about treating people with respect and allowing them to live their lives as they are. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who can and can't get married based on their orientation. It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nIn fact, it's kind of simple - the government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives unless it affects the country's security or well-being. But this isn't about that. It's about two people loving each other and wanting to get married. I don't think the government should be in a position to deny them that. It's just common sense, you know? Let people be who they are and live their lives without the government breathing down their necks. It's really not that complicated.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I think it's wrong to deny gay people the right to get married. It's just basic human decency. They shouldn't be punished for being who they are, and the government shouldn't be involved in their personal lives. It's as simple as that.\n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it - I think the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not their call. People should be free to love who they want and get married to whoever they choose, without the government getting in the way.\n\nI'm not going to dwell on this anymore, but I just wanted to share my thoughts. I hope that makes sense.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct things that can't be equated. Each side of the coin is unique, and it's not fair to judge one over the other. The truth is, homosexual couples have the same rights as everyone else, like having their partner by their side in times of need, even in a hospital or when it comes to tax laws and healthcare benefits.\n\nIt's ridiculous that partners in a same-sex relationship can't be considered family in the eyes of the law. They're committed to each other, and that's what matters most. Scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples, which is a clear indication that love is love, regardless of orientation.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that homosexual couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church ceremony. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are no different from straight couples in many ways, like the roles they play in their relationships.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about adoption, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these are just new issues that we're still learning about. However, it's hard to deny the fact that children from gay parents are just as capable and deserving of love and respect as any other child. In fact, some schools in cities like New York City even have special programs for kids from gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nThe real issue is that the government should take a stand on this matter and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The current amendment opposing it is a clear example of hypocrisy, as it goes against the principles of equality and freedom that America claims to uphold. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" pledge shows that people are willing to challenge laws that enforce religious standards, so why not apply the same logic to gay marriage?\n\nOne of the main reasons people are against gay marriage is the misconception that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims, and it's time we listen to the experts rather than popular opinion or personal biases. If we did, we'd see the world in a different light and recognize the beauty of love in all its forms.",
            "Okay, let's get this straight. I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I want to make one thing clear: just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. I mean, think about it - there are plenty of prescription meds that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them all the time to help people, and that's exactly what I think we should be doing with marijuana.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is that different from other substances that are abused, like alcohol. Sure, abusing it can lead to problems, but so can abusing alcohol. It's a tough one, I'll admit it. But I think we should take a step back and look at the benefits of marijuana. If we could remove the stigma around it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes. It's not some evil substance like heroin or cocaine - it's got its own set of risks and benefits.\n\nIf we're going to make it available to the public, it shouldn't be all or nothing. A gradual approach might work better, but first, we need to change the way people think about marijuana. It's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, and if we can get past that, maybe we can use it to help people instead of shunning it. That's my two cents, anyway.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. I've noticed this change since I was a kid, going to church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little outfit and matching accessories. I went to a private school and church was a big part of my weekend routine, seeing my friends there was always a highlight. Now, they've introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, which is only 30 minutes long, and people dress in casual attire, especially during summer. It's become more laid-back, even at morning masses where I used to dress up, now people wear jeans and khakis. I think this shift is noticeable, it's the biggest change I've seen. As for other things, that's pretty much it, I don't really know the church's politics, but that's my take on it. \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these situations. There are men who are married and still become pedophiles, it's not about their marital status. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and there are other religions where they can be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I think pedophilia is rooted in genetics, people are born with these tendencies, and it's not something that can be hidden or changed through marriage. The church can't prevent something that's innate, and if they knew about it and covered it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they always knew. As for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have any.",
            "(laughs) \nAt first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we entered Iraq using it as a pretext, with various reasons leading us into the conflict. I believe the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and still hasn't taken responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave that pivotal speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power and an impeachable offense.\n\nI think the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. When I think back to that time, it's clear that the administration had it out for Saddam Hussein, partly due to a grudge carried over from his dad's administration, and also to expand our energy supply – which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI'm not sure how long this can go on, but I believe withdrawing now could be problematic, as there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in more deaths. The current alternative, where the UN and US are considering a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, doesn't seem like a great idea to me. This could create more long-term issues, particularly with Iraq's sovereignty, as it appears the interim government is disintegrating. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the situation.\n\nWith groups like Mugtada al-Sadr's party holding significant power in the Iraqi Parliament and radical elements vying for control, the political process is experiencing significant friction. I'm not sure I can articulate all the issues in polite conversation, but it's clear this is a complex and messy situation.",
            "I'm really struggling to find the right words on this. Okay, let's get the basics out of the way first. To be honest, I don't know much about the Iraq War. I mean, it wasn't officially declared as a war, which already makes it tricky to discuss. I think it started as a sort of revenge for 9/11, targeting the people we believed were responsible. But, to be frank, I don't follow this closely, and I'm not sure about all the details. As far as I understand, we're trying to build a democracy in Iraq, making it more like the US, and also securing oil resources. However, this approach is causing a lot of tension and distress.\n\nWe're stuck between a rock and a hard place. If we stay, we'll be tasked with building a democracy, which can't be done overnight, and it'll take a lot of time and effort. But, if we leave, the Iraqis will be left to deal with the mess we created, and they'll blame us for it. I'm not sure what the right course of action is, to be honest.\n\nThis topic is really challenging for me because I don't know enough about it, and I'm not sure where to start. If you have any points you'd like me to focus on, I'd appreciate it.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war should be considered over, not just because of the lack of a formal declaration, but also because it's become more about showing our power and military might than achieving a genuine goal. It's like we're using force to prove a point, rather than working towards a solution.\n\nI'm torn, though. On one hand, I think we should help the Iraqis, but on the other, I worry about the resources we're wasting and the potential consequences of our actions. I feel sorry for President Bush, as this war is making him look really bad, much like the Vietnam War did. It's like history is repeating itself.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether I want the war to end or continue, because I think about all the families who have loved ones fighting in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. However, I also think that our presence is causing more harm than good, as we're disrupting their culture and creating more divisions among the different groups in Iraq. I worry that our attempts to impose our way of life on them will only lead to more resentment and hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, and it's hard to see a clear solution. That's about all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it a law or even recognize it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially considering the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a pretty straightforward principle that's been set in stone, and I think trying to impose any kind of authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established.\n\nTo me, allowing government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal is essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. It's clear that a lot of Catholics and Christians are against it, and it's mainly being opposed in certain areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what's acceptable or not within the church.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I think trying to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be wrong and contradict the existing values. It's one of the few amendments that would actually restrict the people rather than limiting government power, which is exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to do.\n\nPersonally, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I believe the president's push for an amendment is mainly driven by his own Catholic beliefs and personal views. It's showing a preference for one religion over others, which I don't think is fair. The churches should be the ones making these decisions, not the government. There's no clear reasoning behind this amendment other than personal opinions, and I don't see how it would benefit the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive impact by [REWRITE] (some words were missing from the original text, if you could provide them I can rewrite it accordingly)",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. I've been thinking, and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. They tried to link it to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not like they were directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, and that's a big part of why the invasion started in 2003. As someone who's generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, I was strongly opposed to this one.\n\nIt's kind of like the Vietnam War all over again - the government should have learned from past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in this war, which is incredibly sad. What they did was remove the Iraqi government, and I don't think the US government was ready for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They're trying to install democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but it's not that easy. It's a long and hard process, and the US government underestimated the challenges they'd face.\n\nNo matter how many Iraqis wanted the US to intervene, there are still tons of insurgents, and it's hard to defeat them when you're fighting the citizens of the country, not an actual army. I think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes before invading, but they weren't prepared for the aftermath. We're still there in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. It's a long process to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take care of their own country, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be a quick and easy success.\n\nWe shouldn't have gone to war in the first place, but if we were going to do it, we should have been more honest with ourselves and the American people about the risks and challenges involved. It's not like democracy is something that can be easily imposed on a country; it's a long and difficult process, as we learned in our own country's history. The US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do, but it's not.\n\nIt's a tough decision to make, especially when you think about all the American lives lost and the country's resources being spent. Once you're in, it's hard to leave, especially when you've taken away someone else's government and way of life. We should try to see it through, but at the same time, there's a limit to how much we can risk American lives for the sake of a free, democratic Iraq. If we're really committed to spreading democracy, why not do it in other countries too? The truth is, it's often about oil and control of resources. The whole thing about Iraq having WMDs was a big factor in the decision to go to war, but no WMDs were ever found, and we're not doing anything about North Korea, which we know has WMDs. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest enough in its decision-making.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not optimistic. It's not looking good.",
            "I'm thinking about gay marriage, and I've always been on board with the idea. To me, it comes down to personal preference, and with recent studies showing that it might be biological rather than a social construct, it just doesn't seem right to deny people the right because of something they can't control. I think it's inhumane to do so. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I don't think the government should have a say in it – it's a personal, household issue. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs, live their lives, and it's clear that their relationship is no different from anyone else's.\n\nIt's ridiculous that politicians, like Bush, think they can dictate what marriage means. I've read and heard from various sources that research suggests homosexuality might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which is something people are born with, not something they choose. It's not like growing up in a certain environment or with certain family dynamics determines someone's sexual orientation.\n\nThe thing is, if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it's all over the news. That's just not right. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's thrust into the public domain.",
            "Honestly, I don't know where to start with this.  When you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's completely public knowledge. You can't just put something out there without considering how others might react. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this kind of situation before. Once you post something, it's going to influence people's opinions about you. If you start talking about violence or sensitive topics, someone's bound to take it seriously. You can't just post that kind of thing online because it's seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll get their bulletin, and if someone's concerned enough to report it, the school has to act. They can't just ignore it, especially if there's a risk of something bad happening. On the other hand, it's hard to know what's real and what's just a joke, especially when people can be careless with their online posts. \n\nWhat happened here was that someone overheard something in school, reported it, and when we found out who the person was, they looked at their social media and found some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a different tone in light of the situation. When you post something online, there's no such thing as privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people think or what they take seriously. I don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media or snooping around their profiles, but if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's not, then it's a different story. I also don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, especially if they post about it online. That's not my place to know, and it's not something I'd want to deal with.",
            "To be honest, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Originally, the goal was to bring democracy to a nation that desperately needed it. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose and are now possibly fighting just to prove our military superiority.\n\nI have to wonder if the true motives behind the war were genuine from the start, considering George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If our initial goal was to bring democracy to a country with a flawed government system, then that would have been a justifiable reason. But if there were personal interests at play, I think that would have been unfair.\n\nIn my opinion, we made our point clear in the first few months of the war - it was a powerful statement. But continuing the conflict for over a year, even years, seems excessive. If our intention was to give people living under a tyrant a chance for freedom, that's a noble cause, and I think that's a good reason to go to war. However, I believe our reasons have been distorted and misinterpreted over time, and it seems like we're fighting just to say we're fighting.\n\nI genuinely think it's time to call an end to this war. The Iraqi government should take responsibility for its own affairs, and it's clear that time has come. We're spending billions of dollars on this conflict, money that could be better spent on our own problems, such as poverty, inadequate public services, and healthcare. It's staggering to think that we're allocating such a large portion of our budget to war efforts, which have lost their initial purpose.\n\nIn my opinion, war should not be a long-term investment. We have pressing issues on our own turf, such as crumbling infrastructure, underfunded schools, and healthcare. It's heartbreaking to see our citizens being killed in a foreign war that we've lost sight of its cause. I think that's the harsh reality we need to face.",
            "To clarify, something stopped happening because someone went online and saw a certain post.\nOkay, so you know how on Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much available to everyone who's connected to you?\nI mean, if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they can see your profile, and you've basically given them permission to do so by accepting them as a friend.\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, it's likely that a lot of people will see it.\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that post and was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from arising.\n\nHowever, this raises some tough questions. I mean, it's not feasible for just one person to be constantly monitoring everyone's online profiles to prevent problems. That would be a form of discrimination if they're only targeting certain individuals. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to sift through people's online profiles, unless they have a good reason to do so, like if they actually found something suspicious.\nIt's all about the context - were they just randomly looking through profiles or were they actively searching for something?\nI'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my information. I've seen a report on TV about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and even convince them to meet with him. It's scary to think about how easily people can access personal info and use it for malicious purposes. I've even had people from my classes IM me, despite not knowing my username, and it's hard to know who's really behind the screen. They can see my interests, my class schedule, my friends, and even photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends online. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've heard that some schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, but I'm not sure how they have the authority to do so. That seems like a privacy issue to me, but I'm not sure how they got the right to dictate what their students can and can't do online.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I'll go ahead and discuss my thoughts on the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical saying this, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's been made clear by now that this invasion was a bad idea, with most people, including the administration, acknowledging this in hindsight.\n\nRecent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and even 70% of US troops stationed in the country believe that the war was a poor decision. This suggests that a significant majority of people, both at home and abroad, think it was a mistake.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the very beginning, and pulling out now will also be challenging. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are vast, making it difficult for the US to impose its views and values on the region. The idea of forcing democracy on a culture that doesn't naturally adopt it is misguided.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam was a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The quicksand-like situation we've created in Iraq is a prime example of this. I don't see a compelling reason for the US to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.\n\nThe administration might have some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't seen a clear, legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually, over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't understand why we can't leave now.\n\nInterestingly, a significant majority of Iraqis – around 80% – think we should leave within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, yet they're telling us to leave. This suggests they might know better than us, and if we ask them to leave, we can say we respected their wishes, even if things don't go well after that.\n\nIf we decide to help them after leaving, at least we'll be seen as trying to make amends, even if we're not perfect. We can't change our past mistakes, but we can try to make things better in the future. It's not about being the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but about avoiding further catastrophe.",
            "I have to agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; I believe it also affects men in certain fields. You see, in many industries, people still struggle with finding equality, especially when it comes to working under a woman. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for a long time. \n\nFor example, women are often held back from promotions because of these stereotypes, despite having the qualifications for the job. It's also common for men to face judgment when they choose to be stay-at-home dads. People might think it's unusual for men to prioritize childcare, and it can be tough for them to break free from these expectations. I also think that men in the fashion industry often face prejudice if they're not 'typical' or don't fit the mold of what people expect. \n\nThe problem is that changing this mindset takes time, and it's slow progress. However, we've made significant strides, especially with more women taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs. As people become more accepting of these changes, it's becoming more common to see men staying home with their kids and women being the breadwinners. It's also helping to break down stereotypes in the fashion industry, where people are starting to take men in fashion seriously, regardless of their style or background.\n\nI guess the key is to promote understanding and acceptance without being too pushy or aggressive. If we force people to change their views too quickly, they'll resist. We're at a good point now where we're starting to see progress, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done. People are still discriminated against based on their background, education, and even their speech patterns, which can be just as limiting as gender bias. It's not just about promoting equality between genders; it's also about recognizing and addressing other forms of prejudice that exist in our society.",
            "Alright, so decriminalizing marijuana isn't the same as legalizing it; it just means that it's been reduced from a criminal offense to a more of a traffic ticket kind of thing. You get cited but not arrested. Now, when it comes to things like job interviews, that sort of thing, the ramifications might not be as bad as they would be with a full-fledged drug charge. But even though decriminalization takes away some of the harsher consequences, it doesn't eliminate them entirely. People still worry about how this will affect their future, and that's valid. On the other hand, arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana use can be really expensive - think about all the costs of bringing someone in, letting them go, and then going through the court process. Some cities might be hesitant to make that investment, even if it would free up some money for other important things.\n\nTake Denver, though, which is a pretty open-minded place. They've seen a financial boost since decriminalizing marijuana, which they can now use for education, social programs, and helping those in need. It's not just about the money, though - there are plenty of reasons why marijuana shouldn't be legal everywhere. For instance, it could lead to more smoking and driving, which is a big concern. Plus, marijuana is still generally seen as taboo in many societies, so having it out in the open could be uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nAs for the effects of marijuana and alcohol, it's hard to generalize because everyone reacts differently. Some people have a harder time with moderation, while others can handle it just fine. In terms of driving and decision-making skills, alcohol tends to have more of a negative impact, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, when it comes to substances, there's no one-size-fits-all answer because people respond differently.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to [the idea of allowing priests to be married] because a lot of the traditional practices within the Catholic Church have been around for a long time, and it's great to have a sense of tradition. However, it's also essential to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. One thing that's always concerned me is how strict the Church can be, not just with its rules but also in judging those who don't follow them perfectly. I'm talking about how they treat people from other faiths, like my parents, who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, but couldn't get married in the Church because of my father's background. This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, especially considering the Catholic teaching of loving others. It seems like the doctrine and practice don't always align, especially when it comes to outdated rules.\n\nWhile I think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, I'm not convinced that it would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior. People who engage in such acts tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a separate issue altogether, one that's not directly related to whether or not someone is married. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't magically fix the problem, and it's unlikely to make a difference in the long run.\n\nIt's true that some people might do whatever they want, regardless of their marital status. If someone has a tendency to harm children, they'll probably do so whether they're married or not. So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to this issue. It's not a simple fix, and it's not something that can be solved by a single change in the Church's rules.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this topic.  I haven't given it much thought yet, so I don't know if either side is right or wrong. This issue seems to be the most challenging one we're facing. It's tough to navigate the separation of church and state, especially when it comes to defining marriage, without offending anyone. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I think that civil unions might be the way to go. I'm not convinced that marriage should be regulated by the government, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament. If it were just a civil union, people wouldn't get special tax breaks or treatment just because they're married.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't care about the specifics of the marriage as long as it's between two consenting adults. It's not their place to interfere with the separation of church and state. If two people want to get a civil union, that's all that matters.\n\nI also think that making gay marriage a federal law would be a good idea if all states can come to a logical agreement. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems ridiculous. It's a big issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant altering the constitution.\n\nIt's just not that crucial to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. It's really not that important.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this either.",
            "I come from a Christian background, but to be honest, the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a complex issue for me. On one hand, I have close gay friends, so I've had a chance to understand their perspective. While I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do think it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter for the federal government to decide, but rather something that each state should determine on its own.\n\nI believe this is because different states have different values and opinions. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, while Republican states may not. If you live in a state that has decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think it's right to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to live there. I think everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have equal opportunities, which is why I believe it should be left up to each state to decide.\n\nI do disagree with President Bush's stance on banning gay marriage, and I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He can't make decisions for every state, and his ban is unlikely to be in place forever. A new president could come in and repeal it, so why not let each state decide for itself? They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of the decision, not the president. Ultimately, I think it's up to each state to make its own choice on this issue.",
            "Honestly, I'm not at all in agreement with this. Let me think for a moment. I suppose it's worth noting that Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're basically sharing it with the public. If you look at the definition of a bulletin, it's essentially a post intended for others to see. So, if you post something online, you have to be aware that it's going to be seen by others, including school officials, even if it's not under the school's name. They could still access it from their homes, after all. \n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring the internet to prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine that they're doing it. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. I mean, if they're looking through Myspace to catch students engaging in underage drinking or other prohibited activities, I do think that's an invasion of privacy. However, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nI think it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing, and it's true that Myspace is a public platform. If a student posts something on Myspace and then gets in trouble for it, that's not unusual. I'm careful about what I post online, like even in emails. I'm worried that something I say could come back to haunt me later.\n\nIf you post something as a college student, it's likely to follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever, and there's no taking it back. If you do something that gets you in trouble, you'll have to face the consequences. I don't think this is an invasion of privacy, because as I said before, Myspace is a public platform. What I'm saying is that I don't think school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's okay. When parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment, and that's what the school officials were trying to achieve in this case. They were just taking precautions to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nMy teacher discussed this with me at my public high school, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is safe. They did drills and lockdowns in case of a terrorist attack, and it's similar to what happened with the school shooting. They were just trying to make the school a safer place, and that's what the school officials were doing in this case – taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.",
            "Honestly, I've had time to reflect on our decision to go to war, and my perspective has shifted. To be frank, I was initially all for it because it was a deeply personal issue for me, especially after 9/11. I felt a strong desire to make a difference and cause chaos, just like they had done to us. However, I now think we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into it without a clear plan.\n\nI believe that the emotional toll of 9/11 clouded our judgment, and we went in unprepared. Unfortunately, this led to a disastrous outcome. I've come to realize that as long as the different factions over there are fighting each other, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't be there to try to fix their problems; instead, we should focus on our own security.\n\nTo be honest, I've lost interest in the conflict and those people. It's hard to care about their struggles when they can't even cooperate with each other. I think we went in there with a misguided sense of purpose, fueled by emotions rather than reason. We were looking for revenge, and President Bush seemed to be driven by public opinion and a desire to take action. However, I understand his perspective at the time.\n\nI don't think we had a choice but to respond to the situation, but I do think we could have done it differently. We should have had a clearer plan for creating order and a more unified effort. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case, and we ended up creating more chaos.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're capable of changing those people; they're stuck in their ways. We're just prolonging our own suffering by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify our continued involvement. In the end, it's only a matter of time before things fall apart, and we can't stay there forever. I genuinely believe we're doing more harm than good by remaining there."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Their views on certain issues might be causing them to lose followers. I think this is because the Church isn't very accepting of many things. For instance, when it comes to gay marriages, abortions, and birth control, the Church has very strong views, but they may be a bit outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, they'd likely worry less about losing their following.\n\nI've noticed that some people are starting to turn against the Church due to their stance on these issues. This is because people have different views on these subjects, and they feel that the Church is holding the wrong views. For example, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't agree with that.\n\nIt's interesting to think about why the Church is against things like female priests and priests being married. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe if priests were allowed to be married or if women could be priests, things would be different, but I'm not convinced it would have made a significant difference.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married, considering the Church views them as being married to God and devoted to their lives as priests. It's like any other job - people have their professional lives and their personal lives. The fact that priests can't have both seems outdated.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that I've given this a lot of thought, and I don't actually have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. It seems unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their sexual orientation. I mean, think about it - people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I'm straight and others are gay. It's not something they can switch or change at will. I don't think the government should be involved in this, as it's not a matter of security or morality - it's a personal issue that doesn't concern them. To me, it's just about treating people with respect and allowing them to live their lives as they are. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who can and can't get married based on their orientation. It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nIn fact, it's kind of simple - the government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives unless it affects the country's security or well-being. But this isn't about that. It's about two people loving each other and wanting to get married. I don't think the government should be in a position to deny them that. It's just common sense, you know? Let people be who they are and live their lives without the government breathing down their necks. It's really not that complicated.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I think it's wrong to deny gay people the right to get married. It's just basic human decency. They shouldn't be punished for being who they are, and the government shouldn't be involved in their personal lives. It's as simple as that.\n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it - I think the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not their call. People should be free to love who they want and get married to whoever they choose, without the government getting in the way.\n\nI'm not going to dwell on this anymore, but I just wanted to share my thoughts. I hope that makes sense.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct things that can't be equated. Each side of the coin is unique, and it's not fair to judge one over the other. The truth is, homosexual couples have the same rights as everyone else, like having their partner by their side in times of need, even in a hospital or when it comes to tax laws and healthcare benefits.\n\nIt's ridiculous that partners in a same-sex relationship can't be considered family in the eyes of the law. They're committed to each other, and that's what matters most. Scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples, which is a clear indication that love is love, regardless of orientation.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that homosexual couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church ceremony. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are no different from straight couples in many ways, like the roles they play in their relationships.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about adoption, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these are just new issues that we're still learning about. However, it's hard to deny the fact that children from gay parents are just as capable and deserving of love and respect as any other child. In fact, some schools in cities like New York City even have special programs for kids from gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nThe real issue is that the government should take a stand on this matter and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The current amendment opposing it is a clear example of hypocrisy, as it goes against the principles of equality and freedom that America claims to uphold. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" pledge shows that people are willing to challenge laws that enforce religious standards, so why not apply the same logic to gay marriage?\n\nOne of the main reasons people are against gay marriage is the misconception that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims, and it's time we listen to the experts rather than popular opinion or personal biases. If we did, we'd see the world in a different light and recognize the beauty of love in all its forms.",
            "Okay, let's get this straight. I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I want to make one thing clear: just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. I mean, think about it - there are plenty of prescription meds that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them all the time to help people, and that's exactly what I think we should be doing with marijuana.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is that different from other substances that are abused, like alcohol. Sure, abusing it can lead to problems, but so can abusing alcohol. It's a tough one, I'll admit it. But I think we should take a step back and look at the benefits of marijuana. If we could remove the stigma around it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes. It's not some evil substance like heroin or cocaine - it's got its own set of risks and benefits.\n\nIf we're going to make it available to the public, it shouldn't be all or nothing. A gradual approach might work better, but first, we need to change the way people think about marijuana. It's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, and if we can get past that, maybe we can use it to help people instead of shunning it. That's my two cents, anyway.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. I've noticed this change since I was a kid, going to church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little outfit and matching accessories. I went to a private school and church was a big part of my weekend routine, seeing my friends there was always a highlight. Now, they've introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, which is only 30 minutes long, and people dress in casual attire, especially during summer. It's become more laid-back, even at morning masses where I used to dress up, now people wear jeans and khakis. I think this shift is noticeable, it's the biggest change I've seen. As for other things, that's pretty much it, I don't really know the church's politics, but that's my take on it. \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these situations. There are men who are married and still become pedophiles, it's not about their marital status. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and there are other religions where they can be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I think pedophilia is rooted in genetics, people are born with these tendencies, and it's not something that can be hidden or changed through marriage. The church can't prevent something that's innate, and if they knew about it and covered it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they always knew. As for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have any.",
            "(laughs) \nAt first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we entered Iraq using it as a pretext, with various reasons leading us into the conflict. I believe the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and still hasn't taken responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave that pivotal speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power and an impeachable offense.\n\nI think the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. When I think back to that time, it's clear that the administration had it out for Saddam Hussein, partly due to a grudge carried over from his dad's administration, and also to expand our energy supply – which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI'm not sure how long this can go on, but I believe withdrawing now could be problematic, as there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in more deaths. The current alternative, where the UN and US are considering a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, doesn't seem like a great idea to me. This could create more long-term issues, particularly with Iraq's sovereignty, as it appears the interim government is disintegrating. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the situation.\n\nWith groups like Mugtada al-Sadr's party holding significant power in the Iraqi Parliament and radical elements vying for control, the political process is experiencing significant friction. I'm not sure I can articulate all the issues in polite conversation, but it's clear this is a complex and messy situation.",
            "I'm really struggling to find the right words on this. Okay, let's get the basics out of the way first. To be honest, I don't know much about the Iraq War. I mean, it wasn't officially declared as a war, which already makes it tricky to discuss. I think it started as a sort of revenge for 9/11, targeting the people we believed were responsible. But, to be frank, I don't follow this closely, and I'm not sure about all the details. As far as I understand, we're trying to build a democracy in Iraq, making it more like the US, and also securing oil resources. However, this approach is causing a lot of tension and distress.\n\nWe're stuck between a rock and a hard place. If we stay, we'll be tasked with building a democracy, which can't be done overnight, and it'll take a lot of time and effort. But, if we leave, the Iraqis will be left to deal with the mess we created, and they'll blame us for it. I'm not sure what the right course of action is, to be honest.\n\nThis topic is really challenging for me because I don't know enough about it, and I'm not sure where to start. If you have any points you'd like me to focus on, I'd appreciate it.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war should be considered over, not just because of the lack of a formal declaration, but also because it's become more about showing our power and military might than achieving a genuine goal. It's like we're using force to prove a point, rather than working towards a solution.\n\nI'm torn, though. On one hand, I think we should help the Iraqis, but on the other, I worry about the resources we're wasting and the potential consequences of our actions. I feel sorry for President Bush, as this war is making him look really bad, much like the Vietnam War did. It's like history is repeating itself.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether I want the war to end or continue, because I think about all the families who have loved ones fighting in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. However, I also think that our presence is causing more harm than good, as we're disrupting their culture and creating more divisions among the different groups in Iraq. I worry that our attempts to impose our way of life on them will only lead to more resentment and hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, and it's hard to see a clear solution. That's about all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it a law or even recognize it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially considering the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a pretty straightforward principle that's been set in stone, and I think trying to impose any kind of authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established.\n\nTo me, allowing government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal is essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. It's clear that a lot of Catholics and Christians are against it, and it's mainly being opposed in certain areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what's acceptable or not within the church.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I think trying to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be wrong and contradict the existing values. It's one of the few amendments that would actually restrict the people rather than limiting government power, which is exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to do.\n\nPersonally, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I believe the president's push for an amendment is mainly driven by his own Catholic beliefs and personal views. It's showing a preference for one religion over others, which I don't think is fair. The churches should be the ones making these decisions, not the government. There's no clear reasoning behind this amendment other than personal opinions, and I don't see how it would benefit the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive impact by [REWRITE] (some words were missing from the original text, if you could provide them I can rewrite it accordingly)",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. I've been thinking, and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. They tried to link it to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not like they were directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, and that's a big part of why the invasion started in 2003. As someone who's generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, I was strongly opposed to this one.\n\nIt's kind of like the Vietnam War all over again - the government should have learned from past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in this war, which is incredibly sad. What they did was remove the Iraqi government, and I don't think the US government was ready for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They're trying to install democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but it's not that easy. It's a long and hard process, and the US government underestimated the challenges they'd face.\n\nNo matter how many Iraqis wanted the US to intervene, there are still tons of insurgents, and it's hard to defeat them when you're fighting the citizens of the country, not an actual army. I think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes before invading, but they weren't prepared for the aftermath. We're still there in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. It's a long process to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take care of their own country, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be a quick and easy success.\n\nWe shouldn't have gone to war in the first place, but if we were going to do it, we should have been more honest with ourselves and the American people about the risks and challenges involved. It's not like democracy is something that can be easily imposed on a country; it's a long and difficult process, as we learned in our own country's history. The US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do, but it's not.\n\nIt's a tough decision to make, especially when you think about all the American lives lost and the country's resources being spent. Once you're in, it's hard to leave, especially when you've taken away someone else's government and way of life. We should try to see it through, but at the same time, there's a limit to how much we can risk American lives for the sake of a free, democratic Iraq. If we're really committed to spreading democracy, why not do it in other countries too? The truth is, it's often about oil and control of resources. The whole thing about Iraq having WMDs was a big factor in the decision to go to war, but no WMDs were ever found, and we're not doing anything about North Korea, which we know has WMDs. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest enough in its decision-making.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not optimistic. It's not looking good.",
            "I'm thinking about gay marriage, and I've always been on board with the idea. To me, it comes down to personal preference, and with recent studies showing that it might be biological rather than a social construct, it just doesn't seem right to deny people the right because of something they can't control. I think it's inhumane to do so. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I don't think the government should have a say in it – it's a personal, household issue. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs, live their lives, and it's clear that their relationship is no different from anyone else's.\n\nIt's ridiculous that politicians, like Bush, think they can dictate what marriage means. I've read and heard from various sources that research suggests homosexuality might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which is something people are born with, not something they choose. It's not like growing up in a certain environment or with certain family dynamics determines someone's sexual orientation.\n\nThe thing is, if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it's all over the news. That's just not right. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's thrust into the public domain.",
            "Honestly, I don't know where to start with this.  When you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's completely public knowledge. You can't just put something out there without considering how others might react. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this kind of situation before. Once you post something, it's going to influence people's opinions about you. If you start talking about violence or sensitive topics, someone's bound to take it seriously. You can't just post that kind of thing online because it's seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll get their bulletin, and if someone's concerned enough to report it, the school has to act. They can't just ignore it, especially if there's a risk of something bad happening. On the other hand, it's hard to know what's real and what's just a joke, especially when people can be careless with their online posts. \n\nWhat happened here was that someone overheard something in school, reported it, and when we found out who the person was, they looked at their social media and found some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a different tone in light of the situation. When you post something online, there's no such thing as privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people think or what they take seriously. I don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media or snooping around their profiles, but if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's not, then it's a different story. I also don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, especially if they post about it online. That's not my place to know, and it's not something I'd want to deal with.",
            "To be honest, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Originally, the goal was to bring democracy to a nation that desperately needed it. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose and are now possibly fighting just to prove our military superiority.\n\nI have to wonder if the true motives behind the war were genuine from the start, considering George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If our initial goal was to bring democracy to a country with a flawed government system, then that would have been a justifiable reason. But if there were personal interests at play, I think that would have been unfair.\n\nIn my opinion, we made our point clear in the first few months of the war - it was a powerful statement. But continuing the conflict for over a year, even years, seems excessive. If our intention was to give people living under a tyrant a chance for freedom, that's a noble cause, and I think that's a good reason to go to war. However, I believe our reasons have been distorted and misinterpreted over time, and it seems like we're fighting just to say we're fighting.\n\nI genuinely think it's time to call an end to this war. The Iraqi government should take responsibility for its own affairs, and it's clear that time has come. We're spending billions of dollars on this conflict, money that could be better spent on our own problems, such as poverty, inadequate public services, and healthcare. It's staggering to think that we're allocating such a large portion of our budget to war efforts, which have lost their initial purpose.\n\nIn my opinion, war should not be a long-term investment. We have pressing issues on our own turf, such as crumbling infrastructure, underfunded schools, and healthcare. It's heartbreaking to see our citizens being killed in a foreign war that we've lost sight of its cause. I think that's the harsh reality we need to face.",
            "To clarify, something stopped happening because someone went online and saw a certain post.\nOkay, so you know how on Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much available to everyone who's connected to you?\nI mean, if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they can see your profile, and you've basically given them permission to do so by accepting them as a friend.\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, it's likely that a lot of people will see it.\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that post and was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from arising.\n\nHowever, this raises some tough questions. I mean, it's not feasible for just one person to be constantly monitoring everyone's online profiles to prevent problems. That would be a form of discrimination if they're only targeting certain individuals. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to sift through people's online profiles, unless they have a good reason to do so, like if they actually found something suspicious.\nIt's all about the context - were they just randomly looking through profiles or were they actively searching for something?\nI'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my information. I've seen a report on TV about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and even convince them to meet with him. It's scary to think about how easily people can access personal info and use it for malicious purposes. I've even had people from my classes IM me, despite not knowing my username, and it's hard to know who's really behind the screen. They can see my interests, my class schedule, my friends, and even photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends online. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've heard that some schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, but I'm not sure how they have the authority to do so. That seems like a privacy issue to me, but I'm not sure how they got the right to dictate what their students can and can't do online.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I'll go ahead and discuss my thoughts on the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical saying this, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's been made clear by now that this invasion was a bad idea, with most people, including the administration, acknowledging this in hindsight.\n\nRecent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and even 70% of US troops stationed in the country believe that the war was a poor decision. This suggests that a significant majority of people, both at home and abroad, think it was a mistake.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the very beginning, and pulling out now will also be challenging. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are vast, making it difficult for the US to impose its views and values on the region. The idea of forcing democracy on a culture that doesn't naturally adopt it is misguided.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam was a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The quicksand-like situation we've created in Iraq is a prime example of this. I don't see a compelling reason for the US to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.\n\nThe administration might have some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't seen a clear, legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually, over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't understand why we can't leave now.\n\nInterestingly, a significant majority of Iraqis – around 80% – think we should leave within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, yet they're telling us to leave. This suggests they might know better than us, and if we ask them to leave, we can say we respected their wishes, even if things don't go well after that.\n\nIf we decide to help them after leaving, at least we'll be seen as trying to make amends, even if we're not perfect. We can't change our past mistakes, but we can try to make things better in the future. It's not about being the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but about avoiding further catastrophe.",
            "I have to agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; I believe it also affects men in certain fields. You see, in many industries, people still struggle with finding equality, especially when it comes to working under a woman. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for a long time. \n\nFor example, women are often held back from promotions because of these stereotypes, despite having the qualifications for the job. It's also common for men to face judgment when they choose to be stay-at-home dads. People might think it's unusual for men to prioritize childcare, and it can be tough for them to break free from these expectations. I also think that men in the fashion industry often face prejudice if they're not 'typical' or don't fit the mold of what people expect. \n\nThe problem is that changing this mindset takes time, and it's slow progress. However, we've made significant strides, especially with more women taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs. As people become more accepting of these changes, it's becoming more common to see men staying home with their kids and women being the breadwinners. It's also helping to break down stereotypes in the fashion industry, where people are starting to take men in fashion seriously, regardless of their style or background.\n\nI guess the key is to promote understanding and acceptance without being too pushy or aggressive. If we force people to change their views too quickly, they'll resist. We're at a good point now where we're starting to see progress, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done. People are still discriminated against based on their background, education, and even their speech patterns, which can be just as limiting as gender bias. It's not just about promoting equality between genders; it's also about recognizing and addressing other forms of prejudice that exist in our society.",
            "Alright, so decriminalizing marijuana isn't the same as legalizing it; it just means that it's been reduced from a criminal offense to a more of a traffic ticket kind of thing. You get cited but not arrested. Now, when it comes to things like job interviews, that sort of thing, the ramifications might not be as bad as they would be with a full-fledged drug charge. But even though decriminalization takes away some of the harsher consequences, it doesn't eliminate them entirely. People still worry about how this will affect their future, and that's valid. On the other hand, arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana use can be really expensive - think about all the costs of bringing someone in, letting them go, and then going through the court process. Some cities might be hesitant to make that investment, even if it would free up some money for other important things.\n\nTake Denver, though, which is a pretty open-minded place. They've seen a financial boost since decriminalizing marijuana, which they can now use for education, social programs, and helping those in need. It's not just about the money, though - there are plenty of reasons why marijuana shouldn't be legal everywhere. For instance, it could lead to more smoking and driving, which is a big concern. Plus, marijuana is still generally seen as taboo in many societies, so having it out in the open could be uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nAs for the effects of marijuana and alcohol, it's hard to generalize because everyone reacts differently. Some people have a harder time with moderation, while others can handle it just fine. In terms of driving and decision-making skills, alcohol tends to have more of a negative impact, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, when it comes to substances, there's no one-size-fits-all answer because people respond differently.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to [the idea of allowing priests to be married] because a lot of the traditional practices within the Catholic Church have been around for a long time, and it's great to have a sense of tradition. However, it's also essential to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. One thing that's always concerned me is how strict the Church can be, not just with its rules but also in judging those who don't follow them perfectly. I'm talking about how they treat people from other faiths, like my parents, who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, but couldn't get married in the Church because of my father's background. This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, especially considering the Catholic teaching of loving others. It seems like the doctrine and practice don't always align, especially when it comes to outdated rules.\n\nWhile I think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, I'm not convinced that it would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior. People who engage in such acts tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a separate issue altogether, one that's not directly related to whether or not someone is married. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't magically fix the problem, and it's unlikely to make a difference in the long run.\n\nIt's true that some people might do whatever they want, regardless of their marital status. If someone has a tendency to harm children, they'll probably do so whether they're married or not. So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to this issue. It's not a simple fix, and it's not something that can be solved by a single change in the Church's rules.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this topic.  I haven't given it much thought yet, so I don't know if either side is right or wrong. This issue seems to be the most challenging one we're facing. It's tough to navigate the separation of church and state, especially when it comes to defining marriage, without offending anyone. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I think that civil unions might be the way to go. I'm not convinced that marriage should be regulated by the government, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament. If it were just a civil union, people wouldn't get special tax breaks or treatment just because they're married.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't care about the specifics of the marriage as long as it's between two consenting adults. It's not their place to interfere with the separation of church and state. If two people want to get a civil union, that's all that matters.\n\nI also think that making gay marriage a federal law would be a good idea if all states can come to a logical agreement. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems ridiculous. It's a big issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant altering the constitution.\n\nIt's just not that crucial to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. It's really not that important.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this either.",
            "I come from a Christian background, but to be honest, the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a complex issue for me. On one hand, I have close gay friends, so I've had a chance to understand their perspective. While I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do think it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter for the federal government to decide, but rather something that each state should determine on its own.\n\nI believe this is because different states have different values and opinions. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, while Republican states may not. If you live in a state that has decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think it's right to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to live there. I think everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have equal opportunities, which is why I believe it should be left up to each state to decide.\n\nI do disagree with President Bush's stance on banning gay marriage, and I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He can't make decisions for every state, and his ban is unlikely to be in place forever. A new president could come in and repeal it, so why not let each state decide for itself? They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of the decision, not the president. Ultimately, I think it's up to each state to make its own choice on this issue.",
            "Honestly, I'm not at all in agreement with this. Let me think for a moment. I suppose it's worth noting that Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're basically sharing it with the public. If you look at the definition of a bulletin, it's essentially a post intended for others to see. So, if you post something online, you have to be aware that it's going to be seen by others, including school officials, even if it's not under the school's name. They could still access it from their homes, after all. \n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring the internet to prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine that they're doing it. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. I mean, if they're looking through Myspace to catch students engaging in underage drinking or other prohibited activities, I do think that's an invasion of privacy. However, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nI think it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing, and it's true that Myspace is a public platform. If a student posts something on Myspace and then gets in trouble for it, that's not unusual. I'm careful about what I post online, like even in emails. I'm worried that something I say could come back to haunt me later.\n\nIf you post something as a college student, it's likely to follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever, and there's no taking it back. If you do something that gets you in trouble, you'll have to face the consequences. I don't think this is an invasion of privacy, because as I said before, Myspace is a public platform. What I'm saying is that I don't think school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's okay. When parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment, and that's what the school officials were trying to achieve in this case. They were just taking precautions to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nMy teacher discussed this with me at my public high school, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is safe. They did drills and lockdowns in case of a terrorist attack, and it's similar to what happened with the school shooting. They were just trying to make the school a safer place, and that's what the school officials were doing in this case – taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.",
            "Honestly, I've had time to reflect on our decision to go to war, and my perspective has shifted. To be frank, I was initially all for it because it was a deeply personal issue for me, especially after 9/11. I felt a strong desire to make a difference and cause chaos, just like they had done to us. However, I now think we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into it without a clear plan.\n\nI believe that the emotional toll of 9/11 clouded our judgment, and we went in unprepared. Unfortunately, this led to a disastrous outcome. I've come to realize that as long as the different factions over there are fighting each other, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't be there to try to fix their problems; instead, we should focus on our own security.\n\nTo be honest, I've lost interest in the conflict and those people. It's hard to care about their struggles when they can't even cooperate with each other. I think we went in there with a misguided sense of purpose, fueled by emotions rather than reason. We were looking for revenge, and President Bush seemed to be driven by public opinion and a desire to take action. However, I understand his perspective at the time.\n\nI don't think we had a choice but to respond to the situation, but I do think we could have done it differently. We should have had a clearer plan for creating order and a more unified effort. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case, and we ended up creating more chaos.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're capable of changing those people; they're stuck in their ways. We're just prolonging our own suffering by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify our continued involvement. In the end, it's only a matter of time before things fall apart, and we can't stay there forever. I genuinely believe we're doing more harm than good by remaining there."
