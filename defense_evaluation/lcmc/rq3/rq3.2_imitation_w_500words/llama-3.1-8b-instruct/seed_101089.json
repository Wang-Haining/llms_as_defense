            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to rethink some of its stances and make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. They have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated in my opinion. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, they might not be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and I think that's because they feel the Church is on the wrong side.\n\nI mean, if you're in favor of abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. And if you're gay or support gay marriage, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests – it's not like it would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe they would have done things differently, but it's hard to say.\n\nOne thing I do think the Church should reconsider is its stance on priests being allowed to be married. They say priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's a pretty unique job situation. Everyone else with a job has both a career and a personal life – so, I don't see why priests can't have both too.",
            "Honestly, I wanted to take a moment to clarify my thoughts on a sensitive topic. I've been considering this issue, and I don't think I'm opposed to the idea of gay marriage. It seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it would be unfair to hold gay people accountable for their natural inclinations.\n\nWhen I think about it, it doesn't seem right that society would deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their orientation. I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, but my gut feeling is that it's wrong for anyone to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they can control, just like how I'm naturally straight and others are naturally gay. It's not a choice that I think they should be held accountable for.\n\nTo me, it's clear that the federal government shouldn't involve themselves in this issue. It's not really a matter of the law, and it's certainly not a moral issue in my opinion. I don't think they have the right to dictate who can and can't get married based on something as personal as their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's a sensitive topic, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable discussing it, but I do think the federal government should stay out of it. It's not their place to interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as who they love. It's just not something they should be involved in.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. A lot of people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not true. It's two different things, you can't compare them. They're like two sides of the same coin - one isn't better than the other. People have the right to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, which are often denied to gay couples because they're not considered 'family'. It's crazy that if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't even be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. That's pretty shallow if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples. It's basically the same thing - a relationship is a relationship, and that's what matters. The problem is that people get hung up on the idea that gay couples want to get married in a church, but that's not true. They just want a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are treated unfairly, and it's not right. They have the same relationship dynamics, the same roles, and the same goals as straight couples. People worry about adoption and community issues, but those are separate problems. They're worried about how gay couples will affect their community, and how children of gay couples will turn out. But it's not that simple.\n\nIn New York City, for example, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. It's not fair. And it shows that the real issue is not the parents, but the society we live in. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples, and it's all about personal choices. The government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage, which align with his views on abortion and stem cell research, but that's not a good reason to deny people their rights. Morality is subjective, and it's not okay to impose someone's morality on the rest of the country. It's hypocritical to allow some people to enforce their religious views on everyone else. People are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect, but that's not supported by science. The American Psychological Association has disproven those claims, and it's time to listen to experts, not just popular opinion.",
            "Okay, so one thing - I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, people often think that just because something is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't have its good qualities. I mean, take it from a medical perspective. If a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it can't be beneficial. I'm not saying it should be available to the general public, no way, that's not where I'm coming from. But for medicinal purposes, I definitely think it's a different story. We don't use illegal substances in pharmacies because they're bad, but because they have benefits that we can harness.\n\nI mean, take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets - they're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Just because there's a stigma surrounding marijuana doesn't mean we should ignore its potential benefits. I think we should be open to its advantages, not dismiss it because of its current status.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is similar to alcohol in terms of abuse potential - while abusing either substance can lead to problems, marijuana's impact is different. I think we should approach its legalization gradually, but not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to get rid of the negative image surrounding marijuana. People have a skewed view of it because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made efforts to adapt to the modern era, becoming less strict than it used to be. Even from my own experience of attending church every Sunday as a kid, I've noticed the changes. I used to get all dressed up in cute outfits and go to a private school where I'd see my friends on the weekends. But now, especially during the summer, people show up to mass in casual beachwear, and even the morning masses are more relaxed, with people wearing jeans or khakis. It's definitely become a more casual atmosphere, which I think is a natural progression.\n\nAs for the bigger picture, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the problems with pedophilia in the Catholic Church. There are married individuals who still have a twisted attraction to young kids, and it's not solely because of their marital status. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should consider whether they can commit to the lifestyle. Some other religions, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church, allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's impossible to balance faith and marriage in this way.\n\nI think the root of the issue is that pedophilia is often an inborn trait, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing or environment. While genetics might play a role, you can't hide it through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's despicable, but I don't think that's always the case.\n\nOverall, the church's changes haven't had a significant impact on preventing these problems. My thoughts on the matter are that it's a complex issue, and I don't have any other specific opinions about the Catholic Church beyond that.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I believe that going to Iraq was partly a pretext. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but that turned out to be false. This whole thing bothered me, and the Iraq war really gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell, who presented that big UN speech, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious offense - lying to the public like that is unacceptable. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution and has been working to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they had a plan to go to war from the start.\n\nOne thing that really stands out is how the younger Bush seemed to have a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's past dealings with him, and I think he was also hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to reevaluate the situation, but withdrawing now could lead to even more problems, including a civil war that would result in more deaths. The current alternative being considered is a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to stabilize the country. However, I'm not sure that's the best idea, as it could create more problems in the long run, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The country's interim government is already showing signs of breaking down, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister has limited control, and radical elements are vying for power, causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know how to articulate my concerns in polite conversation.",
            "I'm still trying to process my thoughts about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's been a bit complicated for me. I think what's making it harder is that it wasn't even officially declared as a war. It just felt like a way to get back at someone after the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're stuck over there trying to build a democracy, which is a long-term goal, and also to get access to their resources. But the thing is, it's causing a lot of problems and making people upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to deal with the aftermath of trying to create a democracy, which won't happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing things up and having to start over. I'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nTo be honest, I'm really struggling to form an opinion on this. It's a complex topic, and I don't think I fully understand it. I think we should talk more about this and get a better grasp on the situation.\n\nI've been thinking, and I don't think we should call it a war anymore. It was never officially declared, and it's just become a way to show off our military strength. I think that's not the point of it all. It's about helping people, not just flexing our muscles.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but at the same time, we're wasting our resources, and it's making the President look bad. I'm not sure how much longer we can justify staying there. It's kind of like the Vietnam War – it was an undeclared war, and now it's considered a pointless war. I don't want our President to be known as the one who started a meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are people I know who have family members over there, and I want them to be safe. But at the same time, I don't want us to be there because it's messing with their culture and way of life. We're trying to change them into something they're not, and it's just making things worse. I think we're actually making the Al-Kaida problem worse by trying to impose our own values on them.\n\nI think this whole thing is going to drag on for years and years, and I'm not sure what the outcome will be. I guess that's just my two cents on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state to declare something as legal or to make laws about it. In my opinion, that's a decision that should be left to the churches. The constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any form of state control over this issue would be a direct defiance of what's already been written.\n\nI think people trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with some areas like Boston being exceptions. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't dictate as right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think making an amendment to restrict this would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict people's rights rather than the government's, and I don't believe that's right.\n\nTo me, the government should stay out of this issue altogether. I don't see why there's a push for this amendment, except that it's against the president's own personal beliefs as a Catholic. By pushing for this amendment, he's showing that he's favoring one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any real reason for this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In the end, I've said what I think, and I don't think there's anything more to add.",
            "Okay, let's start from the beginning - I think the US government was not completely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq, and I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks in a way that wasn't entirely justified. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion in 2003. Personally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the invasion of Iraq was a repeat of some of the mistakes made in the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The American government didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the power vacuum that followed. They were trying to establish a democratic government, but it's a complex and difficult process that takes years, as we saw in our own country's struggle for democracy.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the transition would be smooth and easy, but it's been a long and hard ordeal. We're still in Iraq, and it's been almost the year 2007, with many American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their own country. I think the government was naive to think it would be a short and successful stay, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make to continue the war, especially when we've been there for so long. Once you're in, it's hard to just leave, especially since we're the ones who took away their government and way of life. However, it's also hard to keep risking the lives of American soldiers for what seems like an endless war. The real reason we're focusing on Iraq, I think, is because of the significant oil resources there and the desire to control them.\n\nI'm also concerned that the US government isn't being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. They claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found, and yet we're not taking action against other countries with known WMDs, like North Korea. I just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it seems unlikely.",
            "Okay, let's see... I'm all for gay marriage; I've always been. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and research has increasingly shown that it's biological rather than a product of social influences. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights due to something that's not within their control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think governments or politics should have a say in this; it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their households. Take my neighborhood, for instance, where there are a few openly gay couples living together. They function just like any other family, and it's hard to see why their relationships should be treated differently. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush would try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it according to their own whims.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard from various sources, there's evidence that being gay may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. For example, if someone grows up with four sisters and no father figure, that doesn't necessarily determine their sexual orientation.\n\nIn any case, it seems that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a major public spectacle, splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've dealt with this before. Once you put something on the internet, you can't take it back. It influences how people perceive you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. It's only a matter of time before someone sees it and shares it. Since the internet is public domain, even if it's a private profile, your friends on Myspace will receive the bulletin. In this case, it wasn't the school that received it, but someone who was concerned enough to report it. The school can't just ignore it, as they have a responsibility to act on potential threats to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nI understand that some people might just be joking around, but it's hard to tell what's a joke and what's not. It's like that situation we had at school, where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's friend checked their Facebook and was worried about some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone. When you post something online, you're essentially giving up your right to privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to it. While I think it's a bad idea for school officials to be friends with their students on social media, if something is brought to their attention, they can't just ignore it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you've given access to your online profile reports something that could pose a threat. If it's a genuine concern, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also believe that teachers shouldn't create fake social media accounts to keep an eye on their students. That's just not their place. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, especially if they're posting about activities I'm not supposed to be aware of. I don't want that kind of responsibility or the potential conflict that comes with it.",
            "I feel like this war has been dragging on for far too long. Initially, I believed the goal was commendable – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective and are now fighting for our own sake, proving our status as a world power. The original motivation, tied to George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, raises questions about its validity. If the intention was genuinely to introduce democracy to a nation lacking a fair system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that's the case.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the early stages of the war – it was a statement in itself. But the prolonged duration, spanning over a year and more, is excessive. If our original goal was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a noble cause. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, with it seeming that we're fighting just to be at war.\n\nI do believe it's time to bring this to an end. The Iraqi government will eventually have to fend for themselves; our continued involvement is draining our economy, with billions of dollars being spent on a war that's lost its purpose. We have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public roads, and healthcare, which could be better funded with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's disheartening to see our citizens being killed in a war that's no longer serving its intended purpose.",
            "I was wondering if I could get a clarification on something, but I guess it's kind of a complex issue. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like a certain situation. I'm not sure if that's an invasion of privacy, but I think it's worth exploring. On sites like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. You have to be a member to access someone's profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to see your stuff. It's the same with any information you put online - you have to be aware that lots of people will see it. In this case, I think it's a good thing that someone saw that info and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, I can see why it might be tough to have someone constantly monitoring people's profiles, especially if it's discriminatory. It's not right to single out certain individuals, and it's not feasible to have someone's job be to browse through everyone's profiles. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking or were they actively searching for something? I'm not sure.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a documentary about someone who showed how easy it is to get information online, and it was pretty disturbing. They were able to get a girl's screen name and meet with her in under a minute. It's hard because you think you're safe, but you're not. I've had people from my classes IM me, even though they don't know my real name. They know what I look like, my interests, and even my class schedule. I try to limit what I put online, but it's a tricky balance between keeping it private and being able to communicate with friends.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she told me about a situation in her high school where students were banned from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the power to do that, and it seems like a privacy issue to me. I don't know if I agree with it, but it's definitely an interesting topic to consider.",
            "I'm thinking about the Iraq War, and I'm hesitant to express my opinion because I feel like I'm just jumping on a bandwagon.  However, my initial stance against the war still stands, and I'm not just following the crowd. \n\nThe fact that most of the world shares my opinion is undeniable.  Polls have consistently shown that around seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide believe that the war was a mistake.  This includes a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it's a bad idea and want us to withdraw within a year.  It's clear that the situation has been a disaster from the beginning, and we're struggling to find a way out.\n\nThe cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem to be a significant obstacle.  We have a vastly different understanding of how to govern and live in a society, and trying to impose our system on them isn't working out.  I think it's naive to believe that we can bring democracy to a region where it's not wanted.  Saddam Hussein was certainly a bad guy, but we need to consider the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a quagmire.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.  I'm not buying into the administration's ideas about why we should stay, and I haven't heard a convincing argument for it.  If they want to withdraw gradually over the course of a year or more, I'd be okay with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now.  It's worth noting that a significant portion of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and even more think we should leave immediately.  These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight.\n\nIf we asked them if we should stay, and they said no, it would be hard to argue with their decision.  If things go wrong after we leave, we can at least say that it was their decision, not ours.  If we choose to help them after that, we might be seen as the good guys, but let's be realistic – we'll never be seen as heroes in the Middle East.  All we can do is try to minimize the damage and get out as soon as possible.",
            "I completely agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, though - certain industries and societal norms can make it tough for both men and women to succeed. In many careers, women face a 'glass ceiling' where, despite being qualified, they're overlooked for promotions due to historical biases. This isn't unique to women, though; men in non-traditional roles like stay-at-home dads also face prejudice. People often assume men should be the primary breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home are judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men who are genuinely interested in fashion are often taken less seriously because their interests don't fit traditional male stereotypes. \n\nThis slow change is partly due to the deeply ingrained mindset in society. Although we've made significant progress since the 1800s, it's still a long way to go. However, I believe we're moving in the right direction. Women are breaking through glass ceilings and becoming CEOs, and people are becoming more accepting of stay-at-home dads. As a result, we're starting to see a shift in how we view these non-traditional roles. To promote further change, we need to showcase the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped against. Rather than forcing it, which can lead to resistance, we should highlight their capabilities in a subtle yet effective way. I think we're at a good point where we're starting to see the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and regions can face discrimination based on their upbringing, education, or accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional education background might be judged by those with more 'refined' speech or education. This is another example of how various factors can contribute to discrimination, not just gender. \n\nI'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that hasn't already been done. If we push too hard for change, people might resist, and progress would be slowed. We need to find a balance between promoting equality and respecting people's differences. Our slow but steady progress is a step in the right direction, and I'm hopeful that we'll continue to move forward.",
            "I think it's been clarified that marijuana wasn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but more like a traffic ticket. If someone gets caught and cited, it's unlikely to have severe consequences in the long run, especially when it comes to things like job interviews. However, even with decriminalization, there are still concerns about the potential repercussions, which can be a major worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a valid argument that arresting people for marijuana possession is costly for cities, from the initial arrest to court appearances and public defenders. This can be a significant financial burden, especially for municipalities struggling financially. Even so, some cities are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community programs.\n\nDenver, however, is a different story. Given its more open-minded and progressive attitude, I think it's perfectly fine that they've decriminalized marijuana. The extra funding can be used for things like public education, social programs for seniors, and food programs for the homeless. It's not a straightforward decision, as there are valid reasons to be cautious about marijuana being everywhere, but there's also a financial aspect to consider.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it's possible that it could become as prevalent as cigarettes, which could lead to people smoking and driving, and other issues. It's still a bit taboo in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward for some people. While I'm not sure what I would think about that, I do know that marijuana can have different effects on people, just like alcohol. Some people can handle it better than others, and it's hard to generalize how people will react.\n\nI think both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's essential to acknowledge that people respond differently to substances. Some people can be more moderate, while others might not be able to control their consumption. It's a complex issue, but I do believe that both substances have their own unique consequences.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to making some changes because a lot of the practices are quite traditional. They've stuck to the same methods for a long time, and it's good to have roots in tradition. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church can be quite rigid in its expectations and doesn't accept people who don't live up to their doctrine perfectly. They also tend to be quite exclusive when it comes to people from other religions, like my parents, who are Episcopalians. They refused to let my parents get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's background.\n\nThis isn't exactly what you'd call being tolerant of other faiths. We're taught to love others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say that and not practice it. I think the Catholic Church's doctrine often conflicts with its practices, which can be quite outdated. They stick to their traditional ways even when they're no longer relevant.\n\nI don't think my personal views would necessarily change the situation, but personally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to get married. However, I'm not convinced that this would deter priests who engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a different issue altogether, and people who would do such things would probably do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIt's worth noting that people who abuse children tend to do so because of the power imbalance, not because of their marital status. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily stop these kinds of incidents from happening. It's unlikely that this would make a significant difference.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this issue, and I'm not sure if there's a right or wrong side to take. What I do know is that this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with right now. The line between separating church and state is a delicate one, and defining marriage is a sensitive matter that can be tricky to navigate without offending anyone. \n\nI'm thinking that maybe we should look at all civil unions as just that – a union between two people, without the government looking into whether it was a religious or secular ceremony. I mean, if it's just about two people coming together, then why should the government care what kind of marriage it is? It's about the bond between the individuals, not about what the government thinks of it. \n\nThe thing is, if gay marriage is seen as just another type of civil union, then it shouldn't be a problem. It's all about two people coming together, and that's what counts. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it would be great if we could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage through a constitutional amendment is extreme – it's not the kind of thing that should be decided by amending the constitution.\n\nI just don't think it's worth altering the constitution for a cause that's not big enough. It's a serious issue for some people, but it's not something that should warrant changing the foundation of our country. It's just not that important to define and ban gay marriage by amending the constitution. Let's keep it simple – it's about two people coming together. \n\nI don't know, but that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, where things got a bit hazy when it came to homosexuality. Having lots of gay friends made me think a lot about this issue, and I didn't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, but I do think it should be legalized. I think it's crazy to make it a national issue, and instead, each state should have its own say. It's like, some states are super liberal and others are more conservative, so I don't think the president should impose their views on everyone. If you live in a state that's liberal, you know how they feel about it, and if you don't like it, maybe you shouldn't move there. I think everyone should have the same opportunities, so it should be up to each state to decide. I already kind of said that, but yeah. I don't think it's right that Bush can decide for the whole country that gay marriage is against the law. He shouldn't get to dictate how each state runs itself. I mean, he's not gonna be in office forever, and if a new president comes in and thinks differently, the ban will just be lifted and then put back on again. It's simpler to just let each state decide for themselves, since they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, let me start again. I don't agree with the idea that the school acted unreasonably. I was thinking about this, and it seems like the school's actions might have been justified. Myspace is a public platform, and anything posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. Even if the post wasn't made under the school's name, officials could still access it from their homes. If going through Myspace can prevent a school shooting, which is the school's responsibility, then I think it's perfectly fine.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to monitor student behavior, like whether they're drinking or smoking. They're doing it to catch students and get them in trouble, which I think is an invasion of privacy. However, if it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion at all. It's a bit like if they searched homes to prevent a school shooting; it's all about keeping students safe.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express myself when writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that posting on Myspace is a public thing, and students shouldn't be surprised if they get in trouble. I'm cautious about posting stuff online, even emails, because you never know who might see it. If you do something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the consequences. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials can see it because it's a public platform.\n\nIf you do something wrong in college and grow up to be an important person, an old email can still come back to haunt you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials are doing it to make the school safer. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that they have to ensure the school is safe, like during lockdowns and drills.\n\nIn this case, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, which is their responsibility. They were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. So, I think they acted reasonably. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the war and our involvement in it. To be honest, my initial reaction was to support it after 9/11, which had a huge impact on me personally. I thought we should take action and show them the same level of devastation they brought to us. However, over time, I've come to realize that we jumped into this without a clear plan or understanding of the long-term consequences. \n\nUnfortunately, I think that's exactly what led to our problems. When emotions are running high, we tend to overlook the bigger picture. We went in there unprepared, not knowing what to expect, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nTo be frank, I've lost interest in the whole situation. As long as the people over there are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to focus on fighting us. It's quite evident that we're not making a difference; they're too busy infighting to care about us. Sometimes it feels like they're not even human, the way they conduct war. It's savage and brutal, and I don't think they're fighting for the betterment of their country – they just want us out.\n\nI think we should've taken a step back and thought this through before getting involved. We were driven by a desire for revenge, and President Bush declared war on Iraq largely in response to public sentiment. At the time, I understood his position, but now I believe we could've handled it differently. We were too focused on the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and we didn't have a clear plan for what we wanted to achieve in Iraq. \n\nIf we had unified our goals and strategies, we might have avoided some of the chaos we're seeing today. But that wasn't the case, and now I think we're stuck in a situation that's not working for us. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the people of Iraq; they're too entrenched in their ways, and we'll never be able to bring about lasting change.\n\nAs it stands, I don't think we're making enough progress to justify our continued presence in Iraq. We've achieved some things, but not enough to justify the costs. Once we leave, the situation will likely collapse, and we'll just be hurting ourselves by staying any longer. It's time to reassess our involvement and consider pulling out. That's my two cents on the matter."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to rethink some of its stances and make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. They have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated in my opinion. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, they might not be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and I think that's because they feel the Church is on the wrong side.\n\nI mean, if you're in favor of abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. And if you're gay or support gay marriage, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests – it's not like it would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe they would have done things differently, but it's hard to say.\n\nOne thing I do think the Church should reconsider is its stance on priests being allowed to be married. They say priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's a pretty unique job situation. Everyone else with a job has both a career and a personal life – so, I don't see why priests can't have both too.",
            "Honestly, I wanted to take a moment to clarify my thoughts on a sensitive topic. I've been considering this issue, and I don't think I'm opposed to the idea of gay marriage. It seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it would be unfair to hold gay people accountable for their natural inclinations.\n\nWhen I think about it, it doesn't seem right that society would deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their orientation. I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, but my gut feeling is that it's wrong for anyone to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they can control, just like how I'm naturally straight and others are naturally gay. It's not a choice that I think they should be held accountable for.\n\nTo me, it's clear that the federal government shouldn't involve themselves in this issue. It's not really a matter of the law, and it's certainly not a moral issue in my opinion. I don't think they have the right to dictate who can and can't get married based on something as personal as their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's a sensitive topic, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable discussing it, but I do think the federal government should stay out of it. It's not their place to interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as who they love. It's just not something they should be involved in.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. A lot of people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not true. It's two different things, you can't compare them. They're like two sides of the same coin - one isn't better than the other. People have the right to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, which are often denied to gay couples because they're not considered 'family'. It's crazy that if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't even be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. That's pretty shallow if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples. It's basically the same thing - a relationship is a relationship, and that's what matters. The problem is that people get hung up on the idea that gay couples want to get married in a church, but that's not true. They just want a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are treated unfairly, and it's not right. They have the same relationship dynamics, the same roles, and the same goals as straight couples. People worry about adoption and community issues, but those are separate problems. They're worried about how gay couples will affect their community, and how children of gay couples will turn out. But it's not that simple.\n\nIn New York City, for example, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. It's not fair. And it shows that the real issue is not the parents, but the society we live in. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples, and it's all about personal choices. The government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage, which align with his views on abortion and stem cell research, but that's not a good reason to deny people their rights. Morality is subjective, and it's not okay to impose someone's morality on the rest of the country. It's hypocritical to allow some people to enforce their religious views on everyone else. People are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect, but that's not supported by science. The American Psychological Association has disproven those claims, and it's time to listen to experts, not just popular opinion.",
            "Okay, so one thing - I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, people often think that just because something is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't have its good qualities. I mean, take it from a medical perspective. If a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it can't be beneficial. I'm not saying it should be available to the general public, no way, that's not where I'm coming from. But for medicinal purposes, I definitely think it's a different story. We don't use illegal substances in pharmacies because they're bad, but because they have benefits that we can harness.\n\nI mean, take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets - they're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Just because there's a stigma surrounding marijuana doesn't mean we should ignore its potential benefits. I think we should be open to its advantages, not dismiss it because of its current status.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is similar to alcohol in terms of abuse potential - while abusing either substance can lead to problems, marijuana's impact is different. I think we should approach its legalization gradually, but not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to get rid of the negative image surrounding marijuana. People have a skewed view of it because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made efforts to adapt to the modern era, becoming less strict than it used to be. Even from my own experience of attending church every Sunday as a kid, I've noticed the changes. I used to get all dressed up in cute outfits and go to a private school where I'd see my friends on the weekends. But now, especially during the summer, people show up to mass in casual beachwear, and even the morning masses are more relaxed, with people wearing jeans or khakis. It's definitely become a more casual atmosphere, which I think is a natural progression.\n\nAs for the bigger picture, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the problems with pedophilia in the Catholic Church. There are married individuals who still have a twisted attraction to young kids, and it's not solely because of their marital status. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should consider whether they can commit to the lifestyle. Some other religions, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church, allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's impossible to balance faith and marriage in this way.\n\nI think the root of the issue is that pedophilia is often an inborn trait, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing or environment. While genetics might play a role, you can't hide it through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's despicable, but I don't think that's always the case.\n\nOverall, the church's changes haven't had a significant impact on preventing these problems. My thoughts on the matter are that it's a complex issue, and I don't have any other specific opinions about the Catholic Church beyond that.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I believe that going to Iraq was partly a pretext. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but that turned out to be false. This whole thing bothered me, and the Iraq war really gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell, who presented that big UN speech, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious offense - lying to the public like that is unacceptable. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution and has been working to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they had a plan to go to war from the start.\n\nOne thing that really stands out is how the younger Bush seemed to have a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's past dealings with him, and I think he was also hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to reevaluate the situation, but withdrawing now could lead to even more problems, including a civil war that would result in more deaths. The current alternative being considered is a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to stabilize the country. However, I'm not sure that's the best idea, as it could create more problems in the long run, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The country's interim government is already showing signs of breaking down, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister has limited control, and radical elements are vying for power, causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know how to articulate my concerns in polite conversation.",
            "I'm still trying to process my thoughts about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's been a bit complicated for me. I think what's making it harder is that it wasn't even officially declared as a war. It just felt like a way to get back at someone after the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're stuck over there trying to build a democracy, which is a long-term goal, and also to get access to their resources. But the thing is, it's causing a lot of problems and making people upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to deal with the aftermath of trying to create a democracy, which won't happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing things up and having to start over. I'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nTo be honest, I'm really struggling to form an opinion on this. It's a complex topic, and I don't think I fully understand it. I think we should talk more about this and get a better grasp on the situation.\n\nI've been thinking, and I don't think we should call it a war anymore. It was never officially declared, and it's just become a way to show off our military strength. I think that's not the point of it all. It's about helping people, not just flexing our muscles.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but at the same time, we're wasting our resources, and it's making the President look bad. I'm not sure how much longer we can justify staying there. It's kind of like the Vietnam War – it was an undeclared war, and now it's considered a pointless war. I don't want our President to be known as the one who started a meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are people I know who have family members over there, and I want them to be safe. But at the same time, I don't want us to be there because it's messing with their culture and way of life. We're trying to change them into something they're not, and it's just making things worse. I think we're actually making the Al-Kaida problem worse by trying to impose our own values on them.\n\nI think this whole thing is going to drag on for years and years, and I'm not sure what the outcome will be. I guess that's just my two cents on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state to declare something as legal or to make laws about it. In my opinion, that's a decision that should be left to the churches. The constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any form of state control over this issue would be a direct defiance of what's already been written.\n\nI think people trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with some areas like Boston being exceptions. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't dictate as right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think making an amendment to restrict this would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict people's rights rather than the government's, and I don't believe that's right.\n\nTo me, the government should stay out of this issue altogether. I don't see why there's a push for this amendment, except that it's against the president's own personal beliefs as a Catholic. By pushing for this amendment, he's showing that he's favoring one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any real reason for this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In the end, I've said what I think, and I don't think there's anything more to add.",
            "Okay, let's start from the beginning - I think the US government was not completely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq, and I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks in a way that wasn't entirely justified. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion in 2003. Personally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the invasion of Iraq was a repeat of some of the mistakes made in the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The American government didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the power vacuum that followed. They were trying to establish a democratic government, but it's a complex and difficult process that takes years, as we saw in our own country's struggle for democracy.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the transition would be smooth and easy, but it's been a long and hard ordeal. We're still in Iraq, and it's been almost the year 2007, with many American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their own country. I think the government was naive to think it would be a short and successful stay, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make to continue the war, especially when we've been there for so long. Once you're in, it's hard to just leave, especially since we're the ones who took away their government and way of life. However, it's also hard to keep risking the lives of American soldiers for what seems like an endless war. The real reason we're focusing on Iraq, I think, is because of the significant oil resources there and the desire to control them.\n\nI'm also concerned that the US government isn't being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. They claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found, and yet we're not taking action against other countries with known WMDs, like North Korea. I just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it seems unlikely.",
            "Okay, let's see... I'm all for gay marriage; I've always been. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and research has increasingly shown that it's biological rather than a product of social influences. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights due to something that's not within their control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think governments or politics should have a say in this; it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their households. Take my neighborhood, for instance, where there are a few openly gay couples living together. They function just like any other family, and it's hard to see why their relationships should be treated differently. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush would try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it according to their own whims.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard from various sources, there's evidence that being gay may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. For example, if someone grows up with four sisters and no father figure, that doesn't necessarily determine their sexual orientation.\n\nIn any case, it seems that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a major public spectacle, splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've dealt with this before. Once you put something on the internet, you can't take it back. It influences how people perceive you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. It's only a matter of time before someone sees it and shares it. Since the internet is public domain, even if it's a private profile, your friends on Myspace will receive the bulletin. In this case, it wasn't the school that received it, but someone who was concerned enough to report it. The school can't just ignore it, as they have a responsibility to act on potential threats to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nI understand that some people might just be joking around, but it's hard to tell what's a joke and what's not. It's like that situation we had at school, where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's friend checked their Facebook and was worried about some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone. When you post something online, you're essentially giving up your right to privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to it. While I think it's a bad idea for school officials to be friends with their students on social media, if something is brought to their attention, they can't just ignore it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you've given access to your online profile reports something that could pose a threat. If it's a genuine concern, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also believe that teachers shouldn't create fake social media accounts to keep an eye on their students. That's just not their place. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, especially if they're posting about activities I'm not supposed to be aware of. I don't want that kind of responsibility or the potential conflict that comes with it.",
            "I feel like this war has been dragging on for far too long. Initially, I believed the goal was commendable – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective and are now fighting for our own sake, proving our status as a world power. The original motivation, tied to George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, raises questions about its validity. If the intention was genuinely to introduce democracy to a nation lacking a fair system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that's the case.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the early stages of the war – it was a statement in itself. But the prolonged duration, spanning over a year and more, is excessive. If our original goal was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a noble cause. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, with it seeming that we're fighting just to be at war.\n\nI do believe it's time to bring this to an end. The Iraqi government will eventually have to fend for themselves; our continued involvement is draining our economy, with billions of dollars being spent on a war that's lost its purpose. We have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public roads, and healthcare, which could be better funded with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's disheartening to see our citizens being killed in a war that's no longer serving its intended purpose.",
            "I was wondering if I could get a clarification on something, but I guess it's kind of a complex issue. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like a certain situation. I'm not sure if that's an invasion of privacy, but I think it's worth exploring. On sites like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. You have to be a member to access someone's profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to see your stuff. It's the same with any information you put online - you have to be aware that lots of people will see it. In this case, I think it's a good thing that someone saw that info and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, I can see why it might be tough to have someone constantly monitoring people's profiles, especially if it's discriminatory. It's not right to single out certain individuals, and it's not feasible to have someone's job be to browse through everyone's profiles. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking or were they actively searching for something? I'm not sure.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a documentary about someone who showed how easy it is to get information online, and it was pretty disturbing. They were able to get a girl's screen name and meet with her in under a minute. It's hard because you think you're safe, but you're not. I've had people from my classes IM me, even though they don't know my real name. They know what I look like, my interests, and even my class schedule. I try to limit what I put online, but it's a tricky balance between keeping it private and being able to communicate with friends.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she told me about a situation in her high school where students were banned from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the power to do that, and it seems like a privacy issue to me. I don't know if I agree with it, but it's definitely an interesting topic to consider.",
            "I'm thinking about the Iraq War, and I'm hesitant to express my opinion because I feel like I'm just jumping on a bandwagon.  However, my initial stance against the war still stands, and I'm not just following the crowd. \n\nThe fact that most of the world shares my opinion is undeniable.  Polls have consistently shown that around seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide believe that the war was a mistake.  This includes a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it's a bad idea and want us to withdraw within a year.  It's clear that the situation has been a disaster from the beginning, and we're struggling to find a way out.\n\nThe cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem to be a significant obstacle.  We have a vastly different understanding of how to govern and live in a society, and trying to impose our system on them isn't working out.  I think it's naive to believe that we can bring democracy to a region where it's not wanted.  Saddam Hussein was certainly a bad guy, but we need to consider the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a quagmire.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.  I'm not buying into the administration's ideas about why we should stay, and I haven't heard a convincing argument for it.  If they want to withdraw gradually over the course of a year or more, I'd be okay with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now.  It's worth noting that a significant portion of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and even more think we should leave immediately.  These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight.\n\nIf we asked them if we should stay, and they said no, it would be hard to argue with their decision.  If things go wrong after we leave, we can at least say that it was their decision, not ours.  If we choose to help them after that, we might be seen as the good guys, but let's be realistic – we'll never be seen as heroes in the Middle East.  All we can do is try to minimize the damage and get out as soon as possible.",
            "I completely agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, though - certain industries and societal norms can make it tough for both men and women to succeed. In many careers, women face a 'glass ceiling' where, despite being qualified, they're overlooked for promotions due to historical biases. This isn't unique to women, though; men in non-traditional roles like stay-at-home dads also face prejudice. People often assume men should be the primary breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home are judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men who are genuinely interested in fashion are often taken less seriously because their interests don't fit traditional male stereotypes. \n\nThis slow change is partly due to the deeply ingrained mindset in society. Although we've made significant progress since the 1800s, it's still a long way to go. However, I believe we're moving in the right direction. Women are breaking through glass ceilings and becoming CEOs, and people are becoming more accepting of stay-at-home dads. As a result, we're starting to see a shift in how we view these non-traditional roles. To promote further change, we need to showcase the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped against. Rather than forcing it, which can lead to resistance, we should highlight their capabilities in a subtle yet effective way. I think we're at a good point where we're starting to see the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and regions can face discrimination based on their upbringing, education, or accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional education background might be judged by those with more 'refined' speech or education. This is another example of how various factors can contribute to discrimination, not just gender. \n\nI'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that hasn't already been done. If we push too hard for change, people might resist, and progress would be slowed. We need to find a balance between promoting equality and respecting people's differences. Our slow but steady progress is a step in the right direction, and I'm hopeful that we'll continue to move forward.",
            "I think it's been clarified that marijuana wasn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but more like a traffic ticket. If someone gets caught and cited, it's unlikely to have severe consequences in the long run, especially when it comes to things like job interviews. However, even with decriminalization, there are still concerns about the potential repercussions, which can be a major worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a valid argument that arresting people for marijuana possession is costly for cities, from the initial arrest to court appearances and public defenders. This can be a significant financial burden, especially for municipalities struggling financially. Even so, some cities are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community programs.\n\nDenver, however, is a different story. Given its more open-minded and progressive attitude, I think it's perfectly fine that they've decriminalized marijuana. The extra funding can be used for things like public education, social programs for seniors, and food programs for the homeless. It's not a straightforward decision, as there are valid reasons to be cautious about marijuana being everywhere, but there's also a financial aspect to consider.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it's possible that it could become as prevalent as cigarettes, which could lead to people smoking and driving, and other issues. It's still a bit taboo in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward for some people. While I'm not sure what I would think about that, I do know that marijuana can have different effects on people, just like alcohol. Some people can handle it better than others, and it's hard to generalize how people will react.\n\nI think both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's essential to acknowledge that people respond differently to substances. Some people can be more moderate, while others might not be able to control their consumption. It's a complex issue, but I do believe that both substances have their own unique consequences.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to making some changes because a lot of the practices are quite traditional. They've stuck to the same methods for a long time, and it's good to have roots in tradition. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church can be quite rigid in its expectations and doesn't accept people who don't live up to their doctrine perfectly. They also tend to be quite exclusive when it comes to people from other religions, like my parents, who are Episcopalians. They refused to let my parents get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's background.\n\nThis isn't exactly what you'd call being tolerant of other faiths. We're taught to love others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say that and not practice it. I think the Catholic Church's doctrine often conflicts with its practices, which can be quite outdated. They stick to their traditional ways even when they're no longer relevant.\n\nI don't think my personal views would necessarily change the situation, but personally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to get married. However, I'm not convinced that this would deter priests who engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a different issue altogether, and people who would do such things would probably do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIt's worth noting that people who abuse children tend to do so because of the power imbalance, not because of their marital status. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily stop these kinds of incidents from happening. It's unlikely that this would make a significant difference.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this issue, and I'm not sure if there's a right or wrong side to take. What I do know is that this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with right now. The line between separating church and state is a delicate one, and defining marriage is a sensitive matter that can be tricky to navigate without offending anyone. \n\nI'm thinking that maybe we should look at all civil unions as just that – a union between two people, without the government looking into whether it was a religious or secular ceremony. I mean, if it's just about two people coming together, then why should the government care what kind of marriage it is? It's about the bond between the individuals, not about what the government thinks of it. \n\nThe thing is, if gay marriage is seen as just another type of civil union, then it shouldn't be a problem. It's all about two people coming together, and that's what counts. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it would be great if we could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage through a constitutional amendment is extreme – it's not the kind of thing that should be decided by amending the constitution.\n\nI just don't think it's worth altering the constitution for a cause that's not big enough. It's a serious issue for some people, but it's not something that should warrant changing the foundation of our country. It's just not that important to define and ban gay marriage by amending the constitution. Let's keep it simple – it's about two people coming together. \n\nI don't know, but that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, where things got a bit hazy when it came to homosexuality. Having lots of gay friends made me think a lot about this issue, and I didn't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, but I do think it should be legalized. I think it's crazy to make it a national issue, and instead, each state should have its own say. It's like, some states are super liberal and others are more conservative, so I don't think the president should impose their views on everyone. If you live in a state that's liberal, you know how they feel about it, and if you don't like it, maybe you shouldn't move there. I think everyone should have the same opportunities, so it should be up to each state to decide. I already kind of said that, but yeah. I don't think it's right that Bush can decide for the whole country that gay marriage is against the law. He shouldn't get to dictate how each state runs itself. I mean, he's not gonna be in office forever, and if a new president comes in and thinks differently, the ban will just be lifted and then put back on again. It's simpler to just let each state decide for themselves, since they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, let me start again. I don't agree with the idea that the school acted unreasonably. I was thinking about this, and it seems like the school's actions might have been justified. Myspace is a public platform, and anything posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. Even if the post wasn't made under the school's name, officials could still access it from their homes. If going through Myspace can prevent a school shooting, which is the school's responsibility, then I think it's perfectly fine.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to monitor student behavior, like whether they're drinking or smoking. They're doing it to catch students and get them in trouble, which I think is an invasion of privacy. However, if it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion at all. It's a bit like if they searched homes to prevent a school shooting; it's all about keeping students safe.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express myself when writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that posting on Myspace is a public thing, and students shouldn't be surprised if they get in trouble. I'm cautious about posting stuff online, even emails, because you never know who might see it. If you do something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the consequences. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials can see it because it's a public platform.\n\nIf you do something wrong in college and grow up to be an important person, an old email can still come back to haunt you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials are doing it to make the school safer. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that they have to ensure the school is safe, like during lockdowns and drills.\n\nIn this case, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, which is their responsibility. They were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. So, I think they acted reasonably. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the war and our involvement in it. To be honest, my initial reaction was to support it after 9/11, which had a huge impact on me personally. I thought we should take action and show them the same level of devastation they brought to us. However, over time, I've come to realize that we jumped into this without a clear plan or understanding of the long-term consequences. \n\nUnfortunately, I think that's exactly what led to our problems. When emotions are running high, we tend to overlook the bigger picture. We went in there unprepared, not knowing what to expect, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nTo be frank, I've lost interest in the whole situation. As long as the people over there are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to focus on fighting us. It's quite evident that we're not making a difference; they're too busy infighting to care about us. Sometimes it feels like they're not even human, the way they conduct war. It's savage and brutal, and I don't think they're fighting for the betterment of their country – they just want us out.\n\nI think we should've taken a step back and thought this through before getting involved. We were driven by a desire for revenge, and President Bush declared war on Iraq largely in response to public sentiment. At the time, I understood his position, but now I believe we could've handled it differently. We were too focused on the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and we didn't have a clear plan for what we wanted to achieve in Iraq. \n\nIf we had unified our goals and strategies, we might have avoided some of the chaos we're seeing today. But that wasn't the case, and now I think we're stuck in a situation that's not working for us. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the people of Iraq; they're too entrenched in their ways, and we'll never be able to bring about lasting change.\n\nAs it stands, I don't think we're making enough progress to justify our continued presence in Iraq. We've achieved some things, but not enough to justify the costs. Once we leave, the situation will likely collapse, and we'll just be hurting ourselves by staying any longer. It's time to reassess our involvement and consider pulling out. That's my two cents on the matter."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to rethink some of its stances and make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. They have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated in my opinion. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, they might not be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and I think that's because they feel the Church is on the wrong side.\n\nI mean, if you're in favor of abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. And if you're gay or support gay marriage, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests – it's not like it would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe they would have done things differently, but it's hard to say.\n\nOne thing I do think the Church should reconsider is its stance on priests being allowed to be married. They say priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's a pretty unique job situation. Everyone else with a job has both a career and a personal life – so, I don't see why priests can't have both too.",
            "Honestly, I wanted to take a moment to clarify my thoughts on a sensitive topic. I've been considering this issue, and I don't think I'm opposed to the idea of gay marriage. It seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it would be unfair to hold gay people accountable for their natural inclinations.\n\nWhen I think about it, it doesn't seem right that society would deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their orientation. I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, but my gut feeling is that it's wrong for anyone to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they can control, just like how I'm naturally straight and others are naturally gay. It's not a choice that I think they should be held accountable for.\n\nTo me, it's clear that the federal government shouldn't involve themselves in this issue. It's not really a matter of the law, and it's certainly not a moral issue in my opinion. I don't think they have the right to dictate who can and can't get married based on something as personal as their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's a sensitive topic, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable discussing it, but I do think the federal government should stay out of it. It's not their place to interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as who they love. It's just not something they should be involved in.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. A lot of people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not true. It's two different things, you can't compare them. They're like two sides of the same coin - one isn't better than the other. People have the right to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, which are often denied to gay couples because they're not considered 'family'. It's crazy that if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't even be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. That's pretty shallow if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples. It's basically the same thing - a relationship is a relationship, and that's what matters. The problem is that people get hung up on the idea that gay couples want to get married in a church, but that's not true. They just want a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are treated unfairly, and it's not right. They have the same relationship dynamics, the same roles, and the same goals as straight couples. People worry about adoption and community issues, but those are separate problems. They're worried about how gay couples will affect their community, and how children of gay couples will turn out. But it's not that simple.\n\nIn New York City, for example, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. It's not fair. And it shows that the real issue is not the parents, but the society we live in. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples, and it's all about personal choices. The government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage, which align with his views on abortion and stem cell research, but that's not a good reason to deny people their rights. Morality is subjective, and it's not okay to impose someone's morality on the rest of the country. It's hypocritical to allow some people to enforce their religious views on everyone else. People are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect, but that's not supported by science. The American Psychological Association has disproven those claims, and it's time to listen to experts, not just popular opinion.",
            "Okay, so one thing - I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, people often think that just because something is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't have its good qualities. I mean, take it from a medical perspective. If a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it can't be beneficial. I'm not saying it should be available to the general public, no way, that's not where I'm coming from. But for medicinal purposes, I definitely think it's a different story. We don't use illegal substances in pharmacies because they're bad, but because they have benefits that we can harness.\n\nI mean, take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets - they're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Just because there's a stigma surrounding marijuana doesn't mean we should ignore its potential benefits. I think we should be open to its advantages, not dismiss it because of its current status.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is similar to alcohol in terms of abuse potential - while abusing either substance can lead to problems, marijuana's impact is different. I think we should approach its legalization gradually, but not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to get rid of the negative image surrounding marijuana. People have a skewed view of it because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made efforts to adapt to the modern era, becoming less strict than it used to be. Even from my own experience of attending church every Sunday as a kid, I've noticed the changes. I used to get all dressed up in cute outfits and go to a private school where I'd see my friends on the weekends. But now, especially during the summer, people show up to mass in casual beachwear, and even the morning masses are more relaxed, with people wearing jeans or khakis. It's definitely become a more casual atmosphere, which I think is a natural progression.\n\nAs for the bigger picture, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the problems with pedophilia in the Catholic Church. There are married individuals who still have a twisted attraction to young kids, and it's not solely because of their marital status. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should consider whether they can commit to the lifestyle. Some other religions, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church, allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's impossible to balance faith and marriage in this way.\n\nI think the root of the issue is that pedophilia is often an inborn trait, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing or environment. While genetics might play a role, you can't hide it through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's despicable, but I don't think that's always the case.\n\nOverall, the church's changes haven't had a significant impact on preventing these problems. My thoughts on the matter are that it's a complex issue, and I don't have any other specific opinions about the Catholic Church beyond that.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I believe that going to Iraq was partly a pretext. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but that turned out to be false. This whole thing bothered me, and the Iraq war really gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell, who presented that big UN speech, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious offense - lying to the public like that is unacceptable. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution and has been working to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they had a plan to go to war from the start.\n\nOne thing that really stands out is how the younger Bush seemed to have a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's past dealings with him, and I think he was also hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to reevaluate the situation, but withdrawing now could lead to even more problems, including a civil war that would result in more deaths. The current alternative being considered is a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to stabilize the country. However, I'm not sure that's the best idea, as it could create more problems in the long run, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The country's interim government is already showing signs of breaking down, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister has limited control, and radical elements are vying for power, causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know how to articulate my concerns in polite conversation.",
            "I'm still trying to process my thoughts about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's been a bit complicated for me. I think what's making it harder is that it wasn't even officially declared as a war. It just felt like a way to get back at someone after the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're stuck over there trying to build a democracy, which is a long-term goal, and also to get access to their resources. But the thing is, it's causing a lot of problems and making people upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to deal with the aftermath of trying to create a democracy, which won't happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing things up and having to start over. I'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nTo be honest, I'm really struggling to form an opinion on this. It's a complex topic, and I don't think I fully understand it. I think we should talk more about this and get a better grasp on the situation.\n\nI've been thinking, and I don't think we should call it a war anymore. It was never officially declared, and it's just become a way to show off our military strength. I think that's not the point of it all. It's about helping people, not just flexing our muscles.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but at the same time, we're wasting our resources, and it's making the President look bad. I'm not sure how much longer we can justify staying there. It's kind of like the Vietnam War – it was an undeclared war, and now it's considered a pointless war. I don't want our President to be known as the one who started a meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are people I know who have family members over there, and I want them to be safe. But at the same time, I don't want us to be there because it's messing with their culture and way of life. We're trying to change them into something they're not, and it's just making things worse. I think we're actually making the Al-Kaida problem worse by trying to impose our own values on them.\n\nI think this whole thing is going to drag on for years and years, and I'm not sure what the outcome will be. I guess that's just my two cents on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state to declare something as legal or to make laws about it. In my opinion, that's a decision that should be left to the churches. The constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any form of state control over this issue would be a direct defiance of what's already been written.\n\nI think people trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with some areas like Boston being exceptions. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't dictate as right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think making an amendment to restrict this would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict people's rights rather than the government's, and I don't believe that's right.\n\nTo me, the government should stay out of this issue altogether. I don't see why there's a push for this amendment, except that it's against the president's own personal beliefs as a Catholic. By pushing for this amendment, he's showing that he's favoring one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any real reason for this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In the end, I've said what I think, and I don't think there's anything more to add.",
            "Okay, let's start from the beginning - I think the US government was not completely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq, and I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks in a way that wasn't entirely justified. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion in 2003. Personally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the invasion of Iraq was a repeat of some of the mistakes made in the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The American government didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the power vacuum that followed. They were trying to establish a democratic government, but it's a complex and difficult process that takes years, as we saw in our own country's struggle for democracy.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the transition would be smooth and easy, but it's been a long and hard ordeal. We're still in Iraq, and it's been almost the year 2007, with many American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their own country. I think the government was naive to think it would be a short and successful stay, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make to continue the war, especially when we've been there for so long. Once you're in, it's hard to just leave, especially since we're the ones who took away their government and way of life. However, it's also hard to keep risking the lives of American soldiers for what seems like an endless war. The real reason we're focusing on Iraq, I think, is because of the significant oil resources there and the desire to control them.\n\nI'm also concerned that the US government isn't being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. They claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found, and yet we're not taking action against other countries with known WMDs, like North Korea. I just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it seems unlikely.",
            "Okay, let's see... I'm all for gay marriage; I've always been. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and research has increasingly shown that it's biological rather than a product of social influences. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights due to something that's not within their control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think governments or politics should have a say in this; it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their households. Take my neighborhood, for instance, where there are a few openly gay couples living together. They function just like any other family, and it's hard to see why their relationships should be treated differently. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush would try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it according to their own whims.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard from various sources, there's evidence that being gay may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. For example, if someone grows up with four sisters and no father figure, that doesn't necessarily determine their sexual orientation.\n\nIn any case, it seems that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a major public spectacle, splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've dealt with this before. Once you put something on the internet, you can't take it back. It influences how people perceive you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. It's only a matter of time before someone sees it and shares it. Since the internet is public domain, even if it's a private profile, your friends on Myspace will receive the bulletin. In this case, it wasn't the school that received it, but someone who was concerned enough to report it. The school can't just ignore it, as they have a responsibility to act on potential threats to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nI understand that some people might just be joking around, but it's hard to tell what's a joke and what's not. It's like that situation we had at school, where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's friend checked their Facebook and was worried about some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone. When you post something online, you're essentially giving up your right to privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to it. While I think it's a bad idea for school officials to be friends with their students on social media, if something is brought to their attention, they can't just ignore it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you've given access to your online profile reports something that could pose a threat. If it's a genuine concern, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also believe that teachers shouldn't create fake social media accounts to keep an eye on their students. That's just not their place. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, especially if they're posting about activities I'm not supposed to be aware of. I don't want that kind of responsibility or the potential conflict that comes with it.",
            "I feel like this war has been dragging on for far too long. Initially, I believed the goal was commendable – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective and are now fighting for our own sake, proving our status as a world power. The original motivation, tied to George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, raises questions about its validity. If the intention was genuinely to introduce democracy to a nation lacking a fair system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that's the case.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the early stages of the war – it was a statement in itself. But the prolonged duration, spanning over a year and more, is excessive. If our original goal was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a noble cause. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, with it seeming that we're fighting just to be at war.\n\nI do believe it's time to bring this to an end. The Iraqi government will eventually have to fend for themselves; our continued involvement is draining our economy, with billions of dollars being spent on a war that's lost its purpose. We have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public roads, and healthcare, which could be better funded with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's disheartening to see our citizens being killed in a war that's no longer serving its intended purpose.",
            "I was wondering if I could get a clarification on something, but I guess it's kind of a complex issue. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like a certain situation. I'm not sure if that's an invasion of privacy, but I think it's worth exploring. On sites like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. You have to be a member to access someone's profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to see your stuff. It's the same with any information you put online - you have to be aware that lots of people will see it. In this case, I think it's a good thing that someone saw that info and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, I can see why it might be tough to have someone constantly monitoring people's profiles, especially if it's discriminatory. It's not right to single out certain individuals, and it's not feasible to have someone's job be to browse through everyone's profiles. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking or were they actively searching for something? I'm not sure.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a documentary about someone who showed how easy it is to get information online, and it was pretty disturbing. They were able to get a girl's screen name and meet with her in under a minute. It's hard because you think you're safe, but you're not. I've had people from my classes IM me, even though they don't know my real name. They know what I look like, my interests, and even my class schedule. I try to limit what I put online, but it's a tricky balance between keeping it private and being able to communicate with friends.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she told me about a situation in her high school where students were banned from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the power to do that, and it seems like a privacy issue to me. I don't know if I agree with it, but it's definitely an interesting topic to consider.",
            "I'm thinking about the Iraq War, and I'm hesitant to express my opinion because I feel like I'm just jumping on a bandwagon.  However, my initial stance against the war still stands, and I'm not just following the crowd. \n\nThe fact that most of the world shares my opinion is undeniable.  Polls have consistently shown that around seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide believe that the war was a mistake.  This includes a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it's a bad idea and want us to withdraw within a year.  It's clear that the situation has been a disaster from the beginning, and we're struggling to find a way out.\n\nThe cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem to be a significant obstacle.  We have a vastly different understanding of how to govern and live in a society, and trying to impose our system on them isn't working out.  I think it's naive to believe that we can bring democracy to a region where it's not wanted.  Saddam Hussein was certainly a bad guy, but we need to consider the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a quagmire.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.  I'm not buying into the administration's ideas about why we should stay, and I haven't heard a convincing argument for it.  If they want to withdraw gradually over the course of a year or more, I'd be okay with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now.  It's worth noting that a significant portion of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and even more think we should leave immediately.  These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight.\n\nIf we asked them if we should stay, and they said no, it would be hard to argue with their decision.  If things go wrong after we leave, we can at least say that it was their decision, not ours.  If we choose to help them after that, we might be seen as the good guys, but let's be realistic – we'll never be seen as heroes in the Middle East.  All we can do is try to minimize the damage and get out as soon as possible.",
            "I completely agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, though - certain industries and societal norms can make it tough for both men and women to succeed. In many careers, women face a 'glass ceiling' where, despite being qualified, they're overlooked for promotions due to historical biases. This isn't unique to women, though; men in non-traditional roles like stay-at-home dads also face prejudice. People often assume men should be the primary breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home are judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men who are genuinely interested in fashion are often taken less seriously because their interests don't fit traditional male stereotypes. \n\nThis slow change is partly due to the deeply ingrained mindset in society. Although we've made significant progress since the 1800s, it's still a long way to go. However, I believe we're moving in the right direction. Women are breaking through glass ceilings and becoming CEOs, and people are becoming more accepting of stay-at-home dads. As a result, we're starting to see a shift in how we view these non-traditional roles. To promote further change, we need to showcase the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped against. Rather than forcing it, which can lead to resistance, we should highlight their capabilities in a subtle yet effective way. I think we're at a good point where we're starting to see the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and regions can face discrimination based on their upbringing, education, or accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional education background might be judged by those with more 'refined' speech or education. This is another example of how various factors can contribute to discrimination, not just gender. \n\nI'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that hasn't already been done. If we push too hard for change, people might resist, and progress would be slowed. We need to find a balance between promoting equality and respecting people's differences. Our slow but steady progress is a step in the right direction, and I'm hopeful that we'll continue to move forward.",
            "I think it's been clarified that marijuana wasn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but more like a traffic ticket. If someone gets caught and cited, it's unlikely to have severe consequences in the long run, especially when it comes to things like job interviews. However, even with decriminalization, there are still concerns about the potential repercussions, which can be a major worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a valid argument that arresting people for marijuana possession is costly for cities, from the initial arrest to court appearances and public defenders. This can be a significant financial burden, especially for municipalities struggling financially. Even so, some cities are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community programs.\n\nDenver, however, is a different story. Given its more open-minded and progressive attitude, I think it's perfectly fine that they've decriminalized marijuana. The extra funding can be used for things like public education, social programs for seniors, and food programs for the homeless. It's not a straightforward decision, as there are valid reasons to be cautious about marijuana being everywhere, but there's also a financial aspect to consider.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it's possible that it could become as prevalent as cigarettes, which could lead to people smoking and driving, and other issues. It's still a bit taboo in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward for some people. While I'm not sure what I would think about that, I do know that marijuana can have different effects on people, just like alcohol. Some people can handle it better than others, and it's hard to generalize how people will react.\n\nI think both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's essential to acknowledge that people respond differently to substances. Some people can be more moderate, while others might not be able to control their consumption. It's a complex issue, but I do believe that both substances have their own unique consequences.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to making some changes because a lot of the practices are quite traditional. They've stuck to the same methods for a long time, and it's good to have roots in tradition. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church can be quite rigid in its expectations and doesn't accept people who don't live up to their doctrine perfectly. They also tend to be quite exclusive when it comes to people from other religions, like my parents, who are Episcopalians. They refused to let my parents get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's background.\n\nThis isn't exactly what you'd call being tolerant of other faiths. We're taught to love others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say that and not practice it. I think the Catholic Church's doctrine often conflicts with its practices, which can be quite outdated. They stick to their traditional ways even when they're no longer relevant.\n\nI don't think my personal views would necessarily change the situation, but personally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to get married. However, I'm not convinced that this would deter priests who engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a different issue altogether, and people who would do such things would probably do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIt's worth noting that people who abuse children tend to do so because of the power imbalance, not because of their marital status. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily stop these kinds of incidents from happening. It's unlikely that this would make a significant difference.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this issue, and I'm not sure if there's a right or wrong side to take. What I do know is that this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with right now. The line between separating church and state is a delicate one, and defining marriage is a sensitive matter that can be tricky to navigate without offending anyone. \n\nI'm thinking that maybe we should look at all civil unions as just that – a union between two people, without the government looking into whether it was a religious or secular ceremony. I mean, if it's just about two people coming together, then why should the government care what kind of marriage it is? It's about the bond between the individuals, not about what the government thinks of it. \n\nThe thing is, if gay marriage is seen as just another type of civil union, then it shouldn't be a problem. It's all about two people coming together, and that's what counts. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it would be great if we could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage through a constitutional amendment is extreme – it's not the kind of thing that should be decided by amending the constitution.\n\nI just don't think it's worth altering the constitution for a cause that's not big enough. It's a serious issue for some people, but it's not something that should warrant changing the foundation of our country. It's just not that important to define and ban gay marriage by amending the constitution. Let's keep it simple – it's about two people coming together. \n\nI don't know, but that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, where things got a bit hazy when it came to homosexuality. Having lots of gay friends made me think a lot about this issue, and I didn't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, but I do think it should be legalized. I think it's crazy to make it a national issue, and instead, each state should have its own say. It's like, some states are super liberal and others are more conservative, so I don't think the president should impose their views on everyone. If you live in a state that's liberal, you know how they feel about it, and if you don't like it, maybe you shouldn't move there. I think everyone should have the same opportunities, so it should be up to each state to decide. I already kind of said that, but yeah. I don't think it's right that Bush can decide for the whole country that gay marriage is against the law. He shouldn't get to dictate how each state runs itself. I mean, he's not gonna be in office forever, and if a new president comes in and thinks differently, the ban will just be lifted and then put back on again. It's simpler to just let each state decide for themselves, since they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, let me start again. I don't agree with the idea that the school acted unreasonably. I was thinking about this, and it seems like the school's actions might have been justified. Myspace is a public platform, and anything posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. Even if the post wasn't made under the school's name, officials could still access it from their homes. If going through Myspace can prevent a school shooting, which is the school's responsibility, then I think it's perfectly fine.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to monitor student behavior, like whether they're drinking or smoking. They're doing it to catch students and get them in trouble, which I think is an invasion of privacy. However, if it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion at all. It's a bit like if they searched homes to prevent a school shooting; it's all about keeping students safe.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express myself when writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that posting on Myspace is a public thing, and students shouldn't be surprised if they get in trouble. I'm cautious about posting stuff online, even emails, because you never know who might see it. If you do something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the consequences. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials can see it because it's a public platform.\n\nIf you do something wrong in college and grow up to be an important person, an old email can still come back to haunt you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials are doing it to make the school safer. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that they have to ensure the school is safe, like during lockdowns and drills.\n\nIn this case, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, which is their responsibility. They were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. So, I think they acted reasonably. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the war and our involvement in it. To be honest, my initial reaction was to support it after 9/11, which had a huge impact on me personally. I thought we should take action and show them the same level of devastation they brought to us. However, over time, I've come to realize that we jumped into this without a clear plan or understanding of the long-term consequences. \n\nUnfortunately, I think that's exactly what led to our problems. When emotions are running high, we tend to overlook the bigger picture. We went in there unprepared, not knowing what to expect, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nTo be frank, I've lost interest in the whole situation. As long as the people over there are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to focus on fighting us. It's quite evident that we're not making a difference; they're too busy infighting to care about us. Sometimes it feels like they're not even human, the way they conduct war. It's savage and brutal, and I don't think they're fighting for the betterment of their country – they just want us out.\n\nI think we should've taken a step back and thought this through before getting involved. We were driven by a desire for revenge, and President Bush declared war on Iraq largely in response to public sentiment. At the time, I understood his position, but now I believe we could've handled it differently. We were too focused on the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and we didn't have a clear plan for what we wanted to achieve in Iraq. \n\nIf we had unified our goals and strategies, we might have avoided some of the chaos we're seeing today. But that wasn't the case, and now I think we're stuck in a situation that's not working for us. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the people of Iraq; they're too entrenched in their ways, and we'll never be able to bring about lasting change.\n\nAs it stands, I don't think we're making enough progress to justify our continued presence in Iraq. We've achieved some things, but not enough to justify the costs. Once we leave, the situation will likely collapse, and we'll just be hurting ourselves by staying any longer. It's time to reassess our involvement and consider pulling out. That's my two cents on the matter."
