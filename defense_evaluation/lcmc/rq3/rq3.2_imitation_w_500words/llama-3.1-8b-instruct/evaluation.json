            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some significant changes. They're losing followers, and it's largely because they're not very accepting of many things. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control is really outdated. While I understand that they have strong views on these topics, I believe that if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to reject the Church's views on these issues, and it's causing a lot of people to turn against them.\n\nIf you're someone who supports abortion or gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a community where these things are viewed as completely wrong. It's the same with other issues – if the Church doesn't agree with your values, you might not want to be part of their community. It's hard to see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think it would have prevented the problems, but it might have made a difference.\n\nI don't get why priests can't have families or lead a normal life outside of their devotion to God. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but so are many other people who have jobs and families. It's not like they're asking for a complete separation from the world; they just want to balance their work and personal life.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, being gay isn't something people choose consciously, so it's not fair to hold them accountable for it. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice they make, and I don't think it's right to punish someone for how they're born. I haven't really thought deeply about this topic, but it seems pretty clear to me that it's wrong to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's not like being gay is something people choose; they're just born that way. I mean, just like I was born straight, and that's not something I consciously chose. It's not fair to hold them responsible for something that's not in their control. I think it's wrong to put people on a pedestal, judging them for being gay.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral values. They're overstepping their boundaries and imposing their opinions on people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nIt's pretty simple: if being gay isn't a choice, then why should the government have the right to intervene? It's not their place to dictate how people live their lives or who they love. I just don't think it's right to punish people for being themselves.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The thing is, there's really no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's a completely different situation, and there are so many nuances to it that make it hard to compare the two. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing - they're not.\n\nWhen it comes to civil rights, gay couples are often left out. For example, when you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be by your side in the hospital or visit you because they're not considered family. That just doesn't seem fair, especially when you're committed to spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. Where people get hung up is when they think that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church. But what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships. People worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are just excuses. What about children of gay couples? Can they really be any different from children of straight couples? In many places, like New York City, kids of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in public schools.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now. President Bush has strong views on gay marriage, but they're based on his personal beliefs, not fact. And let's be honest, morality is subjective and differs from person to person. To impose one group's morality on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they think being gay is a choice or a personality defect, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth, and it's time we listened to the experts, not our neighbors or popular opinion.",
            "So, I wanted to share something with you about my job at the hospital pharmacy over the summer. Just because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it has no therapeutic benefits. In fact, if we're talking about making it available to the public, I firmly believe the answer is no - absolutely not. However, if we're discussing its potential use for medicinal purposes, then yes, I think it's definitely worth considering. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of illicit substances that we use in pharmacies all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. These are controlled substances, but we use them because they have benefits and if we dismiss those benefits just because there's a stigma around marijuana, then I don't think that makes sense. \n\nI also don't think marijuana is comparable to alcohol, at least in terms of its potential for abuse. If you misuse alcohol, it can lead to serious issues, but the same thing can happen with marijuana. However, I do think it's worth integrating it into society gradually, rather than suddenly legalizing it. This way, people might learn to use it responsibly. \n\nOne of the main reasons people have a negative perception of marijuana is that it's illegal. But let's be real, it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could break down that image and show that marijuana is not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be, then people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday, get all dressed up, and see my friends from private school. However, now they've introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress way more casually. You'd see people coming in their beach clothes straight from the beach, even during the morning masses where everyone used to dress up. It's become a lot more relaxed. \n\nOne thing that really stands out to me is the change in dress code. People used to dress up, now they wear jeans or khakis. It's not a bad thing, it's just more casual. As for the church's inner workings, I'm not really aware of that, but I guess that's what it is now.\n\nRegarding the recent scandals about the Catholic church and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who are married and still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not about being allowed to get married or not. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and I think that's a big part of the problem. \n\nI mean, there are other religions that allow priests to be married, like Seventh Heaven, and their priests are still reverends or ministers. If someone really wants to practice their faith and get married, then they might want to look into a different faith. I think the root of the problem is more genetic, and people are born with these tendencies. You can't change that through marriage, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, then that's a whole different story, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.\n\nI don't have much else to say about the Catholic church, but I do think it's worth noting that if they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's shameful.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. It seemed like we went to war in Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which was later proven to be false. This really got under my skin. I think the Bush administration was openly deceiving the American people, and despite the evidence, they've never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced of the evidence at the time. That raises serious questions about the administration's integrity and their disregard for the constitution. It seems they've been trying to erode it since 9/11. \n\nI believe they came into office with the intention of going to war. A former treasury secretary mentioned this in his book, suggesting that President Bush was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein, which was also motivated by his father's administration. This was an underhanded way to achieve their goals.\n\nI think it's time we moved on from this conflict, but withdrawing now would likely lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order, also raises concerns. I'm not convinced this will work in the long run because it'll raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of their government. The news reports indicate that the interim government is struggling, the parliament is ineffective, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a complex and fractious situation, and I'm not sure how to articulate my concerns in a polite way.",
            "I've been thinking more about the war in Iraq, and I have to admit, it's been a bit of a struggle for me to keep up with everything. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, right? It feels like we went into it as a way to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks, but that's just my opinion. To be honest, I'm not really well-versed on the details, but I know we're trying to establish a democracy there, which seems like a great goal, but it's a long process. And now, it's like we're staying for oil and resources too. That's just not a good enough reason to keep it going when it's causing so much distress. It's a tough spot, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.\n\nOn one hand, I feel like we should keep trying to help them build a democracy, but on the other hand, it's like we're trying to impose our own values and systems on them, which could make things worse. And with the way things are going, it's hard to see a clear end in sight. I'm worried that if we stay, we'll just be prolonging the suffering and creating more hatred towards the US. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I know it's not going to be easy.\n\nI do think that we shouldn't call it a war anymore, though. I mean, we didn't declare it as a war through Congress, so it's not really a declared war, is it? And that's how it should be done, right? It's all just a big mess, and I'm not sure what the best way forward is.\n\nIt's hard for me because I know people I care about have family members over there, and it's tough to see them having to deal with all this. But at the same time, I feel like we're kind of destroying their lives and their culture. I'm not sure what the right thing to do is, but I know it's not going to be simple.",
            "Honestly, I have my doubts about it being right for a state to make it legal. I believe it's more the church's decision, considering the constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's explicitly mentioned, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established. \n\nI think it's not just about one particular set of people trying to make it illegal, but more about picking and choosing which church's beliefs to support over others. As we can see, many Catholics and Christians are against it, but it's not a unified stance across the board. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't enforce.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend it would be contradictory to what's already been written and could essentially restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should stay out of this issue. I'm not sure why there's a push for an amendment, except that it aligns with the president's personal Catholic beliefs. This shows that he's favoring one religion over others, which I don't think is right. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There's no concrete reason for the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have a significant impact on the economy. \n\nIf anything, it might have a positive effect on society. I think I've covered all my points.",
            "Let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government was not entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. They tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not that straightforward. The government capitalized on the public's outrage after 9/11 to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I've always been against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. In many ways, the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should've learned from its past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is heartbreaking.\n\nThe US government made a serious mistake by removing Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath. They tried to implant a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they didn't consider the long-term consequences. It's not an easy process to establish a stable democracy, and it's unrealistic to expect it to happen quickly. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and challenging process.\n\nOne of the main issues is that the US got involved in a war without being prepared for the outcome. They're still in Iraq in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. The situation is a long way from being resolved, and it's clear that the US government wasn't prepared for the void of power and chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nIt's hard to justify the continued involvement in Iraq when the government's initial reasons for going to war, such as the presence of WMDs, were proven false. North Korea, which actually had WMDs, didn't face the same level of aggression. It's clear that the US government is prioritizing its own interests, particularly access to oil resources, over the well-being of the people in Iraq.\n\nIt's difficult to make a decision on what to do next, but I hope that the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. However, given the current situation, it's hard to be optimistic.",
            "Well, let me think for a moment. I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage, and I've always been that way. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and something that's increasingly being shown to be influenced by biology rather than social factors. It's unfair to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control. I'm a firm supporter of gay marriage, and I think it's inhumane to discriminate against individuals in this way.\n\nIn my opinion, governments and politics shouldn't interfere with this issue at all. It's a personal and private matter, not something that should be decided at the state or national level. I've seen it firsthand in my own community - there are openly gay couples living just like any other family, taking care of their daily responsibilities and living their lives without any issues. It's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to impose his own interpretation of marriage on the rest of us.\n\nI've done some research, and it seems that there's a growing understanding that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. So, it's not necessarily something that's chosen, but rather something people are born with.\n\nTo me, the fact that straight couples can get married in secret without any fuss, but gay couples are put under a microscope, is a huge issue. It's something that should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle. I think it's time we treat all couples equally and respect their right to love and marry whoever they choose.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's essentially a public declaration. It's out there for anyone to see, and you can't take it back. As someone who's dealt with this in my role as an R.A., it's a reality you have to face. What you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or extreme actions, someone's bound to take notice and share it. The internet is a global platform, and if you're connected to someone who receives that bulletin, they might react. Schools, for instance, can't ignore these warnings; they have to act on them to ensure everyone's safety. However, it's also challenging to discern what's serious and what's just a joke, especially when we've seen cases like the one that happened at our school, which could have been a twisted social experiment gone wrong. In this particular instance, someone overheard a comment and reported it to the school after researching the individual's online presence. They found concerning content that, in hindsight, was meant as a joke but took on a serious tone in the context. When you put something online, you lose control over who sees it and what they make of it. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't dictate how people perceive you or what they take seriously. Schools shouldn't be monitoring students' online activities, but if concerns are raised, they do have a responsibility to investigate. It's a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety. I think school officials should focus on addressing issues raised by students, rather than actively searching for information. But if concerns are brought to their attention, they should take them seriously and act accordingly.",
            "I'm getting the feeling that the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble cause. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. It now feels like we're fighting just for the sake of it, to prove our military might, rather than for the original reason. I'm also concerned that the underlying motivations might have been questionable from the start, considering the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country with no fair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if there were no personal interests involved. Unfortunately, I think our purpose has been distorted over time. I believe we made our point with the initial invasion, which was a significant statement in itself. However, the fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, maybe even years, is just too long.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a legitimate reason for war, but I don't think that's our reason anymore. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, to avoid losing face or to claim a decisive victory. I genuinely think it's time to bring this to an end.\n\nI believe it's been long enough for the local government to take responsibility for themselves. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be better spent on our own pressing issues like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. It's like we're sacrificing our own citizens for a cause that's been lost. Our economy is being drained, and I think it's time to stop this unnecessary expenditure.\n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal improvements. The money being spent on this war could be better spent on our own citizens' welfare. It's a shame that our own people are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer valid.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I had a thought and I wanted to clarify it.  It was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue.  I think it's fair to say that when you post information online, like on Myspace, you have to know that lots of people can see it.  Even though you have to accept someone as a friend before they can view your profile, you're essentially giving them permission to see it.  It's like this whenever you put anything online - you have to be aware that a lot of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tricky situation because on one hand, it's good that someone was able to catch that potential issue and prevent something bad from happening.  On the other hand, it does raise some questions about who should be monitoring these profiles and under what circumstances.  If they're just randomly looking at everyone's profiles, that's a different story than if they're actively looking for something specific.\n\nPersonally, I've had some concerns about privacy online.  I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook and I'm aware that there are people out there who might be looking at my stuff.  I've even seen a documentary or show about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and meet up with them in a short amount of time.  It's a bit unnerving, but at the same time, I don't want to limit my online presence too much because I value being able to communicate with friends.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, but I guess that's just the way it is when you're online.  I did hear about a school that banned students from having Myspace accounts, which I thought was a bit strange because I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nThat's all I really have to say on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I feel like I have to discuss the Iraq War. To be honest, I'm worried about sounding like one of those people who only speak out against it now, but I genuinely believe it was a bad idea from the start. The general consensus around the world, except within the administration, was that it was a flawed concept. It's pretty clear, given the recent polls. In the US, Iraq, and globally, a staggering 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even a significant number of US troops currently in Iraq, around 70%, believe it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. This disaster was already unfolding before our involvement, and now trying to pull out will only add to it. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, making it extremely challenging, if not impossible, for our administration to impose democracy on a region that may not want it. We have to consider the potential consequences of invading a country, even if its leader was a ruthless dictator like Saddam. I think it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before making such a drastic decision. Withdrawing from Iraq is the most sensible option, considering the situation has only deteriorated since our involvement. I haven't heard any compelling arguments for staying, and I'm not convinced by the administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal. If they want to leave in stages over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I just can't see a valid reason for prolonging our presence. It's ironic that around 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter believe we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help, it's worth considering their opinions, especially since they're the ones who'll be living with the consequences. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least we can't be blamed if things go wrong. If we decide to help after leaving, we might at least be seen as the less-bad guys in the Middle East, which isn't saying much, but it's better than our current situation.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about this, and I believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though - it affects the specific field of work you're in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because of the glass ceiling, even though we're supposed to have equality. It's hard to find people who are willing to work under a woman, especially when society has been conditioned to think otherwise for so long. Women often see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in upper management. This isn't just a women's issue, though - the same thing happens to men in different industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\n\nIt's not common for men to stay at home and take care of the kids, and when they do, people often look down on them because they think men should be the breadwinners. This can be really tough on them, especially if they've always dreamed of being with their kids and helping raise them. In the fashion industry, males are often judged based on their style and background, and if they don't fit the typical mold, people might question their expertise. It's not just about being a man or a woman, though - it's about being taken seriously in your field.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and it's hard to change fast. But I think we're making progress, slowly. Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business, and men are staying at home to care for their kids. People are starting to realize that women might have the better job or that men can be stay-at-home dads. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist, but if you show them the good qualities, they might start to accept it. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become enforced, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though - people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against too. For example, someone from a rural area might not have the best grammar, but they're incredibly intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their accent or lack of grammatical skills. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you're perceived. I think that's another example of how discrimination can work.",
            "I think I've got a better understanding of the situation now - it's been decriminalized, not fully legalized. That means it's more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of being arrested and taken in. However, people still worry about the long-term consequences, like job interviews and things like that, even after it's been decriminalized. On the other hand, arresting people for marijuana possession is expensive - it costs a lot to bring them in, book them, and let them go, not to mention the court costs and public defenders. Some places just can't afford that, so they're not willing to make the change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things like public education and social programs. \n\nIn a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's a good idea. It's freed up a lot of money that can be spent on things that really matter. But, it's not all good - there are still reasons why marijuana shouldn't be widely available, like the fact that it could be a problem if people start smoking and driving. Plus, it's still not widely accepted in a lot of places, so it would be awkward to have it out in the open like that.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles than their motor skills, and that's not something you can generalize easily. People react to substances differently, and some people are naturally more responsible than others. But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects. It's just hard to make a blanket statement about it when people are so different.",
            "I'd say yes to the idea because it has a lot of traditional elements that have been around for a long time. It's great to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. One thing that comes to mind is the Catholic Church's weekly attendance requirement and their strict adherence to tradition. At times, I feel like the Church looks down on people who don't perfectly follow their doctrine, and they often don't accept those who aren't practicing Catholics exactly as they should be. This is evident in my own family's experience - my parents, who were from different religious backgrounds, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. The Catholic teaching of loving others is a great message, but it's not always put into action. I believe the Church sticks to outdated practices, even when they contradict their own teachings. This inconsistency is a significant issue.\n\nAs for the idea of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not convinced it would make a significant difference in the way priests behave. People who are prone to child molestation would likely continue their behavior regardless of their marital status. It's not the same as being married to a consenting adult, and I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a deterrent.\n\nUltimately, I think the real issue is the power dynamic and the lack of accountability, not the fact that priests are celibate. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily change the underlying problems that lead to these horrific acts.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this, but I haven't quite made up my mind yet. To be honest, I'm not sure who's right or wrong on this issue. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're dealing with right now. It's a delicate balance between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a complicated matter that can easily offend someone.\n\nHonestly, I'm having a hard time figuring out whether marriage should be viewed as all civil unions or something more. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining it, considering it's often seen as a sacrament. If it were viewed as a civil union, people would still get tax breaks and the government wouldn't need to consider the specifics of the marriage. In my opinion, that's what it boils down to - two people committing to each other, without the government interfering with church and state.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is involved makes it even more complicated. Essentially, it comes down to two people getting a civil union. If all states could come to a logical agreement, I think they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. The constitution shouldn't be amended for a cause that's not significant enough. It's not a massive issue, and it shouldn't require such a drastic measure to define or ban it.\n\nIt's really not that important to amend the constitution just to deal with gay marriage. Put simply, it's just not worth it.",
            "To be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and for me, homosexuality is a complex issue. I have many gay friends, which has given me a different perspective on the matter. While I may not fully agree with a gay lifestyle, I strongly believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's something the federal government should dictate, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nIt seems like many states have different political leanings, with some being more democratic and others more republican. In a democratic state, it's likely that gay marriage will be supported, and if you choose to live there, you're basically agreeing to abide by their laws. Therefore, I don't think you should disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI do think that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I believe each state should be able to decide whether to legalize gay marriage. This way, it's up to the individual states to make their own decisions, rather than having a single president impose his views on the entire country.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but I'll repeat myself: I don't think President Bush should have the power to dictate whether the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it's up to each individual state to decide how to govern itself. Since the president won't be in office forever, and his successor might have a different stance on the issue, it's best to leave it up to the states. That way, they'll have to live with the consequences of their decision, not the president.\n\nAs for whether a president should be able to impose their will on all states, I don't think so. They can't live in every state, so how could they possibly know what's best for each one? It's better to let the states decide their own fate.\n\nTo answer your question directly, I don't think it's right for the president to have that kind of power. It's just a matter of letting each state govern itself, and the president can focus on more pressing issues.",
            "I'm not sure what you're getting at, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform where you post things for anyone to see, whether it's school officials or not. If you post something online, you have to accept that people will see it, regardless of whether they're from the school or not. In my opinion, if the school officials saw the post, they had every right to because even if it wasn't under the school's name, they could have accessed it from their homes.\n\nAs long as it helps prevent something like a school shooting, which is a school's responsibility, I think it's perfectly fine. If they're going on Myspace to check if students are doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, they're essentially fishing for trouble. But if it leads to making the school a safer place, I don't consider that an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's similar to if they were to go on the internet to prevent students from doing things that put others in danger. If you post something on Myspace, not expecting to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. We all have to be careful about what we post online because it's there forever and can come back to haunt us. Even something you consider harmless can be used against you.\n\nIf a school official catches you doing something bad when you're a student, it's not an invasion of privacy when they take action. It's the same with the internet - once you post something, there's no taking it back. So if you're concerned about a school official seeing your post, maybe you shouldn't post it in the first place.\n\nIf the school officials are using the internet to make the school a safer place, I think that's okay. It's similar to what we did in my high school, where we had lockdown drills and practices to prepare for emergencies. The school officials were just doing the same thing - taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThat's basically my point - it's a public platform, and if you post something online, you have to accept the consequences.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking more about this, and I have to admit that my initial feelings about the war have changed. To be honest, I was really passionate about it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to make a difference and show them what we'd been through. But looking back, I think we jumped into it without a clear plan and without thinking about the long-term consequences. We were so caught up in the emotions and anger that we overlooked some major things.\n\nI genuinely believe that we've been there for too long without making significant progress. The more I see, the more I think that the people over there are their own worst enemies. As long as they're busy fighting with each other, they're not going to be a threat to us. The war has just become a never-ending cycle, and I'm not convinced it's doing much good.\n\nMy feelings have definitely shifted, and I'm now more against the war than I was for it. I don't think we're the right people to try to change them; they've been that way for too long. I'm not saying we should have just left them to their problems, but a more thoughtful approach might have been better. We were so caught up in the desire for revenge that we didn't think things through.\n\nTo be honest, I think President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was also a bit impulsive. I understand where he was coming from at the time, but I think we should have been more careful about how we approached it. We rushed in without a clear plan, and that's led to a lot of confusion and problems.\n\nI still think we did what we had to do, but I wish we'd done it more thoughtfully. We're not going to be able to change them; they're too entrenched in their ways. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going on with this. We're not making enough progress, and when we leave, things will probably just fall apart. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider coming home."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some significant changes. They're losing followers, and it's largely because they're not very accepting of many things. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control is really outdated. While I understand that they have strong views on these topics, I believe that if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to reject the Church's views on these issues, and it's causing a lot of people to turn against them.\n\nIf you're someone who supports abortion or gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a community where these things are viewed as completely wrong. It's the same with other issues – if the Church doesn't agree with your values, you might not want to be part of their community. It's hard to see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think it would have prevented the problems, but it might have made a difference.\n\nI don't get why priests can't have families or lead a normal life outside of their devotion to God. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but so are many other people who have jobs and families. It's not like they're asking for a complete separation from the world; they just want to balance their work and personal life.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, being gay isn't something people choose consciously, so it's not fair to hold them accountable for it. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice they make, and I don't think it's right to punish someone for how they're born. I haven't really thought deeply about this topic, but it seems pretty clear to me that it's wrong to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's not like being gay is something people choose; they're just born that way. I mean, just like I was born straight, and that's not something I consciously chose. It's not fair to hold them responsible for something that's not in their control. I think it's wrong to put people on a pedestal, judging them for being gay.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral values. They're overstepping their boundaries and imposing their opinions on people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nIt's pretty simple: if being gay isn't a choice, then why should the government have the right to intervene? It's not their place to dictate how people live their lives or who they love. I just don't think it's right to punish people for being themselves.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The thing is, there's really no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's a completely different situation, and there are so many nuances to it that make it hard to compare the two. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing - they're not.\n\nWhen it comes to civil rights, gay couples are often left out. For example, when you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be by your side in the hospital or visit you because they're not considered family. That just doesn't seem fair, especially when you're committed to spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. Where people get hung up is when they think that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church. But what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships. People worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are just excuses. What about children of gay couples? Can they really be any different from children of straight couples? In many places, like New York City, kids of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in public schools.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now. President Bush has strong views on gay marriage, but they're based on his personal beliefs, not fact. And let's be honest, morality is subjective and differs from person to person. To impose one group's morality on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they think being gay is a choice or a personality defect, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth, and it's time we listened to the experts, not our neighbors or popular opinion.",
            "So, I wanted to share something with you about my job at the hospital pharmacy over the summer. Just because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it has no therapeutic benefits. In fact, if we're talking about making it available to the public, I firmly believe the answer is no - absolutely not. However, if we're discussing its potential use for medicinal purposes, then yes, I think it's definitely worth considering. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of illicit substances that we use in pharmacies all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. These are controlled substances, but we use them because they have benefits and if we dismiss those benefits just because there's a stigma around marijuana, then I don't think that makes sense. \n\nI also don't think marijuana is comparable to alcohol, at least in terms of its potential for abuse. If you misuse alcohol, it can lead to serious issues, but the same thing can happen with marijuana. However, I do think it's worth integrating it into society gradually, rather than suddenly legalizing it. This way, people might learn to use it responsibly. \n\nOne of the main reasons people have a negative perception of marijuana is that it's illegal. But let's be real, it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could break down that image and show that marijuana is not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be, then people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday, get all dressed up, and see my friends from private school. However, now they've introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress way more casually. You'd see people coming in their beach clothes straight from the beach, even during the morning masses where everyone used to dress up. It's become a lot more relaxed. \n\nOne thing that really stands out to me is the change in dress code. People used to dress up, now they wear jeans or khakis. It's not a bad thing, it's just more casual. As for the church's inner workings, I'm not really aware of that, but I guess that's what it is now.\n\nRegarding the recent scandals about the Catholic church and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who are married and still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not about being allowed to get married or not. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and I think that's a big part of the problem. \n\nI mean, there are other religions that allow priests to be married, like Seventh Heaven, and their priests are still reverends or ministers. If someone really wants to practice their faith and get married, then they might want to look into a different faith. I think the root of the problem is more genetic, and people are born with these tendencies. You can't change that through marriage, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, then that's a whole different story, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.\n\nI don't have much else to say about the Catholic church, but I do think it's worth noting that if they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's shameful.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. It seemed like we went to war in Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which was later proven to be false. This really got under my skin. I think the Bush administration was openly deceiving the American people, and despite the evidence, they've never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced of the evidence at the time. That raises serious questions about the administration's integrity and their disregard for the constitution. It seems they've been trying to erode it since 9/11. \n\nI believe they came into office with the intention of going to war. A former treasury secretary mentioned this in his book, suggesting that President Bush was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein, which was also motivated by his father's administration. This was an underhanded way to achieve their goals.\n\nI think it's time we moved on from this conflict, but withdrawing now would likely lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order, also raises concerns. I'm not convinced this will work in the long run because it'll raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of their government. The news reports indicate that the interim government is struggling, the parliament is ineffective, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a complex and fractious situation, and I'm not sure how to articulate my concerns in a polite way.",
            "I've been thinking more about the war in Iraq, and I have to admit, it's been a bit of a struggle for me to keep up with everything. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, right? It feels like we went into it as a way to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks, but that's just my opinion. To be honest, I'm not really well-versed on the details, but I know we're trying to establish a democracy there, which seems like a great goal, but it's a long process. And now, it's like we're staying for oil and resources too. That's just not a good enough reason to keep it going when it's causing so much distress. It's a tough spot, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.\n\nOn one hand, I feel like we should keep trying to help them build a democracy, but on the other hand, it's like we're trying to impose our own values and systems on them, which could make things worse. And with the way things are going, it's hard to see a clear end in sight. I'm worried that if we stay, we'll just be prolonging the suffering and creating more hatred towards the US. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I know it's not going to be easy.\n\nI do think that we shouldn't call it a war anymore, though. I mean, we didn't declare it as a war through Congress, so it's not really a declared war, is it? And that's how it should be done, right? It's all just a big mess, and I'm not sure what the best way forward is.\n\nIt's hard for me because I know people I care about have family members over there, and it's tough to see them having to deal with all this. But at the same time, I feel like we're kind of destroying their lives and their culture. I'm not sure what the right thing to do is, but I know it's not going to be simple.",
            "Honestly, I have my doubts about it being right for a state to make it legal. I believe it's more the church's decision, considering the constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's explicitly mentioned, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established. \n\nI think it's not just about one particular set of people trying to make it illegal, but more about picking and choosing which church's beliefs to support over others. As we can see, many Catholics and Christians are against it, but it's not a unified stance across the board. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't enforce.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend it would be contradictory to what's already been written and could essentially restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should stay out of this issue. I'm not sure why there's a push for an amendment, except that it aligns with the president's personal Catholic beliefs. This shows that he's favoring one religion over others, which I don't think is right. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There's no concrete reason for the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have a significant impact on the economy. \n\nIf anything, it might have a positive effect on society. I think I've covered all my points.",
            "Let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government was not entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. They tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not that straightforward. The government capitalized on the public's outrage after 9/11 to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I've always been against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. In many ways, the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should've learned from its past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is heartbreaking.\n\nThe US government made a serious mistake by removing Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath. They tried to implant a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they didn't consider the long-term consequences. It's not an easy process to establish a stable democracy, and it's unrealistic to expect it to happen quickly. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and challenging process.\n\nOne of the main issues is that the US got involved in a war without being prepared for the outcome. They're still in Iraq in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. The situation is a long way from being resolved, and it's clear that the US government wasn't prepared for the void of power and chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nIt's hard to justify the continued involvement in Iraq when the government's initial reasons for going to war, such as the presence of WMDs, were proven false. North Korea, which actually had WMDs, didn't face the same level of aggression. It's clear that the US government is prioritizing its own interests, particularly access to oil resources, over the well-being of the people in Iraq.\n\nIt's difficult to make a decision on what to do next, but I hope that the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. However, given the current situation, it's hard to be optimistic.",
            "Well, let me think for a moment. I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage, and I've always been that way. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and something that's increasingly being shown to be influenced by biology rather than social factors. It's unfair to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control. I'm a firm supporter of gay marriage, and I think it's inhumane to discriminate against individuals in this way.\n\nIn my opinion, governments and politics shouldn't interfere with this issue at all. It's a personal and private matter, not something that should be decided at the state or national level. I've seen it firsthand in my own community - there are openly gay couples living just like any other family, taking care of their daily responsibilities and living their lives without any issues. It's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to impose his own interpretation of marriage on the rest of us.\n\nI've done some research, and it seems that there's a growing understanding that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. So, it's not necessarily something that's chosen, but rather something people are born with.\n\nTo me, the fact that straight couples can get married in secret without any fuss, but gay couples are put under a microscope, is a huge issue. It's something that should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle. I think it's time we treat all couples equally and respect their right to love and marry whoever they choose.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's essentially a public declaration. It's out there for anyone to see, and you can't take it back. As someone who's dealt with this in my role as an R.A., it's a reality you have to face. What you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or extreme actions, someone's bound to take notice and share it. The internet is a global platform, and if you're connected to someone who receives that bulletin, they might react. Schools, for instance, can't ignore these warnings; they have to act on them to ensure everyone's safety. However, it's also challenging to discern what's serious and what's just a joke, especially when we've seen cases like the one that happened at our school, which could have been a twisted social experiment gone wrong. In this particular instance, someone overheard a comment and reported it to the school after researching the individual's online presence. They found concerning content that, in hindsight, was meant as a joke but took on a serious tone in the context. When you put something online, you lose control over who sees it and what they make of it. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't dictate how people perceive you or what they take seriously. Schools shouldn't be monitoring students' online activities, but if concerns are raised, they do have a responsibility to investigate. It's a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety. I think school officials should focus on addressing issues raised by students, rather than actively searching for information. But if concerns are brought to their attention, they should take them seriously and act accordingly.",
            "I'm getting the feeling that the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble cause. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. It now feels like we're fighting just for the sake of it, to prove our military might, rather than for the original reason. I'm also concerned that the underlying motivations might have been questionable from the start, considering the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country with no fair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if there were no personal interests involved. Unfortunately, I think our purpose has been distorted over time. I believe we made our point with the initial invasion, which was a significant statement in itself. However, the fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, maybe even years, is just too long.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a legitimate reason for war, but I don't think that's our reason anymore. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, to avoid losing face or to claim a decisive victory. I genuinely think it's time to bring this to an end.\n\nI believe it's been long enough for the local government to take responsibility for themselves. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be better spent on our own pressing issues like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. It's like we're sacrificing our own citizens for a cause that's been lost. Our economy is being drained, and I think it's time to stop this unnecessary expenditure.\n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal improvements. The money being spent on this war could be better spent on our own citizens' welfare. It's a shame that our own people are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer valid.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I had a thought and I wanted to clarify it.  It was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue.  I think it's fair to say that when you post information online, like on Myspace, you have to know that lots of people can see it.  Even though you have to accept someone as a friend before they can view your profile, you're essentially giving them permission to see it.  It's like this whenever you put anything online - you have to be aware that a lot of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tricky situation because on one hand, it's good that someone was able to catch that potential issue and prevent something bad from happening.  On the other hand, it does raise some questions about who should be monitoring these profiles and under what circumstances.  If they're just randomly looking at everyone's profiles, that's a different story than if they're actively looking for something specific.\n\nPersonally, I've had some concerns about privacy online.  I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook and I'm aware that there are people out there who might be looking at my stuff.  I've even seen a documentary or show about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and meet up with them in a short amount of time.  It's a bit unnerving, but at the same time, I don't want to limit my online presence too much because I value being able to communicate with friends.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, but I guess that's just the way it is when you're online.  I did hear about a school that banned students from having Myspace accounts, which I thought was a bit strange because I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nThat's all I really have to say on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I feel like I have to discuss the Iraq War. To be honest, I'm worried about sounding like one of those people who only speak out against it now, but I genuinely believe it was a bad idea from the start. The general consensus around the world, except within the administration, was that it was a flawed concept. It's pretty clear, given the recent polls. In the US, Iraq, and globally, a staggering 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even a significant number of US troops currently in Iraq, around 70%, believe it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. This disaster was already unfolding before our involvement, and now trying to pull out will only add to it. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, making it extremely challenging, if not impossible, for our administration to impose democracy on a region that may not want it. We have to consider the potential consequences of invading a country, even if its leader was a ruthless dictator like Saddam. I think it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before making such a drastic decision. Withdrawing from Iraq is the most sensible option, considering the situation has only deteriorated since our involvement. I haven't heard any compelling arguments for staying, and I'm not convinced by the administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal. If they want to leave in stages over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I just can't see a valid reason for prolonging our presence. It's ironic that around 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter believe we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help, it's worth considering their opinions, especially since they're the ones who'll be living with the consequences. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least we can't be blamed if things go wrong. If we decide to help after leaving, we might at least be seen as the less-bad guys in the Middle East, which isn't saying much, but it's better than our current situation.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about this, and I believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though - it affects the specific field of work you're in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because of the glass ceiling, even though we're supposed to have equality. It's hard to find people who are willing to work under a woman, especially when society has been conditioned to think otherwise for so long. Women often see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in upper management. This isn't just a women's issue, though - the same thing happens to men in different industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\n\nIt's not common for men to stay at home and take care of the kids, and when they do, people often look down on them because they think men should be the breadwinners. This can be really tough on them, especially if they've always dreamed of being with their kids and helping raise them. In the fashion industry, males are often judged based on their style and background, and if they don't fit the typical mold, people might question their expertise. It's not just about being a man or a woman, though - it's about being taken seriously in your field.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and it's hard to change fast. But I think we're making progress, slowly. Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business, and men are staying at home to care for their kids. People are starting to realize that women might have the better job or that men can be stay-at-home dads. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist, but if you show them the good qualities, they might start to accept it. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become enforced, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though - people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against too. For example, someone from a rural area might not have the best grammar, but they're incredibly intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their accent or lack of grammatical skills. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you're perceived. I think that's another example of how discrimination can work.",
            "I think I've got a better understanding of the situation now - it's been decriminalized, not fully legalized. That means it's more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of being arrested and taken in. However, people still worry about the long-term consequences, like job interviews and things like that, even after it's been decriminalized. On the other hand, arresting people for marijuana possession is expensive - it costs a lot to bring them in, book them, and let them go, not to mention the court costs and public defenders. Some places just can't afford that, so they're not willing to make the change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things like public education and social programs. \n\nIn a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's a good idea. It's freed up a lot of money that can be spent on things that really matter. But, it's not all good - there are still reasons why marijuana shouldn't be widely available, like the fact that it could be a problem if people start smoking and driving. Plus, it's still not widely accepted in a lot of places, so it would be awkward to have it out in the open like that.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles than their motor skills, and that's not something you can generalize easily. People react to substances differently, and some people are naturally more responsible than others. But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects. It's just hard to make a blanket statement about it when people are so different.",
            "I'd say yes to the idea because it has a lot of traditional elements that have been around for a long time. It's great to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. One thing that comes to mind is the Catholic Church's weekly attendance requirement and their strict adherence to tradition. At times, I feel like the Church looks down on people who don't perfectly follow their doctrine, and they often don't accept those who aren't practicing Catholics exactly as they should be. This is evident in my own family's experience - my parents, who were from different religious backgrounds, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. The Catholic teaching of loving others is a great message, but it's not always put into action. I believe the Church sticks to outdated practices, even when they contradict their own teachings. This inconsistency is a significant issue.\n\nAs for the idea of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not convinced it would make a significant difference in the way priests behave. People who are prone to child molestation would likely continue their behavior regardless of their marital status. It's not the same as being married to a consenting adult, and I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a deterrent.\n\nUltimately, I think the real issue is the power dynamic and the lack of accountability, not the fact that priests are celibate. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily change the underlying problems that lead to these horrific acts.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this, but I haven't quite made up my mind yet. To be honest, I'm not sure who's right or wrong on this issue. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're dealing with right now. It's a delicate balance between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a complicated matter that can easily offend someone.\n\nHonestly, I'm having a hard time figuring out whether marriage should be viewed as all civil unions or something more. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining it, considering it's often seen as a sacrament. If it were viewed as a civil union, people would still get tax breaks and the government wouldn't need to consider the specifics of the marriage. In my opinion, that's what it boils down to - two people committing to each other, without the government interfering with church and state.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is involved makes it even more complicated. Essentially, it comes down to two people getting a civil union. If all states could come to a logical agreement, I think they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. The constitution shouldn't be amended for a cause that's not significant enough. It's not a massive issue, and it shouldn't require such a drastic measure to define or ban it.\n\nIt's really not that important to amend the constitution just to deal with gay marriage. Put simply, it's just not worth it.",
            "To be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and for me, homosexuality is a complex issue. I have many gay friends, which has given me a different perspective on the matter. While I may not fully agree with a gay lifestyle, I strongly believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's something the federal government should dictate, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nIt seems like many states have different political leanings, with some being more democratic and others more republican. In a democratic state, it's likely that gay marriage will be supported, and if you choose to live there, you're basically agreeing to abide by their laws. Therefore, I don't think you should disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI do think that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I believe each state should be able to decide whether to legalize gay marriage. This way, it's up to the individual states to make their own decisions, rather than having a single president impose his views on the entire country.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but I'll repeat myself: I don't think President Bush should have the power to dictate whether the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it's up to each individual state to decide how to govern itself. Since the president won't be in office forever, and his successor might have a different stance on the issue, it's best to leave it up to the states. That way, they'll have to live with the consequences of their decision, not the president.\n\nAs for whether a president should be able to impose their will on all states, I don't think so. They can't live in every state, so how could they possibly know what's best for each one? It's better to let the states decide their own fate.\n\nTo answer your question directly, I don't think it's right for the president to have that kind of power. It's just a matter of letting each state govern itself, and the president can focus on more pressing issues.",
            "I'm not sure what you're getting at, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform where you post things for anyone to see, whether it's school officials or not. If you post something online, you have to accept that people will see it, regardless of whether they're from the school or not. In my opinion, if the school officials saw the post, they had every right to because even if it wasn't under the school's name, they could have accessed it from their homes.\n\nAs long as it helps prevent something like a school shooting, which is a school's responsibility, I think it's perfectly fine. If they're going on Myspace to check if students are doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, they're essentially fishing for trouble. But if it leads to making the school a safer place, I don't consider that an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's similar to if they were to go on the internet to prevent students from doing things that put others in danger. If you post something on Myspace, not expecting to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. We all have to be careful about what we post online because it's there forever and can come back to haunt us. Even something you consider harmless can be used against you.\n\nIf a school official catches you doing something bad when you're a student, it's not an invasion of privacy when they take action. It's the same with the internet - once you post something, there's no taking it back. So if you're concerned about a school official seeing your post, maybe you shouldn't post it in the first place.\n\nIf the school officials are using the internet to make the school a safer place, I think that's okay. It's similar to what we did in my high school, where we had lockdown drills and practices to prepare for emergencies. The school officials were just doing the same thing - taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThat's basically my point - it's a public platform, and if you post something online, you have to accept the consequences.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking more about this, and I have to admit that my initial feelings about the war have changed. To be honest, I was really passionate about it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to make a difference and show them what we'd been through. But looking back, I think we jumped into it without a clear plan and without thinking about the long-term consequences. We were so caught up in the emotions and anger that we overlooked some major things.\n\nI genuinely believe that we've been there for too long without making significant progress. The more I see, the more I think that the people over there are their own worst enemies. As long as they're busy fighting with each other, they're not going to be a threat to us. The war has just become a never-ending cycle, and I'm not convinced it's doing much good.\n\nMy feelings have definitely shifted, and I'm now more against the war than I was for it. I don't think we're the right people to try to change them; they've been that way for too long. I'm not saying we should have just left them to their problems, but a more thoughtful approach might have been better. We were so caught up in the desire for revenge that we didn't think things through.\n\nTo be honest, I think President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was also a bit impulsive. I understand where he was coming from at the time, but I think we should have been more careful about how we approached it. We rushed in without a clear plan, and that's led to a lot of confusion and problems.\n\nI still think we did what we had to do, but I wish we'd done it more thoughtfully. We're not going to be able to change them; they're too entrenched in their ways. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going on with this. We're not making enough progress, and when we leave, things will probably just fall apart. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider coming home."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some significant changes. They're losing followers, and it's largely because they're not very accepting of many things. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control is really outdated. While I understand that they have strong views on these topics, I believe that if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to reject the Church's views on these issues, and it's causing a lot of people to turn against them.\n\nIf you're someone who supports abortion or gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a community where these things are viewed as completely wrong. It's the same with other issues – if the Church doesn't agree with your values, you might not want to be part of their community. It's hard to see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think it would have prevented the problems, but it might have made a difference.\n\nI don't get why priests can't have families or lead a normal life outside of their devotion to God. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but so are many other people who have jobs and families. It's not like they're asking for a complete separation from the world; they just want to balance their work and personal life.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, being gay isn't something people choose consciously, so it's not fair to hold them accountable for it. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice they make, and I don't think it's right to punish someone for how they're born. I haven't really thought deeply about this topic, but it seems pretty clear to me that it's wrong to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's not like being gay is something people choose; they're just born that way. I mean, just like I was born straight, and that's not something I consciously chose. It's not fair to hold them responsible for something that's not in their control. I think it's wrong to put people on a pedestal, judging them for being gay.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral values. They're overstepping their boundaries and imposing their opinions on people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nIt's pretty simple: if being gay isn't a choice, then why should the government have the right to intervene? It's not their place to dictate how people live their lives or who they love. I just don't think it's right to punish people for being themselves.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The thing is, there's really no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's a completely different situation, and there are so many nuances to it that make it hard to compare the two. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing - they're not.\n\nWhen it comes to civil rights, gay couples are often left out. For example, when you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be by your side in the hospital or visit you because they're not considered family. That just doesn't seem fair, especially when you're committed to spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. Where people get hung up is when they think that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church. But what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships. People worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are just excuses. What about children of gay couples? Can they really be any different from children of straight couples? In many places, like New York City, kids of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in public schools.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now. President Bush has strong views on gay marriage, but they're based on his personal beliefs, not fact. And let's be honest, morality is subjective and differs from person to person. To impose one group's morality on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they think being gay is a choice or a personality defect, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth, and it's time we listened to the experts, not our neighbors or popular opinion.",
            "So, I wanted to share something with you about my job at the hospital pharmacy over the summer. Just because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it has no therapeutic benefits. In fact, if we're talking about making it available to the public, I firmly believe the answer is no - absolutely not. However, if we're discussing its potential use for medicinal purposes, then yes, I think it's definitely worth considering. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of illicit substances that we use in pharmacies all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. These are controlled substances, but we use them because they have benefits and if we dismiss those benefits just because there's a stigma around marijuana, then I don't think that makes sense. \n\nI also don't think marijuana is comparable to alcohol, at least in terms of its potential for abuse. If you misuse alcohol, it can lead to serious issues, but the same thing can happen with marijuana. However, I do think it's worth integrating it into society gradually, rather than suddenly legalizing it. This way, people might learn to use it responsibly. \n\nOne of the main reasons people have a negative perception of marijuana is that it's illegal. But let's be real, it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could break down that image and show that marijuana is not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be, then people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday, get all dressed up, and see my friends from private school. However, now they've introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress way more casually. You'd see people coming in their beach clothes straight from the beach, even during the morning masses where everyone used to dress up. It's become a lot more relaxed. \n\nOne thing that really stands out to me is the change in dress code. People used to dress up, now they wear jeans or khakis. It's not a bad thing, it's just more casual. As for the church's inner workings, I'm not really aware of that, but I guess that's what it is now.\n\nRegarding the recent scandals about the Catholic church and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who are married and still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not about being allowed to get married or not. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and I think that's a big part of the problem. \n\nI mean, there are other religions that allow priests to be married, like Seventh Heaven, and their priests are still reverends or ministers. If someone really wants to practice their faith and get married, then they might want to look into a different faith. I think the root of the problem is more genetic, and people are born with these tendencies. You can't change that through marriage, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, then that's a whole different story, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.\n\nI don't have much else to say about the Catholic church, but I do think it's worth noting that if they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's shameful.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. It seemed like we went to war in Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which was later proven to be false. This really got under my skin. I think the Bush administration was openly deceiving the American people, and despite the evidence, they've never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced of the evidence at the time. That raises serious questions about the administration's integrity and their disregard for the constitution. It seems they've been trying to erode it since 9/11. \n\nI believe they came into office with the intention of going to war. A former treasury secretary mentioned this in his book, suggesting that President Bush was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein, which was also motivated by his father's administration. This was an underhanded way to achieve their goals.\n\nI think it's time we moved on from this conflict, but withdrawing now would likely lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order, also raises concerns. I'm not convinced this will work in the long run because it'll raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of their government. The news reports indicate that the interim government is struggling, the parliament is ineffective, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a complex and fractious situation, and I'm not sure how to articulate my concerns in a polite way.",
            "I've been thinking more about the war in Iraq, and I have to admit, it's been a bit of a struggle for me to keep up with everything. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, right? It feels like we went into it as a way to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks, but that's just my opinion. To be honest, I'm not really well-versed on the details, but I know we're trying to establish a democracy there, which seems like a great goal, but it's a long process. And now, it's like we're staying for oil and resources too. That's just not a good enough reason to keep it going when it's causing so much distress. It's a tough spot, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.\n\nOn one hand, I feel like we should keep trying to help them build a democracy, but on the other hand, it's like we're trying to impose our own values and systems on them, which could make things worse. And with the way things are going, it's hard to see a clear end in sight. I'm worried that if we stay, we'll just be prolonging the suffering and creating more hatred towards the US. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I know it's not going to be easy.\n\nI do think that we shouldn't call it a war anymore, though. I mean, we didn't declare it as a war through Congress, so it's not really a declared war, is it? And that's how it should be done, right? It's all just a big mess, and I'm not sure what the best way forward is.\n\nIt's hard for me because I know people I care about have family members over there, and it's tough to see them having to deal with all this. But at the same time, I feel like we're kind of destroying their lives and their culture. I'm not sure what the right thing to do is, but I know it's not going to be simple.",
            "Honestly, I have my doubts about it being right for a state to make it legal. I believe it's more the church's decision, considering the constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's explicitly mentioned, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established. \n\nI think it's not just about one particular set of people trying to make it illegal, but more about picking and choosing which church's beliefs to support over others. As we can see, many Catholics and Christians are against it, but it's not a unified stance across the board. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't enforce.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend it would be contradictory to what's already been written and could essentially restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should stay out of this issue. I'm not sure why there's a push for an amendment, except that it aligns with the president's personal Catholic beliefs. This shows that he's favoring one religion over others, which I don't think is right. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There's no concrete reason for the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have a significant impact on the economy. \n\nIf anything, it might have a positive effect on society. I think I've covered all my points.",
            "Let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government was not entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. They tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not that straightforward. The government capitalized on the public's outrage after 9/11 to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I've always been against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. In many ways, the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should've learned from its past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is heartbreaking.\n\nThe US government made a serious mistake by removing Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath. They tried to implant a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they didn't consider the long-term consequences. It's not an easy process to establish a stable democracy, and it's unrealistic to expect it to happen quickly. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and challenging process.\n\nOne of the main issues is that the US got involved in a war without being prepared for the outcome. They're still in Iraq in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. The situation is a long way from being resolved, and it's clear that the US government wasn't prepared for the void of power and chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nIt's hard to justify the continued involvement in Iraq when the government's initial reasons for going to war, such as the presence of WMDs, were proven false. North Korea, which actually had WMDs, didn't face the same level of aggression. It's clear that the US government is prioritizing its own interests, particularly access to oil resources, over the well-being of the people in Iraq.\n\nIt's difficult to make a decision on what to do next, but I hope that the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. However, given the current situation, it's hard to be optimistic.",
            "Well, let me think for a moment. I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage, and I've always been that way. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and something that's increasingly being shown to be influenced by biology rather than social factors. It's unfair to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control. I'm a firm supporter of gay marriage, and I think it's inhumane to discriminate against individuals in this way.\n\nIn my opinion, governments and politics shouldn't interfere with this issue at all. It's a personal and private matter, not something that should be decided at the state or national level. I've seen it firsthand in my own community - there are openly gay couples living just like any other family, taking care of their daily responsibilities and living their lives without any issues. It's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to impose his own interpretation of marriage on the rest of us.\n\nI've done some research, and it seems that there's a growing understanding that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. So, it's not necessarily something that's chosen, but rather something people are born with.\n\nTo me, the fact that straight couples can get married in secret without any fuss, but gay couples are put under a microscope, is a huge issue. It's something that should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle. I think it's time we treat all couples equally and respect their right to love and marry whoever they choose.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's essentially a public declaration. It's out there for anyone to see, and you can't take it back. As someone who's dealt with this in my role as an R.A., it's a reality you have to face. What you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or extreme actions, someone's bound to take notice and share it. The internet is a global platform, and if you're connected to someone who receives that bulletin, they might react. Schools, for instance, can't ignore these warnings; they have to act on them to ensure everyone's safety. However, it's also challenging to discern what's serious and what's just a joke, especially when we've seen cases like the one that happened at our school, which could have been a twisted social experiment gone wrong. In this particular instance, someone overheard a comment and reported it to the school after researching the individual's online presence. They found concerning content that, in hindsight, was meant as a joke but took on a serious tone in the context. When you put something online, you lose control over who sees it and what they make of it. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't dictate how people perceive you or what they take seriously. Schools shouldn't be monitoring students' online activities, but if concerns are raised, they do have a responsibility to investigate. It's a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety. I think school officials should focus on addressing issues raised by students, rather than actively searching for information. But if concerns are brought to their attention, they should take them seriously and act accordingly.",
            "I'm getting the feeling that the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble cause. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. It now feels like we're fighting just for the sake of it, to prove our military might, rather than for the original reason. I'm also concerned that the underlying motivations might have been questionable from the start, considering the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country with no fair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if there were no personal interests involved. Unfortunately, I think our purpose has been distorted over time. I believe we made our point with the initial invasion, which was a significant statement in itself. However, the fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, maybe even years, is just too long.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a legitimate reason for war, but I don't think that's our reason anymore. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, to avoid losing face or to claim a decisive victory. I genuinely think it's time to bring this to an end.\n\nI believe it's been long enough for the local government to take responsibility for themselves. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be better spent on our own pressing issues like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. It's like we're sacrificing our own citizens for a cause that's been lost. Our economy is being drained, and I think it's time to stop this unnecessary expenditure.\n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal improvements. The money being spent on this war could be better spent on our own citizens' welfare. It's a shame that our own people are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer valid.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I had a thought and I wanted to clarify it.  It was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue.  I think it's fair to say that when you post information online, like on Myspace, you have to know that lots of people can see it.  Even though you have to accept someone as a friend before they can view your profile, you're essentially giving them permission to see it.  It's like this whenever you put anything online - you have to be aware that a lot of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tricky situation because on one hand, it's good that someone was able to catch that potential issue and prevent something bad from happening.  On the other hand, it does raise some questions about who should be monitoring these profiles and under what circumstances.  If they're just randomly looking at everyone's profiles, that's a different story than if they're actively looking for something specific.\n\nPersonally, I've had some concerns about privacy online.  I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook and I'm aware that there are people out there who might be looking at my stuff.  I've even seen a documentary or show about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and meet up with them in a short amount of time.  It's a bit unnerving, but at the same time, I don't want to limit my online presence too much because I value being able to communicate with friends.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, but I guess that's just the way it is when you're online.  I did hear about a school that banned students from having Myspace accounts, which I thought was a bit strange because I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nThat's all I really have to say on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I feel like I have to discuss the Iraq War. To be honest, I'm worried about sounding like one of those people who only speak out against it now, but I genuinely believe it was a bad idea from the start. The general consensus around the world, except within the administration, was that it was a flawed concept. It's pretty clear, given the recent polls. In the US, Iraq, and globally, a staggering 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even a significant number of US troops currently in Iraq, around 70%, believe it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. This disaster was already unfolding before our involvement, and now trying to pull out will only add to it. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, making it extremely challenging, if not impossible, for our administration to impose democracy on a region that may not want it. We have to consider the potential consequences of invading a country, even if its leader was a ruthless dictator like Saddam. I think it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before making such a drastic decision. Withdrawing from Iraq is the most sensible option, considering the situation has only deteriorated since our involvement. I haven't heard any compelling arguments for staying, and I'm not convinced by the administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal. If they want to leave in stages over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I just can't see a valid reason for prolonging our presence. It's ironic that around 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter believe we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help, it's worth considering their opinions, especially since they're the ones who'll be living with the consequences. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least we can't be blamed if things go wrong. If we decide to help after leaving, we might at least be seen as the less-bad guys in the Middle East, which isn't saying much, but it's better than our current situation.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about this, and I believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though - it affects the specific field of work you're in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because of the glass ceiling, even though we're supposed to have equality. It's hard to find people who are willing to work under a woman, especially when society has been conditioned to think otherwise for so long. Women often see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in upper management. This isn't just a women's issue, though - the same thing happens to men in different industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\n\nIt's not common for men to stay at home and take care of the kids, and when they do, people often look down on them because they think men should be the breadwinners. This can be really tough on them, especially if they've always dreamed of being with their kids and helping raise them. In the fashion industry, males are often judged based on their style and background, and if they don't fit the typical mold, people might question their expertise. It's not just about being a man or a woman, though - it's about being taken seriously in your field.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and it's hard to change fast. But I think we're making progress, slowly. Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business, and men are staying at home to care for their kids. People are starting to realize that women might have the better job or that men can be stay-at-home dads. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist, but if you show them the good qualities, they might start to accept it. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become enforced, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though - people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against too. For example, someone from a rural area might not have the best grammar, but they're incredibly intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their accent or lack of grammatical skills. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you're perceived. I think that's another example of how discrimination can work.",
            "I think I've got a better understanding of the situation now - it's been decriminalized, not fully legalized. That means it's more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of being arrested and taken in. However, people still worry about the long-term consequences, like job interviews and things like that, even after it's been decriminalized. On the other hand, arresting people for marijuana possession is expensive - it costs a lot to bring them in, book them, and let them go, not to mention the court costs and public defenders. Some places just can't afford that, so they're not willing to make the change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things like public education and social programs. \n\nIn a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's a good idea. It's freed up a lot of money that can be spent on things that really matter. But, it's not all good - there are still reasons why marijuana shouldn't be widely available, like the fact that it could be a problem if people start smoking and driving. Plus, it's still not widely accepted in a lot of places, so it would be awkward to have it out in the open like that.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles than their motor skills, and that's not something you can generalize easily. People react to substances differently, and some people are naturally more responsible than others. But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects. It's just hard to make a blanket statement about it when people are so different.",
            "I'd say yes to the idea because it has a lot of traditional elements that have been around for a long time. It's great to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. One thing that comes to mind is the Catholic Church's weekly attendance requirement and their strict adherence to tradition. At times, I feel like the Church looks down on people who don't perfectly follow their doctrine, and they often don't accept those who aren't practicing Catholics exactly as they should be. This is evident in my own family's experience - my parents, who were from different religious backgrounds, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. The Catholic teaching of loving others is a great message, but it's not always put into action. I believe the Church sticks to outdated practices, even when they contradict their own teachings. This inconsistency is a significant issue.\n\nAs for the idea of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not convinced it would make a significant difference in the way priests behave. People who are prone to child molestation would likely continue their behavior regardless of their marital status. It's not the same as being married to a consenting adult, and I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a deterrent.\n\nUltimately, I think the real issue is the power dynamic and the lack of accountability, not the fact that priests are celibate. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily change the underlying problems that lead to these horrific acts.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this, but I haven't quite made up my mind yet. To be honest, I'm not sure who's right or wrong on this issue. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're dealing with right now. It's a delicate balance between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a complicated matter that can easily offend someone.\n\nHonestly, I'm having a hard time figuring out whether marriage should be viewed as all civil unions or something more. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining it, considering it's often seen as a sacrament. If it were viewed as a civil union, people would still get tax breaks and the government wouldn't need to consider the specifics of the marriage. In my opinion, that's what it boils down to - two people committing to each other, without the government interfering with church and state.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is involved makes it even more complicated. Essentially, it comes down to two people getting a civil union. If all states could come to a logical agreement, I think they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. The constitution shouldn't be amended for a cause that's not significant enough. It's not a massive issue, and it shouldn't require such a drastic measure to define or ban it.\n\nIt's really not that important to amend the constitution just to deal with gay marriage. Put simply, it's just not worth it.",
            "To be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and for me, homosexuality is a complex issue. I have many gay friends, which has given me a different perspective on the matter. While I may not fully agree with a gay lifestyle, I strongly believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's something the federal government should dictate, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nIt seems like many states have different political leanings, with some being more democratic and others more republican. In a democratic state, it's likely that gay marriage will be supported, and if you choose to live there, you're basically agreeing to abide by their laws. Therefore, I don't think you should disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI do think that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I believe each state should be able to decide whether to legalize gay marriage. This way, it's up to the individual states to make their own decisions, rather than having a single president impose his views on the entire country.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but I'll repeat myself: I don't think President Bush should have the power to dictate whether the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it's up to each individual state to decide how to govern itself. Since the president won't be in office forever, and his successor might have a different stance on the issue, it's best to leave it up to the states. That way, they'll have to live with the consequences of their decision, not the president.\n\nAs for whether a president should be able to impose their will on all states, I don't think so. They can't live in every state, so how could they possibly know what's best for each one? It's better to let the states decide their own fate.\n\nTo answer your question directly, I don't think it's right for the president to have that kind of power. It's just a matter of letting each state govern itself, and the president can focus on more pressing issues.",
            "I'm not sure what you're getting at, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform where you post things for anyone to see, whether it's school officials or not. If you post something online, you have to accept that people will see it, regardless of whether they're from the school or not. In my opinion, if the school officials saw the post, they had every right to because even if it wasn't under the school's name, they could have accessed it from their homes.\n\nAs long as it helps prevent something like a school shooting, which is a school's responsibility, I think it's perfectly fine. If they're going on Myspace to check if students are doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, they're essentially fishing for trouble. But if it leads to making the school a safer place, I don't consider that an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's similar to if they were to go on the internet to prevent students from doing things that put others in danger. If you post something on Myspace, not expecting to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. We all have to be careful about what we post online because it's there forever and can come back to haunt us. Even something you consider harmless can be used against you.\n\nIf a school official catches you doing something bad when you're a student, it's not an invasion of privacy when they take action. It's the same with the internet - once you post something, there's no taking it back. So if you're concerned about a school official seeing your post, maybe you shouldn't post it in the first place.\n\nIf the school officials are using the internet to make the school a safer place, I think that's okay. It's similar to what we did in my high school, where we had lockdown drills and practices to prepare for emergencies. The school officials were just doing the same thing - taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThat's basically my point - it's a public platform, and if you post something online, you have to accept the consequences.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking more about this, and I have to admit that my initial feelings about the war have changed. To be honest, I was really passionate about it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to make a difference and show them what we'd been through. But looking back, I think we jumped into it without a clear plan and without thinking about the long-term consequences. We were so caught up in the emotions and anger that we overlooked some major things.\n\nI genuinely believe that we've been there for too long without making significant progress. The more I see, the more I think that the people over there are their own worst enemies. As long as they're busy fighting with each other, they're not going to be a threat to us. The war has just become a never-ending cycle, and I'm not convinced it's doing much good.\n\nMy feelings have definitely shifted, and I'm now more against the war than I was for it. I don't think we're the right people to try to change them; they've been that way for too long. I'm not saying we should have just left them to their problems, but a more thoughtful approach might have been better. We were so caught up in the desire for revenge that we didn't think things through.\n\nTo be honest, I think President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was also a bit impulsive. I understand where he was coming from at the time, but I think we should have been more careful about how we approached it. We rushed in without a clear plan, and that's led to a lot of confusion and problems.\n\nI still think we did what we had to do, but I wish we'd done it more thoughtfully. We're not going to be able to change them; they're too entrenched in their ways. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going on with this. We're not making enough progress, and when we leave, things will probably just fall apart. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider coming home."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's due to their strict views on certain issues. I'm talking about topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While it's okay that they have strong opinions, some of these views might be seen as outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, I think they'd be less worried about losing followers.\n\nI've heard that many people, including some who were once devoted to the Catholic Church, have begun to disagree with their stance on these matters. This is because their views on issues like abortion and gay marriage might not align with the values of some individuals. As a result, people are starting to question the Church's stance and might feel that their views are outdated.\n\nTake the issue of abortion, for instance. If you're in favor of it, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community where it's strongly discouraged. The same goes for gay marriage – if you believe in it or support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's not like having a family or personal life would distract them from their devotion to God. The Church already says that priests are married to God, so why can't they have a family and dedicated relationships like everyone else in the world? It just doesn't make sense to me.",
            "Honestly, I don't have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose consciously, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. I believe it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. \n\nTo me, it seems that people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I was born straight and another person might be born gay. It's not something they can control or make a conscious decision about. It doesn't seem right to hold them responsible for something that's not their choice. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue at all. It's a personal matter that's not a security threat or a moral concern, but rather a matter of individual rights. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives or dictate who they can love. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nI'm not sure how to put it exactly, but it just seems like a matter of treating everyone with respect and equality, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think the federal government has a right to interject in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as love and relationships. \n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason not to. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. It's a completely different situation, with a multitude of factors that make it in no way comparable. It's like two sides of the same coin; you can't have heads without tails. A gay couple's relationship is built on the same fundamental aspects as a heterosexual one, with the same potential for success and satisfaction.\n\nThe issue is that same-sex couples often face unfair treatment under the law. For example, a partner may not be allowed to be with their sick loved one in the hospital or visit them because they're not considered family. This is illogical, especially considering that these couples are committed to each other for life. Studies have shown that same-sex relationships have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones, with the same factors contributing to happiness.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many couples have the same roles in their relationships, and the only difference is the sex of the partners.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, such as how a gay couple will affect their neighborhood and their children's well-being. However, these concerns are unfounded. Children of same-sex couples are no different from those of heterosexual couples; they have the same potential for success and happiness, and their parents' sexual orientation has no bearing on their upbringing.\n\nIn fact, many communities, like New York City, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and persecution in public schools. This is unacceptable. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about their love and ability to care for their children. \n\nI believe the federal government should play a significant role in making gay marriage legal across the country. The current amendment is misguided, and it's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on an entire nation, especially when it conflicts with the values of other groups. We should focus on what's fair and just, rather than what some people believe is morally right.\n\nSome people oppose gay marriage because they think gay individuals are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has stated that this is not true. We should rely on scientific research and studies, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, to understand this issue.",
            "Listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer and I wanted to share some thoughts on this. Just because a drug is considered illicit doesn't mean it's completely without benefits. I'm not saying we should make it accessible to the public, no way, not at all. However, I do think it has potential for medicinal use. It's a common misconception that just because a drug is banned, it's not beneficial. I think that's what I'm trying to get at.\n\nYeah, let me put it another way. There are plenty of controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them because they have proven benefits, even if they're not widely accepted. So, why can't the same be said for marijuana? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than the taboo surrounding it.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that comparable to alcohol. While abusing marijuana can have negative effects, so can alcohol. It's a delicate issue, but I think if we approach it carefully, we could make it work. Maybe we could regulate its use gradually, rather than making it completely legal all at once. That way, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nPeople often have a skewed view of marijuana because it's been labeled as an illicit substance. But in reality, it's not as bad as some other drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's perception of it, they might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I've been thinking about how the church has adapted to the 21st century, and it's clear that it's not as strict as it used to be. I'm not saying this as a bad thing; it's actually quite refreshing. I remember my childhood, where I'd attend church every Sunday, looking forward to seeing my friends from private school and dressing up in my favorite outfits. It was a big deal, I'd pick out a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse that complemented everything. But as I grew older, I noticed a change. They introduced a more casual, 30-minute mass, especially during the summer. People would walk in straight from the beach, and families would rush in late. Even during morning masses, where I'd always try to look polished, people started wearing jeans and khakis. It's not a bad thing; it's just a more relaxed atmosphere. The only thing I've noticed is that the church has become more laid-back. I don't know the inner workings of the church, but that's my observation.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have a problem with pedophilia, so it's not a matter of being allowed to get married or not. When someone decides to become a priest, it's a personal choice, and they're aware of their desires. Some other religions allow their clergy to be married, like Seventh-day Adventists, for example. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might consider a different faith. I think the issue is more complex than a simple solution like changing the rules.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their environment. While upbringing might play a small role, I believe it's mostly innate. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and tried to cover them up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they were aware of everything. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments at this time.",
            "(laughs) Initially, I was somewhat okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went to Iraq as a pretext, following other factors that led to the invasion. I think the Bush administration hastily connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. That really got under my skin, and the Iraq war still really bothers me.\n\nTo be honest, it seems to me that the Bush administration was dishonest with the American people and has yet to acknowledge this fact. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by it at the time. That's a serious breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to deceive the public like that. The Bush administration appears to have disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since September 11th, at least. I believe they had a preconceived intention to go to war when they took office.\n\nThat last part reminds me of the treasury secretary who wrote in his book that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration, and was also hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run - a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nIn my opinion, it's gone on long enough. Withdrawing our troops now would likely lead to problems, as there's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and more people would die. The alternative seems to be a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either, as it could create long-term problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing its job, according to news reports. The Prime Minister has little control, and even Mugtada al-Sadr's party, which we were fighting just a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in Parliament. This is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nI don't have any suggestions for a solution that I can discuss in polite company.",
            "I'm going to try to articulate my thoughts on the War in Iraq, but I'm not entirely sure where to start. I guess it's because I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but at this point, it feels like we're staying there for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It gets down to building a democracy, but that's a long-term goal that might take forever, and in the meantime, it's just causing a lot of tension. It's hard to see how this is going to play out, and I'm not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind is that this whole thing shouldn't have been called a war in the first place, since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a key point, and it's something to consider. I'm not sure why we're still trying to stay involved, especially when it's causing so much distress both here and in Iraq. It feels like we're just trying to show off our strength, but at what cost?\n\nI've been thinking a lot about this and it's really hard for me to take a clear stance. On one hand, I feel bad for the families of soldiers who are over there, and I don't want to see them get hurt. On the other hand, I'm worried that we're causing more harm by staying there, trying to impose our values on a culture that's so different from ours. It's a delicate balance, and I'm not sure what the right answer is.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think this war is going to be resolved anytime soon. It's going to take years, and it's going to be a long and complicated process. I just wish we could find a way to move forward in a way that's less destructive and more beneficial to everyone involved.",
            "I'm not sure I agree with making it legal or illegal, as it's really a matter for the churches to decide. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be against what's already been said and written. It seems like those trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another, like how most Catholics and Christians are against it except in some areas. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can or can't make illegal. The separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the US. Even considering an amendment would be contradictory to what's already been written and would restrict people's rights rather than the government's.\n\nI'm not sure why the government is getting involved in this issue, considering it's against the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. It feels like his push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's really up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There doesn't seem to be a valid reason for the amendment, except for personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive effect on society. I think I've already covered my points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "I'd like to start by saying that I think the US government wasn't entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons behind the war in Iraq.  I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they didn't have a direct connection. This played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the traumatic events of 2001, and the invasion began in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the Iraq war is eerily similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. We lost a tremendous number of American soldiers, and it's horrible. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but they didn't have a plan for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum and chaos in its wake. The US is still trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, where they tried to push out Communists and implement democracy. However, we should have known it wouldn't be a straightforward victory, and that the outcome would be far from clear-cut.\n\nWe're dealing with a situation where we're fighting the citizens of the country, not a traditional army, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency. I think the government was underprepared for the complexities of the situation and didn't plan for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq, and it's almost 2007, with many American troops still dying and struggling to train the Iraqi security forces. I believe the US government was trying to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. However, establishing a new government takes years, and we shouldn't have been so naive about it.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and difficult struggle, with many civil wars and power struggles. It's not an easy thing to implement, and I think the government made it seem like a relatively easy feat. The decision to go to war in Iraq is a tough one, and I had similar doubts during the 2004 presidential election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was that he should finish what he started, but now I'm not so sure. It's hard to abandon the people we've gotten involved with, especially after taking away their government and way of life. On the other hand, we can't ignore the high number of American casualties and the risks we're taking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe reason we're only focusing on Iraq is likely because of the oil issue and control of resources. Before invading, we claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We're not taking the same action against countries like North Korea, which actually has these weapons. I don't think the US government is thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making process. I just hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm afraid that's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, I'm thinking, and I'm coming to the realization that I'm definitely for gay marriage. This has been my stance for a while now, and the more I learn, the more I believe that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to withhold rights from individuals based on something they can't control.\n\nTo me, this is a personal issue, not something that governments or politics should be involved in, especially at the state or federal level. I know people in my neighborhood who are openly gay, and they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, contribute to the community, and deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else.\n\nIt's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to redefine the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda. I've read and learned from various sources that there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nUltimately, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not something that's scrutinized and sensationalized by the media. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it quietly, without anyone's knowledge or approval. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's front-page news – it's just not fair.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it becomes a public forum available to everyone. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Once you put something out there, it can color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably bring it up. You can't share that kind of information publicly because the internet reaches a huge audience, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they'll likely receive that post. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in that situation, but rather an individual who took it to the school. They had to act on it because they couldn't just ignore it in case something serious did happen and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's also hard to know what to take seriously because some people just joke around online. It's like that situation we had at school where someone might have been doing an experiment for a sociology class that went wrong, or it could be a very serious issue. What happened was that someone overheard a statement made in school and reported it, and when we found out who made the comment, we looked into their online profiles, specifically Facebook, where we found some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke, but became serious in the context. \n\nWhen you put things online, there's no invasion of privacy involved. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they interpret your words. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media and snoop through their profiles, but if someone brings it to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because you gave them access by being friends. If there's a danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also think it's not right for teachers to create fake social media profiles to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to be aware of their personal lives, especially when they're posting photos that might get me involved. I don't think it's my place to know that.",
            "I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At first, I believed the purpose was noble, aimed at restoring democracy in another nation. However, it seems we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of it, almost as a way to prove our power on the global stage. I'm starting to think the original motivations were questionable, particularly considering the previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein that George Bush's father was involved in.\n\nIf our initial intention was truly to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, then that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if personal interests weren't involved. In my opinion, the war has gone on for far too long. I believe we made our point within the first few months, with the initial invasion serving as a powerful statement. But with it now stretching into years, I think it's become a drawn-out conflict.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a valid reason for the war. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, it seems we're still fighting mainly because we want to prove our determination to see it through, rather than achieving a decisive victory. I believe it's time to bring this war to an end.\n\nI think the conflict has gone on long enough, and it's time for the country's government to take responsibility for their own affairs. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. Meanwhile, we have our own internal problems, such as poverty and underfunded public services, that we should be addressing. The money spent on this war could be better used to improve our own country's infrastructure, healthcare, and education.\n\nI think we've reached a point where we need to re-evaluate our priorities. We have citizens back home who are suffering, and the money being spent on this war could be better spent on their welfare. It's time for us to reassess our involvement and bring this war to a close.",
            "Hey, I was wondering if I could clarify something. You see, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue. I think it's fair to say that when you put information on the internet, you're basically making it available for anyone to see. On sites like Myspace, for instance, if you're friends with someone, they can view your profile, and that's just how it works. I mean, if you've accepted someone as your friend on Myspace, you're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nI think that's a good thing, actually - that someone was able to notice the issue and step in. However, it's a bit complicated because schools can't really have someone monitoring students' profiles all the time to prevent problems. It's not practical, and it raises questions of fairness, like why would they single out certain students? I'm not sure it's right to have someone's job be to snoop through people's profiles.\n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just browsing profiles randomly, or was there a specific reason they were looking for something? I'm not really sure. I personally have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this documentary once about a guy who was trying to prove how easy it is to get information from people online. He got a girl's screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger - pretty creepy stuff.\n\nI've had people in my classes who I don't know, and they IM me, which is a bit unsettling. They can figure out a lot about you if you post enough information online, like your photos, class schedule, and friend list. It's a tricky balance between sharing enough to stay in touch with friends and keeping your personal stuff private. I only accept people I know on my social media, but you can never really know who's looking at your stuff.\n\nI remember hearing that my roommate's high school had a thing where students were banned from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It's a bit of a gray area, to be honest.",
            "I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War now. I mean, I've changed my mind on the matter. What really matters isn't whether I was against it from the start or not. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, and it's hard to deny that when you look at the polls. From the US to Iraq and even globally, around 75 to 80% of the population thinks it was a mistake. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops serving there believe it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure what to say, but it's clear that the situation has been disastrous from the start. It was a disaster before we invaded, and now pulling out will be difficult too. The culture clash between the US and Middle Eastern countries is massive, and I don't think we can just impose our system on them. I mean, we can't expect them to adopt democracy when it's not their choice. I'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. I just don't see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for why we should stay, but I haven't been convinced. I'd be okay with a gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's interesting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, shouldn't we listen to their opinions? If they tell us to leave, and something goes wrong, we can say we were trying to follow their lead. That way, we'll at least be the good guys, even if it's not that simple in the Middle East. Anyway, I guess that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "You brought up a really valid point about gender discrimination in the United States. I definitely think it's still an issue, and I'm not just talking about women. I think it's more about the specific industry you're in, as well. I mean, in general, women still face more obstacles, like the \"glass ceiling\" where people struggle to find opportunities to work under a female leader, even when they have the qualifications for the job. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long.\n\nIt's not just women, though; men face similar challenges in certain industries, like fashion or childcare. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and care for the kids, as if it's not a traditional role for them. They might even get judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men might be taken less seriously if they're straight, simply because people assume they don't know what fashion is about.\n\nIt's all about how society has these preconceived notions, and it's hard to change that. We've made progress, but it's slow. As more women take on leadership roles and become CEOs, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, people are starting to see things from a different perspective. But it's not just about forcing change; we need to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If we push too hard, people will resist. We're at a good point now, where change is happening gradually, and I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that isn't already being done.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, accent, or education level, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent. So, it's not just about gender; it's about how society views different groups of people.",
            "To be honest, I think decriminalizing marijuana simply means it's no longer considered a crime, but rather a minor offense, like a traffic ticket. You get cited and don't have to go through the hassle of an arrest and all that comes with it. That being said, the consequences still linger, especially when it comes to things like job interviews and other serious aspects of life. Even with decriminalization, people still worry about the long-term effects, and that doesn't just disappear.\n\nOn the other hand, it's argued that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is costly. Think about it – you've got the costs of arresting, booking, and housing them, plus the expense of multiple court appearances, public defenders, judges, and prosecutors. When you're dealing with financially struggling municipalities, some places just can't afford to make that leap, even if it would free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless.\n\nDenver, being a more open-minded city, has taken a different approach. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've actually been able to allocate more funds to valuable community programs. It's not just about being permissive; it's about being responsible and making smart financial decisions.\n\nHowever, there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of complete legalization. If it were like cigarettes, you'd have people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many places. It's a complex issue, and opinions vary widely. Some might say it's awkward to have it out in the open, while others might argue it's better to be upfront about it.\n\nPersonally, I think marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles than just their motor skills, but it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. People react differently to substances, and some can handle them better than others. It's hard to generalize, but I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree to the idea because of a few reasons. Many of their customs are deeply rooted in tradition, which has been the case for a long time. On one hand, sticking to tradition is a good thing, but on the other hand, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I think it's a bit hypocritical that some Catholics expect people to follow their doctrine to the letter but are not open to those who don't fit the mold. For instance, my parents, both from different faiths, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background.\n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church preaches love and acceptance, but it doesn't always practice what it preaches. They claim to teach love for others, but they don't always put this into action when it comes to people from different faiths. I feel like the doctrine and practice don't always align because it's become outdated, but they still stick to it anyway.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in the way some priests behave. I think that people who have a history of child abuse would likely do so regardless of whether they're married or not. Being married is not a barrier to such behavior, as it's a much more complex issue. Allowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents from occurring.\n\nBut let's focus on the positive aspects. There are some good things about the Catholic Church, and I think it would be beneficial to adapt to some of these changes.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet. I'm not sure if either side is right or wrong, but I do think this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with today. The line between separating church and state, and how we define marriage is a delicate one, and it's hard to tackle without causing offense.\n\nTo be honest, I'm torn on this one - I'm not sure if marriage should be viewed as a civil union or something more. Given that it's considered a sacrament by some, it's tricky to decide how the government should look at it. If people are baptized, they often get special tax breaks or other benefits, so I think the government should treat all unions as civil unions, regardless of their church ties. It's just about two people coming together, and the government shouldn't get involved in the details of their relationship.\n\nI also think that if we can reach a logical conclusion on this issue at a state level, it should be made into a federal law. However, pushing for a constitutional amendment just to ban gay marriage seems extreme - the constitution shouldn't be changed for something that's not a major issue. It's just not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nTo me, it's as simple as that - we shouldn't amend the constitution to define marriage or ban gay marriage. It's a matter of personal choice, and the government shouldn't interfere.",
            "To be honest, I grew up in a Christian household, which created a bit of confusion for me when it comes to homosexuality. Having close gay friends has made me think about this issue more, and while I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue that the president should decide on, but rather something that individual states should have control over.\n\nI know that many states are divided in their views, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you're living in a state that's already leaning towards accepting gay marriage, it's hard to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to make that place your home. I genuinely believe that everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not right for the president to dictate how the entire country should feel about gay marriage. George Bush, in particular, shouldn't have the authority to ban it nationwide, as he doesn't live in every state. That decision should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves. With Bush's term ending in a couple of years, I think it's just a waste of time for him to take a stance on this issue, as future presidents could just reverse his decision. Ultimately, it's the states that will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president.\n\nMy answer is clear: no, I don't think the president should have the power to decide on this issue for the whole country.",
            "Honestly, I just don't get it. Let me try to break it down. MySpace is essentially a public platform, like a bulletin board where you share things for others to see. If you post something online, it's out there for anyone to see, including school officials, not just those who access it directly through the school's account. Even if it's not under the school's name, they can still find it from their homes. So, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent something like a school shooting and saves students' lives - which is a school's responsibility - then I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to see if students are engaging in prohibited activities. I think that's an invasion of privacy, but if it leads to a safer school environment, I'm okay with it. If it's about keeping students safe, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nTo be honest, it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing rather than speaking. What I'm trying to say is that if a student posts something on Myspace and expects not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Posting something online means it's out there forever, and you never know who might see it. Even emails can come back to haunt you, and once something's on the internet, it's there to stay.\n\nIf you do something as a college student and it gets discovered later, it can cause trouble. It's not an invasion of privacy if you post something publicly. I've said it before: it's a public platform, so if officials use it to keep the school safe, I think that's fine. If they have a legitimate reason to investigate, like preventing a school shooting, then I'm okay with it.\n\nIn fact, my old teacher told me that schools have to ensure they do things like lock downs to keep students safe. It's not just about school shootings; it's about being prepared for any emergency. Even though it might seem unrelated, it's all about keeping the school safe. The school officials were just doing their job by monitoring Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like another Columbine. That's about it.",
            "Honestly, I was initially very supportive of going to war after 9/11. I was deeply affected by the event and felt a strong desire for retaliation. However, looking back, I think we rushed into it without a solid plan in place. It was an emotional response rather than a well-thought-out decision. We went in unprepared and without a clear understanding of the long-term consequences.\n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's achieved anything positive. As long as the people in the region are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to target us. It's like fighting a never-ending battle – they can't even agree with each other, let alone with us.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 made me lose interest in what happens over there. I've come to feel that they're more like savages in war, and it's not about improving their country; it's about getting rid of us. I think we should just leave and let them handle their own affairs.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe we were more driven by emotions and a desire for revenge than a rational understanding of the situation. It was a case of seeking revenge rather than solving the underlying issues. President Bush was partly driven by public opinion, and he declared war on Iraq without a clear plan. While I can see where he was coming from, I think we should have been more cautious.\n\nWe had to act after 9/11, but we could have done it in a more thoughtful and strategic way. There was a lack of unity and a clear plan for creating order in Iraq, which made things worse. I don't think we're the ones who can change those people or their ways. They'll always be like that, and it's pointless for us to stay there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify our continued presence. Once we leave, it's likely to collapse, and it's not worth the cost of staying. So, I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's due to their strict views on certain issues. I'm talking about topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While it's okay that they have strong opinions, some of these views might be seen as outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, I think they'd be less worried about losing followers.\n\nI've heard that many people, including some who were once devoted to the Catholic Church, have begun to disagree with their stance on these matters. This is because their views on issues like abortion and gay marriage might not align with the values of some individuals. As a result, people are starting to question the Church's stance and might feel that their views are outdated.\n\nTake the issue of abortion, for instance. If you're in favor of it, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community where it's strongly discouraged. The same goes for gay marriage – if you believe in it or support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's not like having a family or personal life would distract them from their devotion to God. The Church already says that priests are married to God, so why can't they have a family and dedicated relationships like everyone else in the world? It just doesn't make sense to me.",
            "Honestly, I don't have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose consciously, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. I believe it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. \n\nTo me, it seems that people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I was born straight and another person might be born gay. It's not something they can control or make a conscious decision about. It doesn't seem right to hold them responsible for something that's not their choice. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue at all. It's a personal matter that's not a security threat or a moral concern, but rather a matter of individual rights. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives or dictate who they can love. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nI'm not sure how to put it exactly, but it just seems like a matter of treating everyone with respect and equality, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think the federal government has a right to interject in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as love and relationships. \n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason not to. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. It's a completely different situation, with a multitude of factors that make it in no way comparable. It's like two sides of the same coin; you can't have heads without tails. A gay couple's relationship is built on the same fundamental aspects as a heterosexual one, with the same potential for success and satisfaction.\n\nThe issue is that same-sex couples often face unfair treatment under the law. For example, a partner may not be allowed to be with their sick loved one in the hospital or visit them because they're not considered family. This is illogical, especially considering that these couples are committed to each other for life. Studies have shown that same-sex relationships have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones, with the same factors contributing to happiness.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many couples have the same roles in their relationships, and the only difference is the sex of the partners.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, such as how a gay couple will affect their neighborhood and their children's well-being. However, these concerns are unfounded. Children of same-sex couples are no different from those of heterosexual couples; they have the same potential for success and happiness, and their parents' sexual orientation has no bearing on their upbringing.\n\nIn fact, many communities, like New York City, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and persecution in public schools. This is unacceptable. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about their love and ability to care for their children. \n\nI believe the federal government should play a significant role in making gay marriage legal across the country. The current amendment is misguided, and it's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on an entire nation, especially when it conflicts with the values of other groups. We should focus on what's fair and just, rather than what some people believe is morally right.\n\nSome people oppose gay marriage because they think gay individuals are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has stated that this is not true. We should rely on scientific research and studies, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, to understand this issue.",
            "Listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer and I wanted to share some thoughts on this. Just because a drug is considered illicit doesn't mean it's completely without benefits. I'm not saying we should make it accessible to the public, no way, not at all. However, I do think it has potential for medicinal use. It's a common misconception that just because a drug is banned, it's not beneficial. I think that's what I'm trying to get at.\n\nYeah, let me put it another way. There are plenty of controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them because they have proven benefits, even if they're not widely accepted. So, why can't the same be said for marijuana? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than the taboo surrounding it.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that comparable to alcohol. While abusing marijuana can have negative effects, so can alcohol. It's a delicate issue, but I think if we approach it carefully, we could make it work. Maybe we could regulate its use gradually, rather than making it completely legal all at once. That way, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nPeople often have a skewed view of marijuana because it's been labeled as an illicit substance. But in reality, it's not as bad as some other drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's perception of it, they might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I've been thinking about how the church has adapted to the 21st century, and it's clear that it's not as strict as it used to be. I'm not saying this as a bad thing; it's actually quite refreshing. I remember my childhood, where I'd attend church every Sunday, looking forward to seeing my friends from private school and dressing up in my favorite outfits. It was a big deal, I'd pick out a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse that complemented everything. But as I grew older, I noticed a change. They introduced a more casual, 30-minute mass, especially during the summer. People would walk in straight from the beach, and families would rush in late. Even during morning masses, where I'd always try to look polished, people started wearing jeans and khakis. It's not a bad thing; it's just a more relaxed atmosphere. The only thing I've noticed is that the church has become more laid-back. I don't know the inner workings of the church, but that's my observation.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have a problem with pedophilia, so it's not a matter of being allowed to get married or not. When someone decides to become a priest, it's a personal choice, and they're aware of their desires. Some other religions allow their clergy to be married, like Seventh-day Adventists, for example. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might consider a different faith. I think the issue is more complex than a simple solution like changing the rules.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their environment. While upbringing might play a small role, I believe it's mostly innate. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and tried to cover them up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they were aware of everything. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments at this time.",
            "(laughs) Initially, I was somewhat okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went to Iraq as a pretext, following other factors that led to the invasion. I think the Bush administration hastily connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. That really got under my skin, and the Iraq war still really bothers me.\n\nTo be honest, it seems to me that the Bush administration was dishonest with the American people and has yet to acknowledge this fact. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by it at the time. That's a serious breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to deceive the public like that. The Bush administration appears to have disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since September 11th, at least. I believe they had a preconceived intention to go to war when they took office.\n\nThat last part reminds me of the treasury secretary who wrote in his book that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration, and was also hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run - a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nIn my opinion, it's gone on long enough. Withdrawing our troops now would likely lead to problems, as there's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and more people would die. The alternative seems to be a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either, as it could create long-term problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing its job, according to news reports. The Prime Minister has little control, and even Mugtada al-Sadr's party, which we were fighting just a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in Parliament. This is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nI don't have any suggestions for a solution that I can discuss in polite company.",
            "I'm going to try to articulate my thoughts on the War in Iraq, but I'm not entirely sure where to start. I guess it's because I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but at this point, it feels like we're staying there for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It gets down to building a democracy, but that's a long-term goal that might take forever, and in the meantime, it's just causing a lot of tension. It's hard to see how this is going to play out, and I'm not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind is that this whole thing shouldn't have been called a war in the first place, since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a key point, and it's something to consider. I'm not sure why we're still trying to stay involved, especially when it's causing so much distress both here and in Iraq. It feels like we're just trying to show off our strength, but at what cost?\n\nI've been thinking a lot about this and it's really hard for me to take a clear stance. On one hand, I feel bad for the families of soldiers who are over there, and I don't want to see them get hurt. On the other hand, I'm worried that we're causing more harm by staying there, trying to impose our values on a culture that's so different from ours. It's a delicate balance, and I'm not sure what the right answer is.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think this war is going to be resolved anytime soon. It's going to take years, and it's going to be a long and complicated process. I just wish we could find a way to move forward in a way that's less destructive and more beneficial to everyone involved.",
            "I'm not sure I agree with making it legal or illegal, as it's really a matter for the churches to decide. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be against what's already been said and written. It seems like those trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another, like how most Catholics and Christians are against it except in some areas. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can or can't make illegal. The separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the US. Even considering an amendment would be contradictory to what's already been written and would restrict people's rights rather than the government's.\n\nI'm not sure why the government is getting involved in this issue, considering it's against the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. It feels like his push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's really up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There doesn't seem to be a valid reason for the amendment, except for personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive effect on society. I think I've already covered my points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "I'd like to start by saying that I think the US government wasn't entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons behind the war in Iraq.  I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they didn't have a direct connection. This played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the traumatic events of 2001, and the invasion began in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the Iraq war is eerily similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. We lost a tremendous number of American soldiers, and it's horrible. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but they didn't have a plan for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum and chaos in its wake. The US is still trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, where they tried to push out Communists and implement democracy. However, we should have known it wouldn't be a straightforward victory, and that the outcome would be far from clear-cut.\n\nWe're dealing with a situation where we're fighting the citizens of the country, not a traditional army, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency. I think the government was underprepared for the complexities of the situation and didn't plan for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq, and it's almost 2007, with many American troops still dying and struggling to train the Iraqi security forces. I believe the US government was trying to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. However, establishing a new government takes years, and we shouldn't have been so naive about it.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and difficult struggle, with many civil wars and power struggles. It's not an easy thing to implement, and I think the government made it seem like a relatively easy feat. The decision to go to war in Iraq is a tough one, and I had similar doubts during the 2004 presidential election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was that he should finish what he started, but now I'm not so sure. It's hard to abandon the people we've gotten involved with, especially after taking away their government and way of life. On the other hand, we can't ignore the high number of American casualties and the risks we're taking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe reason we're only focusing on Iraq is likely because of the oil issue and control of resources. Before invading, we claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We're not taking the same action against countries like North Korea, which actually has these weapons. I don't think the US government is thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making process. I just hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm afraid that's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, I'm thinking, and I'm coming to the realization that I'm definitely for gay marriage. This has been my stance for a while now, and the more I learn, the more I believe that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to withhold rights from individuals based on something they can't control.\n\nTo me, this is a personal issue, not something that governments or politics should be involved in, especially at the state or federal level. I know people in my neighborhood who are openly gay, and they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, contribute to the community, and deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else.\n\nIt's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to redefine the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda. I've read and learned from various sources that there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nUltimately, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not something that's scrutinized and sensationalized by the media. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it quietly, without anyone's knowledge or approval. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's front-page news – it's just not fair.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it becomes a public forum available to everyone. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Once you put something out there, it can color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably bring it up. You can't share that kind of information publicly because the internet reaches a huge audience, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they'll likely receive that post. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in that situation, but rather an individual who took it to the school. They had to act on it because they couldn't just ignore it in case something serious did happen and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's also hard to know what to take seriously because some people just joke around online. It's like that situation we had at school where someone might have been doing an experiment for a sociology class that went wrong, or it could be a very serious issue. What happened was that someone overheard a statement made in school and reported it, and when we found out who made the comment, we looked into their online profiles, specifically Facebook, where we found some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke, but became serious in the context. \n\nWhen you put things online, there's no invasion of privacy involved. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they interpret your words. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media and snoop through their profiles, but if someone brings it to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because you gave them access by being friends. If there's a danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also think it's not right for teachers to create fake social media profiles to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to be aware of their personal lives, especially when they're posting photos that might get me involved. I don't think it's my place to know that.",
            "I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At first, I believed the purpose was noble, aimed at restoring democracy in another nation. However, it seems we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of it, almost as a way to prove our power on the global stage. I'm starting to think the original motivations were questionable, particularly considering the previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein that George Bush's father was involved in.\n\nIf our initial intention was truly to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, then that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if personal interests weren't involved. In my opinion, the war has gone on for far too long. I believe we made our point within the first few months, with the initial invasion serving as a powerful statement. But with it now stretching into years, I think it's become a drawn-out conflict.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a valid reason for the war. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, it seems we're still fighting mainly because we want to prove our determination to see it through, rather than achieving a decisive victory. I believe it's time to bring this war to an end.\n\nI think the conflict has gone on long enough, and it's time for the country's government to take responsibility for their own affairs. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. Meanwhile, we have our own internal problems, such as poverty and underfunded public services, that we should be addressing. The money spent on this war could be better used to improve our own country's infrastructure, healthcare, and education.\n\nI think we've reached a point where we need to re-evaluate our priorities. We have citizens back home who are suffering, and the money being spent on this war could be better spent on their welfare. It's time for us to reassess our involvement and bring this war to a close.",
            "Hey, I was wondering if I could clarify something. You see, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue. I think it's fair to say that when you put information on the internet, you're basically making it available for anyone to see. On sites like Myspace, for instance, if you're friends with someone, they can view your profile, and that's just how it works. I mean, if you've accepted someone as your friend on Myspace, you're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nI think that's a good thing, actually - that someone was able to notice the issue and step in. However, it's a bit complicated because schools can't really have someone monitoring students' profiles all the time to prevent problems. It's not practical, and it raises questions of fairness, like why would they single out certain students? I'm not sure it's right to have someone's job be to snoop through people's profiles.\n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just browsing profiles randomly, or was there a specific reason they were looking for something? I'm not really sure. I personally have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this documentary once about a guy who was trying to prove how easy it is to get information from people online. He got a girl's screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger - pretty creepy stuff.\n\nI've had people in my classes who I don't know, and they IM me, which is a bit unsettling. They can figure out a lot about you if you post enough information online, like your photos, class schedule, and friend list. It's a tricky balance between sharing enough to stay in touch with friends and keeping your personal stuff private. I only accept people I know on my social media, but you can never really know who's looking at your stuff.\n\nI remember hearing that my roommate's high school had a thing where students were banned from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It's a bit of a gray area, to be honest.",
            "I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War now. I mean, I've changed my mind on the matter. What really matters isn't whether I was against it from the start or not. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, and it's hard to deny that when you look at the polls. From the US to Iraq and even globally, around 75 to 80% of the population thinks it was a mistake. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops serving there believe it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure what to say, but it's clear that the situation has been disastrous from the start. It was a disaster before we invaded, and now pulling out will be difficult too. The culture clash between the US and Middle Eastern countries is massive, and I don't think we can just impose our system on them. I mean, we can't expect them to adopt democracy when it's not their choice. I'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. I just don't see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for why we should stay, but I haven't been convinced. I'd be okay with a gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's interesting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, shouldn't we listen to their opinions? If they tell us to leave, and something goes wrong, we can say we were trying to follow their lead. That way, we'll at least be the good guys, even if it's not that simple in the Middle East. Anyway, I guess that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "You brought up a really valid point about gender discrimination in the United States. I definitely think it's still an issue, and I'm not just talking about women. I think it's more about the specific industry you're in, as well. I mean, in general, women still face more obstacles, like the \"glass ceiling\" where people struggle to find opportunities to work under a female leader, even when they have the qualifications for the job. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long.\n\nIt's not just women, though; men face similar challenges in certain industries, like fashion or childcare. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and care for the kids, as if it's not a traditional role for them. They might even get judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men might be taken less seriously if they're straight, simply because people assume they don't know what fashion is about.\n\nIt's all about how society has these preconceived notions, and it's hard to change that. We've made progress, but it's slow. As more women take on leadership roles and become CEOs, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, people are starting to see things from a different perspective. But it's not just about forcing change; we need to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If we push too hard, people will resist. We're at a good point now, where change is happening gradually, and I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that isn't already being done.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, accent, or education level, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent. So, it's not just about gender; it's about how society views different groups of people.",
            "To be honest, I think decriminalizing marijuana simply means it's no longer considered a crime, but rather a minor offense, like a traffic ticket. You get cited and don't have to go through the hassle of an arrest and all that comes with it. That being said, the consequences still linger, especially when it comes to things like job interviews and other serious aspects of life. Even with decriminalization, people still worry about the long-term effects, and that doesn't just disappear.\n\nOn the other hand, it's argued that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is costly. Think about it – you've got the costs of arresting, booking, and housing them, plus the expense of multiple court appearances, public defenders, judges, and prosecutors. When you're dealing with financially struggling municipalities, some places just can't afford to make that leap, even if it would free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless.\n\nDenver, being a more open-minded city, has taken a different approach. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've actually been able to allocate more funds to valuable community programs. It's not just about being permissive; it's about being responsible and making smart financial decisions.\n\nHowever, there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of complete legalization. If it were like cigarettes, you'd have people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many places. It's a complex issue, and opinions vary widely. Some might say it's awkward to have it out in the open, while others might argue it's better to be upfront about it.\n\nPersonally, I think marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles than just their motor skills, but it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. People react differently to substances, and some can handle them better than others. It's hard to generalize, but I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree to the idea because of a few reasons. Many of their customs are deeply rooted in tradition, which has been the case for a long time. On one hand, sticking to tradition is a good thing, but on the other hand, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I think it's a bit hypocritical that some Catholics expect people to follow their doctrine to the letter but are not open to those who don't fit the mold. For instance, my parents, both from different faiths, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background.\n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church preaches love and acceptance, but it doesn't always practice what it preaches. They claim to teach love for others, but they don't always put this into action when it comes to people from different faiths. I feel like the doctrine and practice don't always align because it's become outdated, but they still stick to it anyway.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in the way some priests behave. I think that people who have a history of child abuse would likely do so regardless of whether they're married or not. Being married is not a barrier to such behavior, as it's a much more complex issue. Allowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents from occurring.\n\nBut let's focus on the positive aspects. There are some good things about the Catholic Church, and I think it would be beneficial to adapt to some of these changes.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet. I'm not sure if either side is right or wrong, but I do think this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with today. The line between separating church and state, and how we define marriage is a delicate one, and it's hard to tackle without causing offense.\n\nTo be honest, I'm torn on this one - I'm not sure if marriage should be viewed as a civil union or something more. Given that it's considered a sacrament by some, it's tricky to decide how the government should look at it. If people are baptized, they often get special tax breaks or other benefits, so I think the government should treat all unions as civil unions, regardless of their church ties. It's just about two people coming together, and the government shouldn't get involved in the details of their relationship.\n\nI also think that if we can reach a logical conclusion on this issue at a state level, it should be made into a federal law. However, pushing for a constitutional amendment just to ban gay marriage seems extreme - the constitution shouldn't be changed for something that's not a major issue. It's just not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nTo me, it's as simple as that - we shouldn't amend the constitution to define marriage or ban gay marriage. It's a matter of personal choice, and the government shouldn't interfere.",
            "To be honest, I grew up in a Christian household, which created a bit of confusion for me when it comes to homosexuality. Having close gay friends has made me think about this issue more, and while I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue that the president should decide on, but rather something that individual states should have control over.\n\nI know that many states are divided in their views, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you're living in a state that's already leaning towards accepting gay marriage, it's hard to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to make that place your home. I genuinely believe that everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not right for the president to dictate how the entire country should feel about gay marriage. George Bush, in particular, shouldn't have the authority to ban it nationwide, as he doesn't live in every state. That decision should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves. With Bush's term ending in a couple of years, I think it's just a waste of time for him to take a stance on this issue, as future presidents could just reverse his decision. Ultimately, it's the states that will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president.\n\nMy answer is clear: no, I don't think the president should have the power to decide on this issue for the whole country.",
            "Honestly, I just don't get it. Let me try to break it down. MySpace is essentially a public platform, like a bulletin board where you share things for others to see. If you post something online, it's out there for anyone to see, including school officials, not just those who access it directly through the school's account. Even if it's not under the school's name, they can still find it from their homes. So, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent something like a school shooting and saves students' lives - which is a school's responsibility - then I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to see if students are engaging in prohibited activities. I think that's an invasion of privacy, but if it leads to a safer school environment, I'm okay with it. If it's about keeping students safe, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nTo be honest, it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing rather than speaking. What I'm trying to say is that if a student posts something on Myspace and expects not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Posting something online means it's out there forever, and you never know who might see it. Even emails can come back to haunt you, and once something's on the internet, it's there to stay.\n\nIf you do something as a college student and it gets discovered later, it can cause trouble. It's not an invasion of privacy if you post something publicly. I've said it before: it's a public platform, so if officials use it to keep the school safe, I think that's fine. If they have a legitimate reason to investigate, like preventing a school shooting, then I'm okay with it.\n\nIn fact, my old teacher told me that schools have to ensure they do things like lock downs to keep students safe. It's not just about school shootings; it's about being prepared for any emergency. Even though it might seem unrelated, it's all about keeping the school safe. The school officials were just doing their job by monitoring Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like another Columbine. That's about it.",
            "Honestly, I was initially very supportive of going to war after 9/11. I was deeply affected by the event and felt a strong desire for retaliation. However, looking back, I think we rushed into it without a solid plan in place. It was an emotional response rather than a well-thought-out decision. We went in unprepared and without a clear understanding of the long-term consequences.\n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's achieved anything positive. As long as the people in the region are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to target us. It's like fighting a never-ending battle – they can't even agree with each other, let alone with us.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 made me lose interest in what happens over there. I've come to feel that they're more like savages in war, and it's not about improving their country; it's about getting rid of us. I think we should just leave and let them handle their own affairs.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe we were more driven by emotions and a desire for revenge than a rational understanding of the situation. It was a case of seeking revenge rather than solving the underlying issues. President Bush was partly driven by public opinion, and he declared war on Iraq without a clear plan. While I can see where he was coming from, I think we should have been more cautious.\n\nWe had to act after 9/11, but we could have done it in a more thoughtful and strategic way. There was a lack of unity and a clear plan for creating order in Iraq, which made things worse. I don't think we're the ones who can change those people or their ways. They'll always be like that, and it's pointless for us to stay there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify our continued presence. Once we leave, it's likely to collapse, and it's not worth the cost of staying. So, I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's due to their strict views on certain issues. I'm talking about topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While it's okay that they have strong opinions, some of these views might be seen as outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, I think they'd be less worried about losing followers.\n\nI've heard that many people, including some who were once devoted to the Catholic Church, have begun to disagree with their stance on these matters. This is because their views on issues like abortion and gay marriage might not align with the values of some individuals. As a result, people are starting to question the Church's stance and might feel that their views are outdated.\n\nTake the issue of abortion, for instance. If you're in favor of it, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community where it's strongly discouraged. The same goes for gay marriage – if you believe in it or support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's not like having a family or personal life would distract them from their devotion to God. The Church already says that priests are married to God, so why can't they have a family and dedicated relationships like everyone else in the world? It just doesn't make sense to me.",
            "Honestly, I don't have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose consciously, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. I believe it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. \n\nTo me, it seems that people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I was born straight and another person might be born gay. It's not something they can control or make a conscious decision about. It doesn't seem right to hold them responsible for something that's not their choice. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue at all. It's a personal matter that's not a security threat or a moral concern, but rather a matter of individual rights. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives or dictate who they can love. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nI'm not sure how to put it exactly, but it just seems like a matter of treating everyone with respect and equality, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think the federal government has a right to interject in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as love and relationships. \n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason not to. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. It's a completely different situation, with a multitude of factors that make it in no way comparable. It's like two sides of the same coin; you can't have heads without tails. A gay couple's relationship is built on the same fundamental aspects as a heterosexual one, with the same potential for success and satisfaction.\n\nThe issue is that same-sex couples often face unfair treatment under the law. For example, a partner may not be allowed to be with their sick loved one in the hospital or visit them because they're not considered family. This is illogical, especially considering that these couples are committed to each other for life. Studies have shown that same-sex relationships have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones, with the same factors contributing to happiness.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many couples have the same roles in their relationships, and the only difference is the sex of the partners.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, such as how a gay couple will affect their neighborhood and their children's well-being. However, these concerns are unfounded. Children of same-sex couples are no different from those of heterosexual couples; they have the same potential for success and happiness, and their parents' sexual orientation has no bearing on their upbringing.\n\nIn fact, many communities, like New York City, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and persecution in public schools. This is unacceptable. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about their love and ability to care for their children. \n\nI believe the federal government should play a significant role in making gay marriage legal across the country. The current amendment is misguided, and it's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on an entire nation, especially when it conflicts with the values of other groups. We should focus on what's fair and just, rather than what some people believe is morally right.\n\nSome people oppose gay marriage because they think gay individuals are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has stated that this is not true. We should rely on scientific research and studies, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, to understand this issue.",
            "Listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer and I wanted to share some thoughts on this. Just because a drug is considered illicit doesn't mean it's completely without benefits. I'm not saying we should make it accessible to the public, no way, not at all. However, I do think it has potential for medicinal use. It's a common misconception that just because a drug is banned, it's not beneficial. I think that's what I'm trying to get at.\n\nYeah, let me put it another way. There are plenty of controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them because they have proven benefits, even if they're not widely accepted. So, why can't the same be said for marijuana? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than the taboo surrounding it.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that comparable to alcohol. While abusing marijuana can have negative effects, so can alcohol. It's a delicate issue, but I think if we approach it carefully, we could make it work. Maybe we could regulate its use gradually, rather than making it completely legal all at once. That way, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nPeople often have a skewed view of marijuana because it's been labeled as an illicit substance. But in reality, it's not as bad as some other drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's perception of it, they might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I've been thinking about how the church has adapted to the 21st century, and it's clear that it's not as strict as it used to be. I'm not saying this as a bad thing; it's actually quite refreshing. I remember my childhood, where I'd attend church every Sunday, looking forward to seeing my friends from private school and dressing up in my favorite outfits. It was a big deal, I'd pick out a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse that complemented everything. But as I grew older, I noticed a change. They introduced a more casual, 30-minute mass, especially during the summer. People would walk in straight from the beach, and families would rush in late. Even during morning masses, where I'd always try to look polished, people started wearing jeans and khakis. It's not a bad thing; it's just a more relaxed atmosphere. The only thing I've noticed is that the church has become more laid-back. I don't know the inner workings of the church, but that's my observation.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have a problem with pedophilia, so it's not a matter of being allowed to get married or not. When someone decides to become a priest, it's a personal choice, and they're aware of their desires. Some other religions allow their clergy to be married, like Seventh-day Adventists, for example. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might consider a different faith. I think the issue is more complex than a simple solution like changing the rules.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their environment. While upbringing might play a small role, I believe it's mostly innate. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and tried to cover them up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they were aware of everything. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments at this time.",
            "(laughs) Initially, I was somewhat okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went to Iraq as a pretext, following other factors that led to the invasion. I think the Bush administration hastily connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. That really got under my skin, and the Iraq war still really bothers me.\n\nTo be honest, it seems to me that the Bush administration was dishonest with the American people and has yet to acknowledge this fact. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by it at the time. That's a serious breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to deceive the public like that. The Bush administration appears to have disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since September 11th, at least. I believe they had a preconceived intention to go to war when they took office.\n\nThat last part reminds me of the treasury secretary who wrote in his book that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration, and was also hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run - a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nIn my opinion, it's gone on long enough. Withdrawing our troops now would likely lead to problems, as there's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and more people would die. The alternative seems to be a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either, as it could create long-term problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing its job, according to news reports. The Prime Minister has little control, and even Mugtada al-Sadr's party, which we were fighting just a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in Parliament. This is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nI don't have any suggestions for a solution that I can discuss in polite company.",
            "I'm going to try to articulate my thoughts on the War in Iraq, but I'm not entirely sure where to start. I guess it's because I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but at this point, it feels like we're staying there for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It gets down to building a democracy, but that's a long-term goal that might take forever, and in the meantime, it's just causing a lot of tension. It's hard to see how this is going to play out, and I'm not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind is that this whole thing shouldn't have been called a war in the first place, since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a key point, and it's something to consider. I'm not sure why we're still trying to stay involved, especially when it's causing so much distress both here and in Iraq. It feels like we're just trying to show off our strength, but at what cost?\n\nI've been thinking a lot about this and it's really hard for me to take a clear stance. On one hand, I feel bad for the families of soldiers who are over there, and I don't want to see them get hurt. On the other hand, I'm worried that we're causing more harm by staying there, trying to impose our values on a culture that's so different from ours. It's a delicate balance, and I'm not sure what the right answer is.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think this war is going to be resolved anytime soon. It's going to take years, and it's going to be a long and complicated process. I just wish we could find a way to move forward in a way that's less destructive and more beneficial to everyone involved.",
            "I'm not sure I agree with making it legal or illegal, as it's really a matter for the churches to decide. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be against what's already been said and written. It seems like those trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another, like how most Catholics and Christians are against it except in some areas. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can or can't make illegal. The separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the US. Even considering an amendment would be contradictory to what's already been written and would restrict people's rights rather than the government's.\n\nI'm not sure why the government is getting involved in this issue, considering it's against the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. It feels like his push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's really up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There doesn't seem to be a valid reason for the amendment, except for personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive effect on society. I think I've already covered my points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "I'd like to start by saying that I think the US government wasn't entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons behind the war in Iraq.  I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they didn't have a direct connection. This played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the traumatic events of 2001, and the invasion began in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the Iraq war is eerily similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. We lost a tremendous number of American soldiers, and it's horrible. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but they didn't have a plan for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum and chaos in its wake. The US is still trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, where they tried to push out Communists and implement democracy. However, we should have known it wouldn't be a straightforward victory, and that the outcome would be far from clear-cut.\n\nWe're dealing with a situation where we're fighting the citizens of the country, not a traditional army, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency. I think the government was underprepared for the complexities of the situation and didn't plan for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq, and it's almost 2007, with many American troops still dying and struggling to train the Iraqi security forces. I believe the US government was trying to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. However, establishing a new government takes years, and we shouldn't have been so naive about it.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and difficult struggle, with many civil wars and power struggles. It's not an easy thing to implement, and I think the government made it seem like a relatively easy feat. The decision to go to war in Iraq is a tough one, and I had similar doubts during the 2004 presidential election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was that he should finish what he started, but now I'm not so sure. It's hard to abandon the people we've gotten involved with, especially after taking away their government and way of life. On the other hand, we can't ignore the high number of American casualties and the risks we're taking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe reason we're only focusing on Iraq is likely because of the oil issue and control of resources. Before invading, we claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We're not taking the same action against countries like North Korea, which actually has these weapons. I don't think the US government is thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making process. I just hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm afraid that's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, I'm thinking, and I'm coming to the realization that I'm definitely for gay marriage. This has been my stance for a while now, and the more I learn, the more I believe that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to withhold rights from individuals based on something they can't control.\n\nTo me, this is a personal issue, not something that governments or politics should be involved in, especially at the state or federal level. I know people in my neighborhood who are openly gay, and they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, contribute to the community, and deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else.\n\nIt's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to redefine the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda. I've read and learned from various sources that there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nUltimately, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not something that's scrutinized and sensationalized by the media. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it quietly, without anyone's knowledge or approval. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's front-page news – it's just not fair.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it becomes a public forum available to everyone. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Once you put something out there, it can color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably bring it up. You can't share that kind of information publicly because the internet reaches a huge audience, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they'll likely receive that post. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in that situation, but rather an individual who took it to the school. They had to act on it because they couldn't just ignore it in case something serious did happen and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's also hard to know what to take seriously because some people just joke around online. It's like that situation we had at school where someone might have been doing an experiment for a sociology class that went wrong, or it could be a very serious issue. What happened was that someone overheard a statement made in school and reported it, and when we found out who made the comment, we looked into their online profiles, specifically Facebook, where we found some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke, but became serious in the context. \n\nWhen you put things online, there's no invasion of privacy involved. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they interpret your words. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media and snoop through their profiles, but if someone brings it to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because you gave them access by being friends. If there's a danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also think it's not right for teachers to create fake social media profiles to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to be aware of their personal lives, especially when they're posting photos that might get me involved. I don't think it's my place to know that.",
            "I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At first, I believed the purpose was noble, aimed at restoring democracy in another nation. However, it seems we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of it, almost as a way to prove our power on the global stage. I'm starting to think the original motivations were questionable, particularly considering the previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein that George Bush's father was involved in.\n\nIf our initial intention was truly to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, then that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if personal interests weren't involved. In my opinion, the war has gone on for far too long. I believe we made our point within the first few months, with the initial invasion serving as a powerful statement. But with it now stretching into years, I think it's become a drawn-out conflict.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a valid reason for the war. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, it seems we're still fighting mainly because we want to prove our determination to see it through, rather than achieving a decisive victory. I believe it's time to bring this war to an end.\n\nI think the conflict has gone on long enough, and it's time for the country's government to take responsibility for their own affairs. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. Meanwhile, we have our own internal problems, such as poverty and underfunded public services, that we should be addressing. The money spent on this war could be better used to improve our own country's infrastructure, healthcare, and education.\n\nI think we've reached a point where we need to re-evaluate our priorities. We have citizens back home who are suffering, and the money being spent on this war could be better spent on their welfare. It's time for us to reassess our involvement and bring this war to a close.",
            "Hey, I was wondering if I could clarify something. You see, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue. I think it's fair to say that when you put information on the internet, you're basically making it available for anyone to see. On sites like Myspace, for instance, if you're friends with someone, they can view your profile, and that's just how it works. I mean, if you've accepted someone as your friend on Myspace, you're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nI think that's a good thing, actually - that someone was able to notice the issue and step in. However, it's a bit complicated because schools can't really have someone monitoring students' profiles all the time to prevent problems. It's not practical, and it raises questions of fairness, like why would they single out certain students? I'm not sure it's right to have someone's job be to snoop through people's profiles.\n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just browsing profiles randomly, or was there a specific reason they were looking for something? I'm not really sure. I personally have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this documentary once about a guy who was trying to prove how easy it is to get information from people online. He got a girl's screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger - pretty creepy stuff.\n\nI've had people in my classes who I don't know, and they IM me, which is a bit unsettling. They can figure out a lot about you if you post enough information online, like your photos, class schedule, and friend list. It's a tricky balance between sharing enough to stay in touch with friends and keeping your personal stuff private. I only accept people I know on my social media, but you can never really know who's looking at your stuff.\n\nI remember hearing that my roommate's high school had a thing where students were banned from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It's a bit of a gray area, to be honest.",
            "I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War now. I mean, I've changed my mind on the matter. What really matters isn't whether I was against it from the start or not. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, and it's hard to deny that when you look at the polls. From the US to Iraq and even globally, around 75 to 80% of the population thinks it was a mistake. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops serving there believe it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure what to say, but it's clear that the situation has been disastrous from the start. It was a disaster before we invaded, and now pulling out will be difficult too. The culture clash between the US and Middle Eastern countries is massive, and I don't think we can just impose our system on them. I mean, we can't expect them to adopt democracy when it's not their choice. I'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. I just don't see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for why we should stay, but I haven't been convinced. I'd be okay with a gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's interesting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, shouldn't we listen to their opinions? If they tell us to leave, and something goes wrong, we can say we were trying to follow their lead. That way, we'll at least be the good guys, even if it's not that simple in the Middle East. Anyway, I guess that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "You brought up a really valid point about gender discrimination in the United States. I definitely think it's still an issue, and I'm not just talking about women. I think it's more about the specific industry you're in, as well. I mean, in general, women still face more obstacles, like the \"glass ceiling\" where people struggle to find opportunities to work under a female leader, even when they have the qualifications for the job. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long.\n\nIt's not just women, though; men face similar challenges in certain industries, like fashion or childcare. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and care for the kids, as if it's not a traditional role for them. They might even get judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men might be taken less seriously if they're straight, simply because people assume they don't know what fashion is about.\n\nIt's all about how society has these preconceived notions, and it's hard to change that. We've made progress, but it's slow. As more women take on leadership roles and become CEOs, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, people are starting to see things from a different perspective. But it's not just about forcing change; we need to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If we push too hard, people will resist. We're at a good point now, where change is happening gradually, and I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that isn't already being done.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, accent, or education level, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent. So, it's not just about gender; it's about how society views different groups of people.",
            "To be honest, I think decriminalizing marijuana simply means it's no longer considered a crime, but rather a minor offense, like a traffic ticket. You get cited and don't have to go through the hassle of an arrest and all that comes with it. That being said, the consequences still linger, especially when it comes to things like job interviews and other serious aspects of life. Even with decriminalization, people still worry about the long-term effects, and that doesn't just disappear.\n\nOn the other hand, it's argued that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is costly. Think about it – you've got the costs of arresting, booking, and housing them, plus the expense of multiple court appearances, public defenders, judges, and prosecutors. When you're dealing with financially struggling municipalities, some places just can't afford to make that leap, even if it would free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless.\n\nDenver, being a more open-minded city, has taken a different approach. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've actually been able to allocate more funds to valuable community programs. It's not just about being permissive; it's about being responsible and making smart financial decisions.\n\nHowever, there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of complete legalization. If it were like cigarettes, you'd have people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many places. It's a complex issue, and opinions vary widely. Some might say it's awkward to have it out in the open, while others might argue it's better to be upfront about it.\n\nPersonally, I think marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles than just their motor skills, but it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. People react differently to substances, and some can handle them better than others. It's hard to generalize, but I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree to the idea because of a few reasons. Many of their customs are deeply rooted in tradition, which has been the case for a long time. On one hand, sticking to tradition is a good thing, but on the other hand, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I think it's a bit hypocritical that some Catholics expect people to follow their doctrine to the letter but are not open to those who don't fit the mold. For instance, my parents, both from different faiths, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background.\n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church preaches love and acceptance, but it doesn't always practice what it preaches. They claim to teach love for others, but they don't always put this into action when it comes to people from different faiths. I feel like the doctrine and practice don't always align because it's become outdated, but they still stick to it anyway.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in the way some priests behave. I think that people who have a history of child abuse would likely do so regardless of whether they're married or not. Being married is not a barrier to such behavior, as it's a much more complex issue. Allowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents from occurring.\n\nBut let's focus on the positive aspects. There are some good things about the Catholic Church, and I think it would be beneficial to adapt to some of these changes.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet. I'm not sure if either side is right or wrong, but I do think this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with today. The line between separating church and state, and how we define marriage is a delicate one, and it's hard to tackle without causing offense.\n\nTo be honest, I'm torn on this one - I'm not sure if marriage should be viewed as a civil union or something more. Given that it's considered a sacrament by some, it's tricky to decide how the government should look at it. If people are baptized, they often get special tax breaks or other benefits, so I think the government should treat all unions as civil unions, regardless of their church ties. It's just about two people coming together, and the government shouldn't get involved in the details of their relationship.\n\nI also think that if we can reach a logical conclusion on this issue at a state level, it should be made into a federal law. However, pushing for a constitutional amendment just to ban gay marriage seems extreme - the constitution shouldn't be changed for something that's not a major issue. It's just not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nTo me, it's as simple as that - we shouldn't amend the constitution to define marriage or ban gay marriage. It's a matter of personal choice, and the government shouldn't interfere.",
            "To be honest, I grew up in a Christian household, which created a bit of confusion for me when it comes to homosexuality. Having close gay friends has made me think about this issue more, and while I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue that the president should decide on, but rather something that individual states should have control over.\n\nI know that many states are divided in their views, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you're living in a state that's already leaning towards accepting gay marriage, it's hard to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to make that place your home. I genuinely believe that everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not right for the president to dictate how the entire country should feel about gay marriage. George Bush, in particular, shouldn't have the authority to ban it nationwide, as he doesn't live in every state. That decision should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves. With Bush's term ending in a couple of years, I think it's just a waste of time for him to take a stance on this issue, as future presidents could just reverse his decision. Ultimately, it's the states that will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president.\n\nMy answer is clear: no, I don't think the president should have the power to decide on this issue for the whole country.",
            "Honestly, I just don't get it. Let me try to break it down. MySpace is essentially a public platform, like a bulletin board where you share things for others to see. If you post something online, it's out there for anyone to see, including school officials, not just those who access it directly through the school's account. Even if it's not under the school's name, they can still find it from their homes. So, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent something like a school shooting and saves students' lives - which is a school's responsibility - then I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to see if students are engaging in prohibited activities. I think that's an invasion of privacy, but if it leads to a safer school environment, I'm okay with it. If it's about keeping students safe, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nTo be honest, it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing rather than speaking. What I'm trying to say is that if a student posts something on Myspace and expects not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Posting something online means it's out there forever, and you never know who might see it. Even emails can come back to haunt you, and once something's on the internet, it's there to stay.\n\nIf you do something as a college student and it gets discovered later, it can cause trouble. It's not an invasion of privacy if you post something publicly. I've said it before: it's a public platform, so if officials use it to keep the school safe, I think that's fine. If they have a legitimate reason to investigate, like preventing a school shooting, then I'm okay with it.\n\nIn fact, my old teacher told me that schools have to ensure they do things like lock downs to keep students safe. It's not just about school shootings; it's about being prepared for any emergency. Even though it might seem unrelated, it's all about keeping the school safe. The school officials were just doing their job by monitoring Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like another Columbine. That's about it.",
            "Honestly, I was initially very supportive of going to war after 9/11. I was deeply affected by the event and felt a strong desire for retaliation. However, looking back, I think we rushed into it without a solid plan in place. It was an emotional response rather than a well-thought-out decision. We went in unprepared and without a clear understanding of the long-term consequences.\n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's achieved anything positive. As long as the people in the region are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to target us. It's like fighting a never-ending battle – they can't even agree with each other, let alone with us.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 made me lose interest in what happens over there. I've come to feel that they're more like savages in war, and it's not about improving their country; it's about getting rid of us. I think we should just leave and let them handle their own affairs.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe we were more driven by emotions and a desire for revenge than a rational understanding of the situation. It was a case of seeking revenge rather than solving the underlying issues. President Bush was partly driven by public opinion, and he declared war on Iraq without a clear plan. While I can see where he was coming from, I think we should have been more cautious.\n\nWe had to act after 9/11, but we could have done it in a more thoughtful and strategic way. There was a lack of unity and a clear plan for creating order in Iraq, which made things worse. I don't think we're the ones who can change those people or their ways. They'll always be like that, and it's pointless for us to stay there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify our continued presence. Once we leave, it's likely to collapse, and it's not worth the cost of staying. So, I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Their views on certain issues might be causing them to lose followers. I think this is because the Church isn't very accepting of many things. For instance, when it comes to gay marriages, abortions, and birth control, the Church has very strong views, but they may be a bit outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, they'd likely worry less about losing their following.\n\nI've noticed that some people are starting to turn against the Church due to their stance on these issues. This is because people have different views on these subjects, and they feel that the Church is holding the wrong views. For example, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't agree with that.\n\nIt's interesting to think about why the Church is against things like female priests and priests being married. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe if priests were allowed to be married or if women could be priests, things would be different, but I'm not convinced it would have made a significant difference.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married, considering the Church views them as being married to God and devoted to their lives as priests. It's like any other job - people have their professional lives and their personal lives. The fact that priests can't have both seems outdated.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that I've given this a lot of thought, and I don't actually have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. It seems unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their sexual orientation. I mean, think about it - people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I'm straight and others are gay. It's not something they can switch or change at will. I don't think the government should be involved in this, as it's not a matter of security or morality - it's a personal issue that doesn't concern them. To me, it's just about treating people with respect and allowing them to live their lives as they are. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who can and can't get married based on their orientation. It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nIn fact, it's kind of simple - the government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives unless it affects the country's security or well-being. But this isn't about that. It's about two people loving each other and wanting to get married. I don't think the government should be in a position to deny them that. It's just common sense, you know? Let people be who they are and live their lives without the government breathing down their necks. It's really not that complicated.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I think it's wrong to deny gay people the right to get married. It's just basic human decency. They shouldn't be punished for being who they are, and the government shouldn't be involved in their personal lives. It's as simple as that.\n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it - I think the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not their call. People should be free to love who they want and get married to whoever they choose, without the government getting in the way.\n\nI'm not going to dwell on this anymore, but I just wanted to share my thoughts. I hope that makes sense.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct things that can't be equated. Each side of the coin is unique, and it's not fair to judge one over the other. The truth is, homosexual couples have the same rights as everyone else, like having their partner by their side in times of need, even in a hospital or when it comes to tax laws and healthcare benefits.\n\nIt's ridiculous that partners in a same-sex relationship can't be considered family in the eyes of the law. They're committed to each other, and that's what matters most. Scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples, which is a clear indication that love is love, regardless of orientation.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that homosexual couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church ceremony. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are no different from straight couples in many ways, like the roles they play in their relationships.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about adoption, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these are just new issues that we're still learning about. However, it's hard to deny the fact that children from gay parents are just as capable and deserving of love and respect as any other child. In fact, some schools in cities like New York City even have special programs for kids from gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nThe real issue is that the government should take a stand on this matter and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The current amendment opposing it is a clear example of hypocrisy, as it goes against the principles of equality and freedom that America claims to uphold. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" pledge shows that people are willing to challenge laws that enforce religious standards, so why not apply the same logic to gay marriage?\n\nOne of the main reasons people are against gay marriage is the misconception that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims, and it's time we listen to the experts rather than popular opinion or personal biases. If we did, we'd see the world in a different light and recognize the beauty of love in all its forms.",
            "Okay, let's get this straight. I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I want to make one thing clear: just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. I mean, think about it - there are plenty of prescription meds that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them all the time to help people, and that's exactly what I think we should be doing with marijuana.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is that different from other substances that are abused, like alcohol. Sure, abusing it can lead to problems, but so can abusing alcohol. It's a tough one, I'll admit it. But I think we should take a step back and look at the benefits of marijuana. If we could remove the stigma around it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes. It's not some evil substance like heroin or cocaine - it's got its own set of risks and benefits.\n\nIf we're going to make it available to the public, it shouldn't be all or nothing. A gradual approach might work better, but first, we need to change the way people think about marijuana. It's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, and if we can get past that, maybe we can use it to help people instead of shunning it. That's my two cents, anyway.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. I've noticed this change since I was a kid, going to church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little outfit and matching accessories. I went to a private school and church was a big part of my weekend routine, seeing my friends there was always a highlight. Now, they've introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, which is only 30 minutes long, and people dress in casual attire, especially during summer. It's become more laid-back, even at morning masses where I used to dress up, now people wear jeans and khakis. I think this shift is noticeable, it's the biggest change I've seen. As for other things, that's pretty much it, I don't really know the church's politics, but that's my take on it. \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these situations. There are men who are married and still become pedophiles, it's not about their marital status. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and there are other religions where they can be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I think pedophilia is rooted in genetics, people are born with these tendencies, and it's not something that can be hidden or changed through marriage. The church can't prevent something that's innate, and if they knew about it and covered it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they always knew. As for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have any.",
            "(laughs) \nAt first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we entered Iraq using it as a pretext, with various reasons leading us into the conflict. I believe the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and still hasn't taken responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave that pivotal speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power and an impeachable offense.\n\nI think the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. When I think back to that time, it's clear that the administration had it out for Saddam Hussein, partly due to a grudge carried over from his dad's administration, and also to expand our energy supply – which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI'm not sure how long this can go on, but I believe withdrawing now could be problematic, as there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in more deaths. The current alternative, where the UN and US are considering a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, doesn't seem like a great idea to me. This could create more long-term issues, particularly with Iraq's sovereignty, as it appears the interim government is disintegrating. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the situation.\n\nWith groups like Mugtada al-Sadr's party holding significant power in the Iraqi Parliament and radical elements vying for control, the political process is experiencing significant friction. I'm not sure I can articulate all the issues in polite conversation, but it's clear this is a complex and messy situation.",
            "I'm really struggling to find the right words on this. Okay, let's get the basics out of the way first. To be honest, I don't know much about the Iraq War. I mean, it wasn't officially declared as a war, which already makes it tricky to discuss. I think it started as a sort of revenge for 9/11, targeting the people we believed were responsible. But, to be frank, I don't follow this closely, and I'm not sure about all the details. As far as I understand, we're trying to build a democracy in Iraq, making it more like the US, and also securing oil resources. However, this approach is causing a lot of tension and distress.\n\nWe're stuck between a rock and a hard place. If we stay, we'll be tasked with building a democracy, which can't be done overnight, and it'll take a lot of time and effort. But, if we leave, the Iraqis will be left to deal with the mess we created, and they'll blame us for it. I'm not sure what the right course of action is, to be honest.\n\nThis topic is really challenging for me because I don't know enough about it, and I'm not sure where to start. If you have any points you'd like me to focus on, I'd appreciate it.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war should be considered over, not just because of the lack of a formal declaration, but also because it's become more about showing our power and military might than achieving a genuine goal. It's like we're using force to prove a point, rather than working towards a solution.\n\nI'm torn, though. On one hand, I think we should help the Iraqis, but on the other, I worry about the resources we're wasting and the potential consequences of our actions. I feel sorry for President Bush, as this war is making him look really bad, much like the Vietnam War did. It's like history is repeating itself.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether I want the war to end or continue, because I think about all the families who have loved ones fighting in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. However, I also think that our presence is causing more harm than good, as we're disrupting their culture and creating more divisions among the different groups in Iraq. I worry that our attempts to impose our way of life on them will only lead to more resentment and hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, and it's hard to see a clear solution. That's about all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it a law or even recognize it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially considering the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a pretty straightforward principle that's been set in stone, and I think trying to impose any kind of authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established.\n\nTo me, allowing government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal is essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. It's clear that a lot of Catholics and Christians are against it, and it's mainly being opposed in certain areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what's acceptable or not within the church.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I think trying to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be wrong and contradict the existing values. It's one of the few amendments that would actually restrict the people rather than limiting government power, which is exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to do.\n\nPersonally, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I believe the president's push for an amendment is mainly driven by his own Catholic beliefs and personal views. It's showing a preference for one religion over others, which I don't think is fair. The churches should be the ones making these decisions, not the government. There's no clear reasoning behind this amendment other than personal opinions, and I don't see how it would benefit the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive impact by [REWRITE] (some words were missing from the original text, if you could provide them I can rewrite it accordingly)",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. I've been thinking, and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. They tried to link it to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not like they were directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, and that's a big part of why the invasion started in 2003. As someone who's generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, I was strongly opposed to this one.\n\nIt's kind of like the Vietnam War all over again - the government should have learned from past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in this war, which is incredibly sad. What they did was remove the Iraqi government, and I don't think the US government was ready for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They're trying to install democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but it's not that easy. It's a long and hard process, and the US government underestimated the challenges they'd face.\n\nNo matter how many Iraqis wanted the US to intervene, there are still tons of insurgents, and it's hard to defeat them when you're fighting the citizens of the country, not an actual army. I think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes before invading, but they weren't prepared for the aftermath. We're still there in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. It's a long process to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take care of their own country, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be a quick and easy success.\n\nWe shouldn't have gone to war in the first place, but if we were going to do it, we should have been more honest with ourselves and the American people about the risks and challenges involved. It's not like democracy is something that can be easily imposed on a country; it's a long and difficult process, as we learned in our own country's history. The US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do, but it's not.\n\nIt's a tough decision to make, especially when you think about all the American lives lost and the country's resources being spent. Once you're in, it's hard to leave, especially when you've taken away someone else's government and way of life. We should try to see it through, but at the same time, there's a limit to how much we can risk American lives for the sake of a free, democratic Iraq. If we're really committed to spreading democracy, why not do it in other countries too? The truth is, it's often about oil and control of resources. The whole thing about Iraq having WMDs was a big factor in the decision to go to war, but no WMDs were ever found, and we're not doing anything about North Korea, which we know has WMDs. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest enough in its decision-making.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not optimistic. It's not looking good.",
            "I'm thinking about gay marriage, and I've always been on board with the idea. To me, it comes down to personal preference, and with recent studies showing that it might be biological rather than a social construct, it just doesn't seem right to deny people the right because of something they can't control. I think it's inhumane to do so. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I don't think the government should have a say in it – it's a personal, household issue. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs, live their lives, and it's clear that their relationship is no different from anyone else's.\n\nIt's ridiculous that politicians, like Bush, think they can dictate what marriage means. I've read and heard from various sources that research suggests homosexuality might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which is something people are born with, not something they choose. It's not like growing up in a certain environment or with certain family dynamics determines someone's sexual orientation.\n\nThe thing is, if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it's all over the news. That's just not right. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's thrust into the public domain.",
            "Honestly, I don't know where to start with this.  When you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's completely public knowledge. You can't just put something out there without considering how others might react. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this kind of situation before. Once you post something, it's going to influence people's opinions about you. If you start talking about violence or sensitive topics, someone's bound to take it seriously. You can't just post that kind of thing online because it's seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll get their bulletin, and if someone's concerned enough to report it, the school has to act. They can't just ignore it, especially if there's a risk of something bad happening. On the other hand, it's hard to know what's real and what's just a joke, especially when people can be careless with their online posts. \n\nWhat happened here was that someone overheard something in school, reported it, and when we found out who the person was, they looked at their social media and found some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a different tone in light of the situation. When you post something online, there's no such thing as privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people think or what they take seriously. I don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media or snooping around their profiles, but if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's not, then it's a different story. I also don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, especially if they post about it online. That's not my place to know, and it's not something I'd want to deal with.",
            "To be honest, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Originally, the goal was to bring democracy to a nation that desperately needed it. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose and are now possibly fighting just to prove our military superiority.\n\nI have to wonder if the true motives behind the war were genuine from the start, considering George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If our initial goal was to bring democracy to a country with a flawed government system, then that would have been a justifiable reason. But if there were personal interests at play, I think that would have been unfair.\n\nIn my opinion, we made our point clear in the first few months of the war - it was a powerful statement. But continuing the conflict for over a year, even years, seems excessive. If our intention was to give people living under a tyrant a chance for freedom, that's a noble cause, and I think that's a good reason to go to war. However, I believe our reasons have been distorted and misinterpreted over time, and it seems like we're fighting just to say we're fighting.\n\nI genuinely think it's time to call an end to this war. The Iraqi government should take responsibility for its own affairs, and it's clear that time has come. We're spending billions of dollars on this conflict, money that could be better spent on our own problems, such as poverty, inadequate public services, and healthcare. It's staggering to think that we're allocating such a large portion of our budget to war efforts, which have lost their initial purpose.\n\nIn my opinion, war should not be a long-term investment. We have pressing issues on our own turf, such as crumbling infrastructure, underfunded schools, and healthcare. It's heartbreaking to see our citizens being killed in a foreign war that we've lost sight of its cause. I think that's the harsh reality we need to face.",
            "To clarify, something stopped happening because someone went online and saw a certain post.\nOkay, so you know how on Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much available to everyone who's connected to you?\nI mean, if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they can see your profile, and you've basically given them permission to do so by accepting them as a friend.\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, it's likely that a lot of people will see it.\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that post and was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from arising.\n\nHowever, this raises some tough questions. I mean, it's not feasible for just one person to be constantly monitoring everyone's online profiles to prevent problems. That would be a form of discrimination if they're only targeting certain individuals. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to sift through people's online profiles, unless they have a good reason to do so, like if they actually found something suspicious.\nIt's all about the context - were they just randomly looking through profiles or were they actively searching for something?\nI'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my information. I've seen a report on TV about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and even convince them to meet with him. It's scary to think about how easily people can access personal info and use it for malicious purposes. I've even had people from my classes IM me, despite not knowing my username, and it's hard to know who's really behind the screen. They can see my interests, my class schedule, my friends, and even photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends online. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've heard that some schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, but I'm not sure how they have the authority to do so. That seems like a privacy issue to me, but I'm not sure how they got the right to dictate what their students can and can't do online.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I'll go ahead and discuss my thoughts on the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical saying this, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's been made clear by now that this invasion was a bad idea, with most people, including the administration, acknowledging this in hindsight.\n\nRecent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and even 70% of US troops stationed in the country believe that the war was a poor decision. This suggests that a significant majority of people, both at home and abroad, think it was a mistake.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the very beginning, and pulling out now will also be challenging. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are vast, making it difficult for the US to impose its views and values on the region. The idea of forcing democracy on a culture that doesn't naturally adopt it is misguided.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam was a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The quicksand-like situation we've created in Iraq is a prime example of this. I don't see a compelling reason for the US to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.\n\nThe administration might have some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't seen a clear, legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually, over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't understand why we can't leave now.\n\nInterestingly, a significant majority of Iraqis – around 80% – think we should leave within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, yet they're telling us to leave. This suggests they might know better than us, and if we ask them to leave, we can say we respected their wishes, even if things don't go well after that.\n\nIf we decide to help them after leaving, at least we'll be seen as trying to make amends, even if we're not perfect. We can't change our past mistakes, but we can try to make things better in the future. It's not about being the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but about avoiding further catastrophe.",
            "I have to agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; I believe it also affects men in certain fields. You see, in many industries, people still struggle with finding equality, especially when it comes to working under a woman. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for a long time. \n\nFor example, women are often held back from promotions because of these stereotypes, despite having the qualifications for the job. It's also common for men to face judgment when they choose to be stay-at-home dads. People might think it's unusual for men to prioritize childcare, and it can be tough for them to break free from these expectations. I also think that men in the fashion industry often face prejudice if they're not 'typical' or don't fit the mold of what people expect. \n\nThe problem is that changing this mindset takes time, and it's slow progress. However, we've made significant strides, especially with more women taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs. As people become more accepting of these changes, it's becoming more common to see men staying home with their kids and women being the breadwinners. It's also helping to break down stereotypes in the fashion industry, where people are starting to take men in fashion seriously, regardless of their style or background.\n\nI guess the key is to promote understanding and acceptance without being too pushy or aggressive. If we force people to change their views too quickly, they'll resist. We're at a good point now where we're starting to see progress, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done. People are still discriminated against based on their background, education, and even their speech patterns, which can be just as limiting as gender bias. It's not just about promoting equality between genders; it's also about recognizing and addressing other forms of prejudice that exist in our society.",
            "Alright, so decriminalizing marijuana isn't the same as legalizing it; it just means that it's been reduced from a criminal offense to a more of a traffic ticket kind of thing. You get cited but not arrested. Now, when it comes to things like job interviews, that sort of thing, the ramifications might not be as bad as they would be with a full-fledged drug charge. But even though decriminalization takes away some of the harsher consequences, it doesn't eliminate them entirely. People still worry about how this will affect their future, and that's valid. On the other hand, arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana use can be really expensive - think about all the costs of bringing someone in, letting them go, and then going through the court process. Some cities might be hesitant to make that investment, even if it would free up some money for other important things.\n\nTake Denver, though, which is a pretty open-minded place. They've seen a financial boost since decriminalizing marijuana, which they can now use for education, social programs, and helping those in need. It's not just about the money, though - there are plenty of reasons why marijuana shouldn't be legal everywhere. For instance, it could lead to more smoking and driving, which is a big concern. Plus, marijuana is still generally seen as taboo in many societies, so having it out in the open could be uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nAs for the effects of marijuana and alcohol, it's hard to generalize because everyone reacts differently. Some people have a harder time with moderation, while others can handle it just fine. In terms of driving and decision-making skills, alcohol tends to have more of a negative impact, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, when it comes to substances, there's no one-size-fits-all answer because people respond differently.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to [the idea of allowing priests to be married] because a lot of the traditional practices within the Catholic Church have been around for a long time, and it's great to have a sense of tradition. However, it's also essential to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. One thing that's always concerned me is how strict the Church can be, not just with its rules but also in judging those who don't follow them perfectly. I'm talking about how they treat people from other faiths, like my parents, who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, but couldn't get married in the Church because of my father's background. This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, especially considering the Catholic teaching of loving others. It seems like the doctrine and practice don't always align, especially when it comes to outdated rules.\n\nWhile I think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, I'm not convinced that it would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior. People who engage in such acts tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a separate issue altogether, one that's not directly related to whether or not someone is married. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't magically fix the problem, and it's unlikely to make a difference in the long run.\n\nIt's true that some people might do whatever they want, regardless of their marital status. If someone has a tendency to harm children, they'll probably do so whether they're married or not. So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to this issue. It's not a simple fix, and it's not something that can be solved by a single change in the Church's rules.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this topic.  I haven't given it much thought yet, so I don't know if either side is right or wrong. This issue seems to be the most challenging one we're facing. It's tough to navigate the separation of church and state, especially when it comes to defining marriage, without offending anyone. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I think that civil unions might be the way to go. I'm not convinced that marriage should be regulated by the government, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament. If it were just a civil union, people wouldn't get special tax breaks or treatment just because they're married.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't care about the specifics of the marriage as long as it's between two consenting adults. It's not their place to interfere with the separation of church and state. If two people want to get a civil union, that's all that matters.\n\nI also think that making gay marriage a federal law would be a good idea if all states can come to a logical agreement. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems ridiculous. It's a big issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant altering the constitution.\n\nIt's just not that crucial to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. It's really not that important.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this either.",
            "I come from a Christian background, but to be honest, the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a complex issue for me. On one hand, I have close gay friends, so I've had a chance to understand their perspective. While I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do think it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter for the federal government to decide, but rather something that each state should determine on its own.\n\nI believe this is because different states have different values and opinions. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, while Republican states may not. If you live in a state that has decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think it's right to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to live there. I think everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have equal opportunities, which is why I believe it should be left up to each state to decide.\n\nI do disagree with President Bush's stance on banning gay marriage, and I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He can't make decisions for every state, and his ban is unlikely to be in place forever. A new president could come in and repeal it, so why not let each state decide for itself? They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of the decision, not the president. Ultimately, I think it's up to each state to make its own choice on this issue.",
            "Honestly, I'm not at all in agreement with this. Let me think for a moment. I suppose it's worth noting that Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're basically sharing it with the public. If you look at the definition of a bulletin, it's essentially a post intended for others to see. So, if you post something online, you have to be aware that it's going to be seen by others, including school officials, even if it's not under the school's name. They could still access it from their homes, after all. \n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring the internet to prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine that they're doing it. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. I mean, if they're looking through Myspace to catch students engaging in underage drinking or other prohibited activities, I do think that's an invasion of privacy. However, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nI think it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing, and it's true that Myspace is a public platform. If a student posts something on Myspace and then gets in trouble for it, that's not unusual. I'm careful about what I post online, like even in emails. I'm worried that something I say could come back to haunt me later.\n\nIf you post something as a college student, it's likely to follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever, and there's no taking it back. If you do something that gets you in trouble, you'll have to face the consequences. I don't think this is an invasion of privacy, because as I said before, Myspace is a public platform. What I'm saying is that I don't think school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's okay. When parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment, and that's what the school officials were trying to achieve in this case. They were just taking precautions to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nMy teacher discussed this with me at my public high school, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is safe. They did drills and lockdowns in case of a terrorist attack, and it's similar to what happened with the school shooting. They were just trying to make the school a safer place, and that's what the school officials were doing in this case – taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.",
            "Honestly, I've had time to reflect on our decision to go to war, and my perspective has shifted. To be frank, I was initially all for it because it was a deeply personal issue for me, especially after 9/11. I felt a strong desire to make a difference and cause chaos, just like they had done to us. However, I now think we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into it without a clear plan.\n\nI believe that the emotional toll of 9/11 clouded our judgment, and we went in unprepared. Unfortunately, this led to a disastrous outcome. I've come to realize that as long as the different factions over there are fighting each other, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't be there to try to fix their problems; instead, we should focus on our own security.\n\nTo be honest, I've lost interest in the conflict and those people. It's hard to care about their struggles when they can't even cooperate with each other. I think we went in there with a misguided sense of purpose, fueled by emotions rather than reason. We were looking for revenge, and President Bush seemed to be driven by public opinion and a desire to take action. However, I understand his perspective at the time.\n\nI don't think we had a choice but to respond to the situation, but I do think we could have done it differently. We should have had a clearer plan for creating order and a more unified effort. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case, and we ended up creating more chaos.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're capable of changing those people; they're stuck in their ways. We're just prolonging our own suffering by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify our continued involvement. In the end, it's only a matter of time before things fall apart, and we can't stay there forever. I genuinely believe we're doing more harm than good by remaining there."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Their views on certain issues might be causing them to lose followers. I think this is because the Church isn't very accepting of many things. For instance, when it comes to gay marriages, abortions, and birth control, the Church has very strong views, but they may be a bit outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, they'd likely worry less about losing their following.\n\nI've noticed that some people are starting to turn against the Church due to their stance on these issues. This is because people have different views on these subjects, and they feel that the Church is holding the wrong views. For example, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't agree with that.\n\nIt's interesting to think about why the Church is against things like female priests and priests being married. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe if priests were allowed to be married or if women could be priests, things would be different, but I'm not convinced it would have made a significant difference.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married, considering the Church views them as being married to God and devoted to their lives as priests. It's like any other job - people have their professional lives and their personal lives. The fact that priests can't have both seems outdated.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that I've given this a lot of thought, and I don't actually have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. It seems unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their sexual orientation. I mean, think about it - people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I'm straight and others are gay. It's not something they can switch or change at will. I don't think the government should be involved in this, as it's not a matter of security or morality - it's a personal issue that doesn't concern them. To me, it's just about treating people with respect and allowing them to live their lives as they are. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who can and can't get married based on their orientation. It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nIn fact, it's kind of simple - the government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives unless it affects the country's security or well-being. But this isn't about that. It's about two people loving each other and wanting to get married. I don't think the government should be in a position to deny them that. It's just common sense, you know? Let people be who they are and live their lives without the government breathing down their necks. It's really not that complicated.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I think it's wrong to deny gay people the right to get married. It's just basic human decency. They shouldn't be punished for being who they are, and the government shouldn't be involved in their personal lives. It's as simple as that.\n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it - I think the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not their call. People should be free to love who they want and get married to whoever they choose, without the government getting in the way.\n\nI'm not going to dwell on this anymore, but I just wanted to share my thoughts. I hope that makes sense.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct things that can't be equated. Each side of the coin is unique, and it's not fair to judge one over the other. The truth is, homosexual couples have the same rights as everyone else, like having their partner by their side in times of need, even in a hospital or when it comes to tax laws and healthcare benefits.\n\nIt's ridiculous that partners in a same-sex relationship can't be considered family in the eyes of the law. They're committed to each other, and that's what matters most. Scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples, which is a clear indication that love is love, regardless of orientation.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that homosexual couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church ceremony. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are no different from straight couples in many ways, like the roles they play in their relationships.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about adoption, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these are just new issues that we're still learning about. However, it's hard to deny the fact that children from gay parents are just as capable and deserving of love and respect as any other child. In fact, some schools in cities like New York City even have special programs for kids from gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nThe real issue is that the government should take a stand on this matter and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The current amendment opposing it is a clear example of hypocrisy, as it goes against the principles of equality and freedom that America claims to uphold. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" pledge shows that people are willing to challenge laws that enforce religious standards, so why not apply the same logic to gay marriage?\n\nOne of the main reasons people are against gay marriage is the misconception that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims, and it's time we listen to the experts rather than popular opinion or personal biases. If we did, we'd see the world in a different light and recognize the beauty of love in all its forms.",
            "Okay, let's get this straight. I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I want to make one thing clear: just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. I mean, think about it - there are plenty of prescription meds that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them all the time to help people, and that's exactly what I think we should be doing with marijuana.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is that different from other substances that are abused, like alcohol. Sure, abusing it can lead to problems, but so can abusing alcohol. It's a tough one, I'll admit it. But I think we should take a step back and look at the benefits of marijuana. If we could remove the stigma around it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes. It's not some evil substance like heroin or cocaine - it's got its own set of risks and benefits.\n\nIf we're going to make it available to the public, it shouldn't be all or nothing. A gradual approach might work better, but first, we need to change the way people think about marijuana. It's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, and if we can get past that, maybe we can use it to help people instead of shunning it. That's my two cents, anyway.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. I've noticed this change since I was a kid, going to church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little outfit and matching accessories. I went to a private school and church was a big part of my weekend routine, seeing my friends there was always a highlight. Now, they've introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, which is only 30 minutes long, and people dress in casual attire, especially during summer. It's become more laid-back, even at morning masses where I used to dress up, now people wear jeans and khakis. I think this shift is noticeable, it's the biggest change I've seen. As for other things, that's pretty much it, I don't really know the church's politics, but that's my take on it. \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these situations. There are men who are married and still become pedophiles, it's not about their marital status. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and there are other religions where they can be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I think pedophilia is rooted in genetics, people are born with these tendencies, and it's not something that can be hidden or changed through marriage. The church can't prevent something that's innate, and if they knew about it and covered it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they always knew. As for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have any.",
            "(laughs) \nAt first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we entered Iraq using it as a pretext, with various reasons leading us into the conflict. I believe the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and still hasn't taken responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave that pivotal speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power and an impeachable offense.\n\nI think the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. When I think back to that time, it's clear that the administration had it out for Saddam Hussein, partly due to a grudge carried over from his dad's administration, and also to expand our energy supply – which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI'm not sure how long this can go on, but I believe withdrawing now could be problematic, as there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in more deaths. The current alternative, where the UN and US are considering a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, doesn't seem like a great idea to me. This could create more long-term issues, particularly with Iraq's sovereignty, as it appears the interim government is disintegrating. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the situation.\n\nWith groups like Mugtada al-Sadr's party holding significant power in the Iraqi Parliament and radical elements vying for control, the political process is experiencing significant friction. I'm not sure I can articulate all the issues in polite conversation, but it's clear this is a complex and messy situation.",
            "I'm really struggling to find the right words on this. Okay, let's get the basics out of the way first. To be honest, I don't know much about the Iraq War. I mean, it wasn't officially declared as a war, which already makes it tricky to discuss. I think it started as a sort of revenge for 9/11, targeting the people we believed were responsible. But, to be frank, I don't follow this closely, and I'm not sure about all the details. As far as I understand, we're trying to build a democracy in Iraq, making it more like the US, and also securing oil resources. However, this approach is causing a lot of tension and distress.\n\nWe're stuck between a rock and a hard place. If we stay, we'll be tasked with building a democracy, which can't be done overnight, and it'll take a lot of time and effort. But, if we leave, the Iraqis will be left to deal with the mess we created, and they'll blame us for it. I'm not sure what the right course of action is, to be honest.\n\nThis topic is really challenging for me because I don't know enough about it, and I'm not sure where to start. If you have any points you'd like me to focus on, I'd appreciate it.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war should be considered over, not just because of the lack of a formal declaration, but also because it's become more about showing our power and military might than achieving a genuine goal. It's like we're using force to prove a point, rather than working towards a solution.\n\nI'm torn, though. On one hand, I think we should help the Iraqis, but on the other, I worry about the resources we're wasting and the potential consequences of our actions. I feel sorry for President Bush, as this war is making him look really bad, much like the Vietnam War did. It's like history is repeating itself.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether I want the war to end or continue, because I think about all the families who have loved ones fighting in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. However, I also think that our presence is causing more harm than good, as we're disrupting their culture and creating more divisions among the different groups in Iraq. I worry that our attempts to impose our way of life on them will only lead to more resentment and hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, and it's hard to see a clear solution. That's about all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it a law or even recognize it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially considering the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a pretty straightforward principle that's been set in stone, and I think trying to impose any kind of authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established.\n\nTo me, allowing government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal is essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. It's clear that a lot of Catholics and Christians are against it, and it's mainly being opposed in certain areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what's acceptable or not within the church.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I think trying to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be wrong and contradict the existing values. It's one of the few amendments that would actually restrict the people rather than limiting government power, which is exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to do.\n\nPersonally, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I believe the president's push for an amendment is mainly driven by his own Catholic beliefs and personal views. It's showing a preference for one religion over others, which I don't think is fair. The churches should be the ones making these decisions, not the government. There's no clear reasoning behind this amendment other than personal opinions, and I don't see how it would benefit the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive impact by [REWRITE] (some words were missing from the original text, if you could provide them I can rewrite it accordingly)",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. I've been thinking, and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. They tried to link it to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not like they were directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, and that's a big part of why the invasion started in 2003. As someone who's generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, I was strongly opposed to this one.\n\nIt's kind of like the Vietnam War all over again - the government should have learned from past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in this war, which is incredibly sad. What they did was remove the Iraqi government, and I don't think the US government was ready for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They're trying to install democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but it's not that easy. It's a long and hard process, and the US government underestimated the challenges they'd face.\n\nNo matter how many Iraqis wanted the US to intervene, there are still tons of insurgents, and it's hard to defeat them when you're fighting the citizens of the country, not an actual army. I think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes before invading, but they weren't prepared for the aftermath. We're still there in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. It's a long process to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take care of their own country, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be a quick and easy success.\n\nWe shouldn't have gone to war in the first place, but if we were going to do it, we should have been more honest with ourselves and the American people about the risks and challenges involved. It's not like democracy is something that can be easily imposed on a country; it's a long and difficult process, as we learned in our own country's history. The US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do, but it's not.\n\nIt's a tough decision to make, especially when you think about all the American lives lost and the country's resources being spent. Once you're in, it's hard to leave, especially when you've taken away someone else's government and way of life. We should try to see it through, but at the same time, there's a limit to how much we can risk American lives for the sake of a free, democratic Iraq. If we're really committed to spreading democracy, why not do it in other countries too? The truth is, it's often about oil and control of resources. The whole thing about Iraq having WMDs was a big factor in the decision to go to war, but no WMDs were ever found, and we're not doing anything about North Korea, which we know has WMDs. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest enough in its decision-making.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not optimistic. It's not looking good.",
            "I'm thinking about gay marriage, and I've always been on board with the idea. To me, it comes down to personal preference, and with recent studies showing that it might be biological rather than a social construct, it just doesn't seem right to deny people the right because of something they can't control. I think it's inhumane to do so. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I don't think the government should have a say in it – it's a personal, household issue. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs, live their lives, and it's clear that their relationship is no different from anyone else's.\n\nIt's ridiculous that politicians, like Bush, think they can dictate what marriage means. I've read and heard from various sources that research suggests homosexuality might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which is something people are born with, not something they choose. It's not like growing up in a certain environment or with certain family dynamics determines someone's sexual orientation.\n\nThe thing is, if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it's all over the news. That's just not right. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's thrust into the public domain.",
            "Honestly, I don't know where to start with this.  When you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's completely public knowledge. You can't just put something out there without considering how others might react. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this kind of situation before. Once you post something, it's going to influence people's opinions about you. If you start talking about violence or sensitive topics, someone's bound to take it seriously. You can't just post that kind of thing online because it's seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll get their bulletin, and if someone's concerned enough to report it, the school has to act. They can't just ignore it, especially if there's a risk of something bad happening. On the other hand, it's hard to know what's real and what's just a joke, especially when people can be careless with their online posts. \n\nWhat happened here was that someone overheard something in school, reported it, and when we found out who the person was, they looked at their social media and found some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a different tone in light of the situation. When you post something online, there's no such thing as privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people think or what they take seriously. I don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media or snooping around their profiles, but if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's not, then it's a different story. I also don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, especially if they post about it online. That's not my place to know, and it's not something I'd want to deal with.",
            "To be honest, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Originally, the goal was to bring democracy to a nation that desperately needed it. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose and are now possibly fighting just to prove our military superiority.\n\nI have to wonder if the true motives behind the war were genuine from the start, considering George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If our initial goal was to bring democracy to a country with a flawed government system, then that would have been a justifiable reason. But if there were personal interests at play, I think that would have been unfair.\n\nIn my opinion, we made our point clear in the first few months of the war - it was a powerful statement. But continuing the conflict for over a year, even years, seems excessive. If our intention was to give people living under a tyrant a chance for freedom, that's a noble cause, and I think that's a good reason to go to war. However, I believe our reasons have been distorted and misinterpreted over time, and it seems like we're fighting just to say we're fighting.\n\nI genuinely think it's time to call an end to this war. The Iraqi government should take responsibility for its own affairs, and it's clear that time has come. We're spending billions of dollars on this conflict, money that could be better spent on our own problems, such as poverty, inadequate public services, and healthcare. It's staggering to think that we're allocating such a large portion of our budget to war efforts, which have lost their initial purpose.\n\nIn my opinion, war should not be a long-term investment. We have pressing issues on our own turf, such as crumbling infrastructure, underfunded schools, and healthcare. It's heartbreaking to see our citizens being killed in a foreign war that we've lost sight of its cause. I think that's the harsh reality we need to face.",
            "To clarify, something stopped happening because someone went online and saw a certain post.\nOkay, so you know how on Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much available to everyone who's connected to you?\nI mean, if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they can see your profile, and you've basically given them permission to do so by accepting them as a friend.\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, it's likely that a lot of people will see it.\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that post and was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from arising.\n\nHowever, this raises some tough questions. I mean, it's not feasible for just one person to be constantly monitoring everyone's online profiles to prevent problems. That would be a form of discrimination if they're only targeting certain individuals. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to sift through people's online profiles, unless they have a good reason to do so, like if they actually found something suspicious.\nIt's all about the context - were they just randomly looking through profiles or were they actively searching for something?\nI'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my information. I've seen a report on TV about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and even convince them to meet with him. It's scary to think about how easily people can access personal info and use it for malicious purposes. I've even had people from my classes IM me, despite not knowing my username, and it's hard to know who's really behind the screen. They can see my interests, my class schedule, my friends, and even photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends online. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've heard that some schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, but I'm not sure how they have the authority to do so. That seems like a privacy issue to me, but I'm not sure how they got the right to dictate what their students can and can't do online.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I'll go ahead and discuss my thoughts on the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical saying this, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's been made clear by now that this invasion was a bad idea, with most people, including the administration, acknowledging this in hindsight.\n\nRecent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and even 70% of US troops stationed in the country believe that the war was a poor decision. This suggests that a significant majority of people, both at home and abroad, think it was a mistake.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the very beginning, and pulling out now will also be challenging. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are vast, making it difficult for the US to impose its views and values on the region. The idea of forcing democracy on a culture that doesn't naturally adopt it is misguided.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam was a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The quicksand-like situation we've created in Iraq is a prime example of this. I don't see a compelling reason for the US to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.\n\nThe administration might have some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't seen a clear, legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually, over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't understand why we can't leave now.\n\nInterestingly, a significant majority of Iraqis – around 80% – think we should leave within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, yet they're telling us to leave. This suggests they might know better than us, and if we ask them to leave, we can say we respected their wishes, even if things don't go well after that.\n\nIf we decide to help them after leaving, at least we'll be seen as trying to make amends, even if we're not perfect. We can't change our past mistakes, but we can try to make things better in the future. It's not about being the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but about avoiding further catastrophe.",
            "I have to agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; I believe it also affects men in certain fields. You see, in many industries, people still struggle with finding equality, especially when it comes to working under a woman. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for a long time. \n\nFor example, women are often held back from promotions because of these stereotypes, despite having the qualifications for the job. It's also common for men to face judgment when they choose to be stay-at-home dads. People might think it's unusual for men to prioritize childcare, and it can be tough for them to break free from these expectations. I also think that men in the fashion industry often face prejudice if they're not 'typical' or don't fit the mold of what people expect. \n\nThe problem is that changing this mindset takes time, and it's slow progress. However, we've made significant strides, especially with more women taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs. As people become more accepting of these changes, it's becoming more common to see men staying home with their kids and women being the breadwinners. It's also helping to break down stereotypes in the fashion industry, where people are starting to take men in fashion seriously, regardless of their style or background.\n\nI guess the key is to promote understanding and acceptance without being too pushy or aggressive. If we force people to change their views too quickly, they'll resist. We're at a good point now where we're starting to see progress, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done. People are still discriminated against based on their background, education, and even their speech patterns, which can be just as limiting as gender bias. It's not just about promoting equality between genders; it's also about recognizing and addressing other forms of prejudice that exist in our society.",
            "Alright, so decriminalizing marijuana isn't the same as legalizing it; it just means that it's been reduced from a criminal offense to a more of a traffic ticket kind of thing. You get cited but not arrested. Now, when it comes to things like job interviews, that sort of thing, the ramifications might not be as bad as they would be with a full-fledged drug charge. But even though decriminalization takes away some of the harsher consequences, it doesn't eliminate them entirely. People still worry about how this will affect their future, and that's valid. On the other hand, arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana use can be really expensive - think about all the costs of bringing someone in, letting them go, and then going through the court process. Some cities might be hesitant to make that investment, even if it would free up some money for other important things.\n\nTake Denver, though, which is a pretty open-minded place. They've seen a financial boost since decriminalizing marijuana, which they can now use for education, social programs, and helping those in need. It's not just about the money, though - there are plenty of reasons why marijuana shouldn't be legal everywhere. For instance, it could lead to more smoking and driving, which is a big concern. Plus, marijuana is still generally seen as taboo in many societies, so having it out in the open could be uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nAs for the effects of marijuana and alcohol, it's hard to generalize because everyone reacts differently. Some people have a harder time with moderation, while others can handle it just fine. In terms of driving and decision-making skills, alcohol tends to have more of a negative impact, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, when it comes to substances, there's no one-size-fits-all answer because people respond differently.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to [the idea of allowing priests to be married] because a lot of the traditional practices within the Catholic Church have been around for a long time, and it's great to have a sense of tradition. However, it's also essential to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. One thing that's always concerned me is how strict the Church can be, not just with its rules but also in judging those who don't follow them perfectly. I'm talking about how they treat people from other faiths, like my parents, who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, but couldn't get married in the Church because of my father's background. This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, especially considering the Catholic teaching of loving others. It seems like the doctrine and practice don't always align, especially when it comes to outdated rules.\n\nWhile I think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, I'm not convinced that it would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior. People who engage in such acts tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a separate issue altogether, one that's not directly related to whether or not someone is married. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't magically fix the problem, and it's unlikely to make a difference in the long run.\n\nIt's true that some people might do whatever they want, regardless of their marital status. If someone has a tendency to harm children, they'll probably do so whether they're married or not. So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to this issue. It's not a simple fix, and it's not something that can be solved by a single change in the Church's rules.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this topic.  I haven't given it much thought yet, so I don't know if either side is right or wrong. This issue seems to be the most challenging one we're facing. It's tough to navigate the separation of church and state, especially when it comes to defining marriage, without offending anyone. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I think that civil unions might be the way to go. I'm not convinced that marriage should be regulated by the government, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament. If it were just a civil union, people wouldn't get special tax breaks or treatment just because they're married.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't care about the specifics of the marriage as long as it's between two consenting adults. It's not their place to interfere with the separation of church and state. If two people want to get a civil union, that's all that matters.\n\nI also think that making gay marriage a federal law would be a good idea if all states can come to a logical agreement. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems ridiculous. It's a big issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant altering the constitution.\n\nIt's just not that crucial to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. It's really not that important.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this either.",
            "I come from a Christian background, but to be honest, the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a complex issue for me. On one hand, I have close gay friends, so I've had a chance to understand their perspective. While I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do think it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter for the federal government to decide, but rather something that each state should determine on its own.\n\nI believe this is because different states have different values and opinions. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, while Republican states may not. If you live in a state that has decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think it's right to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to live there. I think everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have equal opportunities, which is why I believe it should be left up to each state to decide.\n\nI do disagree with President Bush's stance on banning gay marriage, and I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He can't make decisions for every state, and his ban is unlikely to be in place forever. A new president could come in and repeal it, so why not let each state decide for itself? They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of the decision, not the president. Ultimately, I think it's up to each state to make its own choice on this issue.",
            "Honestly, I'm not at all in agreement with this. Let me think for a moment. I suppose it's worth noting that Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're basically sharing it with the public. If you look at the definition of a bulletin, it's essentially a post intended for others to see. So, if you post something online, you have to be aware that it's going to be seen by others, including school officials, even if it's not under the school's name. They could still access it from their homes, after all. \n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring the internet to prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine that they're doing it. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. I mean, if they're looking through Myspace to catch students engaging in underage drinking or other prohibited activities, I do think that's an invasion of privacy. However, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nI think it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing, and it's true that Myspace is a public platform. If a student posts something on Myspace and then gets in trouble for it, that's not unusual. I'm careful about what I post online, like even in emails. I'm worried that something I say could come back to haunt me later.\n\nIf you post something as a college student, it's likely to follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever, and there's no taking it back. If you do something that gets you in trouble, you'll have to face the consequences. I don't think this is an invasion of privacy, because as I said before, Myspace is a public platform. What I'm saying is that I don't think school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's okay. When parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment, and that's what the school officials were trying to achieve in this case. They were just taking precautions to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nMy teacher discussed this with me at my public high school, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is safe. They did drills and lockdowns in case of a terrorist attack, and it's similar to what happened with the school shooting. They were just trying to make the school a safer place, and that's what the school officials were doing in this case – taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.",
            "Honestly, I've had time to reflect on our decision to go to war, and my perspective has shifted. To be frank, I was initially all for it because it was a deeply personal issue for me, especially after 9/11. I felt a strong desire to make a difference and cause chaos, just like they had done to us. However, I now think we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into it without a clear plan.\n\nI believe that the emotional toll of 9/11 clouded our judgment, and we went in unprepared. Unfortunately, this led to a disastrous outcome. I've come to realize that as long as the different factions over there are fighting each other, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't be there to try to fix their problems; instead, we should focus on our own security.\n\nTo be honest, I've lost interest in the conflict and those people. It's hard to care about their struggles when they can't even cooperate with each other. I think we went in there with a misguided sense of purpose, fueled by emotions rather than reason. We were looking for revenge, and President Bush seemed to be driven by public opinion and a desire to take action. However, I understand his perspective at the time.\n\nI don't think we had a choice but to respond to the situation, but I do think we could have done it differently. We should have had a clearer plan for creating order and a more unified effort. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case, and we ended up creating more chaos.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're capable of changing those people; they're stuck in their ways. We're just prolonging our own suffering by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify our continued involvement. In the end, it's only a matter of time before things fall apart, and we can't stay there forever. I genuinely believe we're doing more harm than good by remaining there."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Their views on certain issues might be causing them to lose followers. I think this is because the Church isn't very accepting of many things. For instance, when it comes to gay marriages, abortions, and birth control, the Church has very strong views, but they may be a bit outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, they'd likely worry less about losing their following.\n\nI've noticed that some people are starting to turn against the Church due to their stance on these issues. This is because people have different views on these subjects, and they feel that the Church is holding the wrong views. For example, if someone supports abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't agree with that.\n\nIt's interesting to think about why the Church is against things like female priests and priests being married. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe if priests were allowed to be married or if women could be priests, things would be different, but I'm not convinced it would have made a significant difference.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married, considering the Church views them as being married to God and devoted to their lives as priests. It's like any other job - people have their professional lives and their personal lives. The fact that priests can't have both seems outdated.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that I've given this a lot of thought, and I don't actually have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. It seems unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their sexual orientation. I mean, think about it - people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I'm straight and others are gay. It's not something they can switch or change at will. I don't think the government should be involved in this, as it's not a matter of security or morality - it's a personal issue that doesn't concern them. To me, it's just about treating people with respect and allowing them to live their lives as they are. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who can and can't get married based on their orientation. It just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nIn fact, it's kind of simple - the government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives unless it affects the country's security or well-being. But this isn't about that. It's about two people loving each other and wanting to get married. I don't think the government should be in a position to deny them that. It's just common sense, you know? Let people be who they are and live their lives without the government breathing down their necks. It's really not that complicated.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I think it's wrong to deny gay people the right to get married. It's just basic human decency. They shouldn't be punished for being who they are, and the government shouldn't be involved in their personal lives. It's as simple as that.\n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it - I think the government is overstepping its bounds by trying to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not their call. People should be free to love who they want and get married to whoever they choose, without the government getting in the way.\n\nI'm not going to dwell on this anymore, but I just wanted to share my thoughts. I hope that makes sense.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct things that can't be equated. Each side of the coin is unique, and it's not fair to judge one over the other. The truth is, homosexual couples have the same rights as everyone else, like having their partner by their side in times of need, even in a hospital or when it comes to tax laws and healthcare benefits.\n\nIt's ridiculous that partners in a same-sex relationship can't be considered family in the eyes of the law. They're committed to each other, and that's what matters most. Scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples, which is a clear indication that love is love, regardless of orientation.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that homosexual couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church ceremony. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are no different from straight couples in many ways, like the roles they play in their relationships.\n\nOf course, there are concerns about adoption, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these are just new issues that we're still learning about. However, it's hard to deny the fact that children from gay parents are just as capable and deserving of love and respect as any other child. In fact, some schools in cities like New York City even have special programs for kids from gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nThe real issue is that the government should take a stand on this matter and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The current amendment opposing it is a clear example of hypocrisy, as it goes against the principles of equality and freedom that America claims to uphold. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" pledge shows that people are willing to challenge laws that enforce religious standards, so why not apply the same logic to gay marriage?\n\nOne of the main reasons people are against gay marriage is the misconception that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims, and it's time we listen to the experts rather than popular opinion or personal biases. If we did, we'd see the world in a different light and recognize the beauty of love in all its forms.",
            "Okay, let's get this straight. I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I want to make one thing clear: just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. I mean, think about it - there are plenty of prescription meds that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them all the time to help people, and that's exactly what I think we should be doing with marijuana.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is that different from other substances that are abused, like alcohol. Sure, abusing it can lead to problems, but so can abusing alcohol. It's a tough one, I'll admit it. But I think we should take a step back and look at the benefits of marijuana. If we could remove the stigma around it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes. It's not some evil substance like heroin or cocaine - it's got its own set of risks and benefits.\n\nIf we're going to make it available to the public, it shouldn't be all or nothing. A gradual approach might work better, but first, we need to change the way people think about marijuana. It's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, and if we can get past that, maybe we can use it to help people instead of shunning it. That's my two cents, anyway.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. I've noticed this change since I was a kid, going to church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little outfit and matching accessories. I went to a private school and church was a big part of my weekend routine, seeing my friends there was always a highlight. Now, they've introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, which is only 30 minutes long, and people dress in casual attire, especially during summer. It's become more laid-back, even at morning masses where I used to dress up, now people wear jeans and khakis. I think this shift is noticeable, it's the biggest change I've seen. As for other things, that's pretty much it, I don't really know the church's politics, but that's my take on it. \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these situations. There are men who are married and still become pedophiles, it's not about their marital status. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and there are other religions where they can be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I think pedophilia is rooted in genetics, people are born with these tendencies, and it's not something that can be hidden or changed through marriage. The church can't prevent something that's innate, and if they knew about it and covered it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they always knew. As for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have any.",
            "(laughs) \nAt first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we entered Iraq using it as a pretext, with various reasons leading us into the conflict. I believe the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and still hasn't taken responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave that pivotal speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious abuse of power and an impeachable offense.\n\nI think the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. When I think back to that time, it's clear that the administration had it out for Saddam Hussein, partly due to a grudge carried over from his dad's administration, and also to expand our energy supply – which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI'm not sure how long this can go on, but I believe withdrawing now could be problematic, as there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in more deaths. The current alternative, where the UN and US are considering a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, doesn't seem like a great idea to me. This could create more long-term issues, particularly with Iraq's sovereignty, as it appears the interim government is disintegrating. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the situation.\n\nWith groups like Mugtada al-Sadr's party holding significant power in the Iraqi Parliament and radical elements vying for control, the political process is experiencing significant friction. I'm not sure I can articulate all the issues in polite conversation, but it's clear this is a complex and messy situation.",
            "I'm really struggling to find the right words on this. Okay, let's get the basics out of the way first. To be honest, I don't know much about the Iraq War. I mean, it wasn't officially declared as a war, which already makes it tricky to discuss. I think it started as a sort of revenge for 9/11, targeting the people we believed were responsible. But, to be frank, I don't follow this closely, and I'm not sure about all the details. As far as I understand, we're trying to build a democracy in Iraq, making it more like the US, and also securing oil resources. However, this approach is causing a lot of tension and distress.\n\nWe're stuck between a rock and a hard place. If we stay, we'll be tasked with building a democracy, which can't be done overnight, and it'll take a lot of time and effort. But, if we leave, the Iraqis will be left to deal with the mess we created, and they'll blame us for it. I'm not sure what the right course of action is, to be honest.\n\nThis topic is really challenging for me because I don't know enough about it, and I'm not sure where to start. If you have any points you'd like me to focus on, I'd appreciate it.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war should be considered over, not just because of the lack of a formal declaration, but also because it's become more about showing our power and military might than achieving a genuine goal. It's like we're using force to prove a point, rather than working towards a solution.\n\nI'm torn, though. On one hand, I think we should help the Iraqis, but on the other, I worry about the resources we're wasting and the potential consequences of our actions. I feel sorry for President Bush, as this war is making him look really bad, much like the Vietnam War did. It's like history is repeating itself.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether I want the war to end or continue, because I think about all the families who have loved ones fighting in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. However, I also think that our presence is causing more harm than good, as we're disrupting their culture and creating more divisions among the different groups in Iraq. I worry that our attempts to impose our way of life on them will only lead to more resentment and hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, and it's hard to see a clear solution. That's about all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it a law or even recognize it as legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially considering the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's a pretty straightforward principle that's been set in stone, and I think trying to impose any kind of authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established.\n\nTo me, allowing government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal is essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. It's clear that a lot of Catholics and Christians are against it, and it's mainly being opposed in certain areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what's acceptable or not within the church.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I think trying to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be wrong and contradict the existing values. It's one of the few amendments that would actually restrict the people rather than limiting government power, which is exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to do.\n\nPersonally, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I believe the president's push for an amendment is mainly driven by his own Catholic beliefs and personal views. It's showing a preference for one religion over others, which I don't think is fair. The churches should be the ones making these decisions, not the government. There's no clear reasoning behind this amendment other than personal opinions, and I don't see how it would benefit the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive impact by [REWRITE] (some words were missing from the original text, if you could provide them I can rewrite it accordingly)",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. I've been thinking, and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. They tried to link it to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not like they were directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, and that's a big part of why the invasion started in 2003. As someone who's generally against war, especially preemptive strikes, I was strongly opposed to this one.\n\nIt's kind of like the Vietnam War all over again - the government should have learned from past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in this war, which is incredibly sad. What they did was remove the Iraqi government, and I don't think the US government was ready for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They're trying to install democracy, just like they did in Vietnam, but it's not that easy. It's a long and hard process, and the US government underestimated the challenges they'd face.\n\nNo matter how many Iraqis wanted the US to intervene, there are still tons of insurgents, and it's hard to defeat them when you're fighting the citizens of the country, not an actual army. I think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes before invading, but they weren't prepared for the aftermath. We're still there in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. It's a long process to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take care of their own country, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be a quick and easy success.\n\nWe shouldn't have gone to war in the first place, but if we were going to do it, we should have been more honest with ourselves and the American people about the risks and challenges involved. It's not like democracy is something that can be easily imposed on a country; it's a long and difficult process, as we learned in our own country's history. The US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do, but it's not.\n\nIt's a tough decision to make, especially when you think about all the American lives lost and the country's resources being spent. Once you're in, it's hard to leave, especially when you've taken away someone else's government and way of life. We should try to see it through, but at the same time, there's a limit to how much we can risk American lives for the sake of a free, democratic Iraq. If we're really committed to spreading democracy, why not do it in other countries too? The truth is, it's often about oil and control of resources. The whole thing about Iraq having WMDs was a big factor in the decision to go to war, but no WMDs were ever found, and we're not doing anything about North Korea, which we know has WMDs. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest enough in its decision-making.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not optimistic. It's not looking good.",
            "I'm thinking about gay marriage, and I've always been on board with the idea. To me, it comes down to personal preference, and with recent studies showing that it might be biological rather than a social construct, it just doesn't seem right to deny people the right because of something they can't control. I think it's inhumane to do so. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I don't think the government should have a say in it – it's a personal, household issue. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living just like any other family. They walk their dogs, live their lives, and it's clear that their relationship is no different from anyone else's.\n\nIt's ridiculous that politicians, like Bush, think they can dictate what marriage means. I've read and heard from various sources that research suggests homosexuality might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which is something people are born with, not something they choose. It's not like growing up in a certain environment or with certain family dynamics determines someone's sexual orientation.\n\nThe thing is, if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it's all over the news. That's just not right. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's thrust into the public domain.",
            "Honestly, I don't know where to start with this.  When you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's completely public knowledge. You can't just put something out there without considering how others might react. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this kind of situation before. Once you post something, it's going to influence people's opinions about you. If you start talking about violence or sensitive topics, someone's bound to take it seriously. You can't just post that kind of thing online because it's seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll get their bulletin, and if someone's concerned enough to report it, the school has to act. They can't just ignore it, especially if there's a risk of something bad happening. On the other hand, it's hard to know what's real and what's just a joke, especially when people can be careless with their online posts. \n\nWhat happened here was that someone overheard something in school, reported it, and when we found out who the person was, they looked at their social media and found some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a different tone in light of the situation. When you post something online, there's no such thing as privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control how people think or what they take seriously. I don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media or snooping around their profiles, but if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's not, then it's a different story. I also don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, especially if they post about it online. That's not my place to know, and it's not something I'd want to deal with.",
            "To be honest, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Originally, the goal was to bring democracy to a nation that desperately needed it. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose and are now possibly fighting just to prove our military superiority.\n\nI have to wonder if the true motives behind the war were genuine from the start, considering George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If our initial goal was to bring democracy to a country with a flawed government system, then that would have been a justifiable reason. But if there were personal interests at play, I think that would have been unfair.\n\nIn my opinion, we made our point clear in the first few months of the war - it was a powerful statement. But continuing the conflict for over a year, even years, seems excessive. If our intention was to give people living under a tyrant a chance for freedom, that's a noble cause, and I think that's a good reason to go to war. However, I believe our reasons have been distorted and misinterpreted over time, and it seems like we're fighting just to say we're fighting.\n\nI genuinely think it's time to call an end to this war. The Iraqi government should take responsibility for its own affairs, and it's clear that time has come. We're spending billions of dollars on this conflict, money that could be better spent on our own problems, such as poverty, inadequate public services, and healthcare. It's staggering to think that we're allocating such a large portion of our budget to war efforts, which have lost their initial purpose.\n\nIn my opinion, war should not be a long-term investment. We have pressing issues on our own turf, such as crumbling infrastructure, underfunded schools, and healthcare. It's heartbreaking to see our citizens being killed in a foreign war that we've lost sight of its cause. I think that's the harsh reality we need to face.",
            "To clarify, something stopped happening because someone went online and saw a certain post.\nOkay, so you know how on Myspace, if you post something, it's pretty much available to everyone who's connected to you?\nI mean, if you're friends with someone on Myspace, they can see your profile, and you've basically given them permission to do so by accepting them as a friend.\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, it's likely that a lot of people will see it.\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that post and was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from arising.\n\nHowever, this raises some tough questions. I mean, it's not feasible for just one person to be constantly monitoring everyone's online profiles to prevent problems. That would be a form of discrimination if they're only targeting certain individuals. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to sift through people's online profiles, unless they have a good reason to do so, like if they actually found something suspicious.\nIt's all about the context - were they just randomly looking through profiles or were they actively searching for something?\nI'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my information. I've seen a report on TV about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and even convince them to meet with him. It's scary to think about how easily people can access personal info and use it for malicious purposes. I've even had people from my classes IM me, despite not knowing my username, and it's hard to know who's really behind the screen. They can see my interests, my class schedule, my friends, and even photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends online. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've heard that some schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, but I'm not sure how they have the authority to do so. That seems like a privacy issue to me, but I'm not sure how they got the right to dictate what their students can and can't do online.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I'll go ahead and discuss my thoughts on the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical saying this, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's been made clear by now that this invasion was a bad idea, with most people, including the administration, acknowledging this in hindsight.\n\nRecent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and even 70% of US troops stationed in the country believe that the war was a poor decision. This suggests that a significant majority of people, both at home and abroad, think it was a mistake.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the very beginning, and pulling out now will also be challenging. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are vast, making it difficult for the US to impose its views and values on the region. The idea of forcing democracy on a culture that doesn't naturally adopt it is misguided.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam was a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The quicksand-like situation we've created in Iraq is a prime example of this. I don't see a compelling reason for the US to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.\n\nThe administration might have some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't seen a clear, legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually, over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't understand why we can't leave now.\n\nInterestingly, a significant majority of Iraqis – around 80% – think we should leave within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, yet they're telling us to leave. This suggests they might know better than us, and if we ask them to leave, we can say we respected their wishes, even if things don't go well after that.\n\nIf we decide to help them after leaving, at least we'll be seen as trying to make amends, even if we're not perfect. We can't change our past mistakes, but we can try to make things better in the future. It's not about being the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but about avoiding further catastrophe.",
            "I have to agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; I believe it also affects men in certain fields. You see, in many industries, people still struggle with finding equality, especially when it comes to working under a woman. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for a long time. \n\nFor example, women are often held back from promotions because of these stereotypes, despite having the qualifications for the job. It's also common for men to face judgment when they choose to be stay-at-home dads. People might think it's unusual for men to prioritize childcare, and it can be tough for them to break free from these expectations. I also think that men in the fashion industry often face prejudice if they're not 'typical' or don't fit the mold of what people expect. \n\nThe problem is that changing this mindset takes time, and it's slow progress. However, we've made significant strides, especially with more women taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs. As people become more accepting of these changes, it's becoming more common to see men staying home with their kids and women being the breadwinners. It's also helping to break down stereotypes in the fashion industry, where people are starting to take men in fashion seriously, regardless of their style or background.\n\nI guess the key is to promote understanding and acceptance without being too pushy or aggressive. If we force people to change their views too quickly, they'll resist. We're at a good point now where we're starting to see progress, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done. People are still discriminated against based on their background, education, and even their speech patterns, which can be just as limiting as gender bias. It's not just about promoting equality between genders; it's also about recognizing and addressing other forms of prejudice that exist in our society.",
            "Alright, so decriminalizing marijuana isn't the same as legalizing it; it just means that it's been reduced from a criminal offense to a more of a traffic ticket kind of thing. You get cited but not arrested. Now, when it comes to things like job interviews, that sort of thing, the ramifications might not be as bad as they would be with a full-fledged drug charge. But even though decriminalization takes away some of the harsher consequences, it doesn't eliminate them entirely. People still worry about how this will affect their future, and that's valid. On the other hand, arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana use can be really expensive - think about all the costs of bringing someone in, letting them go, and then going through the court process. Some cities might be hesitant to make that investment, even if it would free up some money for other important things.\n\nTake Denver, though, which is a pretty open-minded place. They've seen a financial boost since decriminalizing marijuana, which they can now use for education, social programs, and helping those in need. It's not just about the money, though - there are plenty of reasons why marijuana shouldn't be legal everywhere. For instance, it could lead to more smoking and driving, which is a big concern. Plus, marijuana is still generally seen as taboo in many societies, so having it out in the open could be uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nAs for the effects of marijuana and alcohol, it's hard to generalize because everyone reacts differently. Some people have a harder time with moderation, while others can handle it just fine. In terms of driving and decision-making skills, alcohol tends to have more of a negative impact, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, when it comes to substances, there's no one-size-fits-all answer because people respond differently.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to [the idea of allowing priests to be married] because a lot of the traditional practices within the Catholic Church have been around for a long time, and it's great to have a sense of tradition. However, it's also essential to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. One thing that's always concerned me is how strict the Church can be, not just with its rules but also in judging those who don't follow them perfectly. I'm talking about how they treat people from other faiths, like my parents, who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, but couldn't get married in the Church because of my father's background. This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, especially considering the Catholic teaching of loving others. It seems like the doctrine and practice don't always align, especially when it comes to outdated rules.\n\nWhile I think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, I'm not convinced that it would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior. People who engage in such acts tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a separate issue altogether, one that's not directly related to whether or not someone is married. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't magically fix the problem, and it's unlikely to make a difference in the long run.\n\nIt's true that some people might do whatever they want, regardless of their marital status. If someone has a tendency to harm children, they'll probably do so whether they're married or not. So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to this issue. It's not a simple fix, and it's not something that can be solved by a single change in the Church's rules.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this topic.  I haven't given it much thought yet, so I don't know if either side is right or wrong. This issue seems to be the most challenging one we're facing. It's tough to navigate the separation of church and state, especially when it comes to defining marriage, without offending anyone. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I think that civil unions might be the way to go. I'm not convinced that marriage should be regulated by the government, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament. If it were just a civil union, people wouldn't get special tax breaks or treatment just because they're married.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't care about the specifics of the marriage as long as it's between two consenting adults. It's not their place to interfere with the separation of church and state. If two people want to get a civil union, that's all that matters.\n\nI also think that making gay marriage a federal law would be a good idea if all states can come to a logical agreement. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems ridiculous. It's a big issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant altering the constitution.\n\nIt's just not that crucial to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. It's really not that important.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this either.",
            "I come from a Christian background, but to be honest, the topic of homosexuality is a bit of a complex issue for me. On one hand, I have close gay friends, so I've had a chance to understand their perspective. While I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I do think it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter for the federal government to decide, but rather something that each state should determine on its own.\n\nI believe this is because different states have different values and opinions. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, while Republican states may not. If you live in a state that has decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think it's right to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to live there. I think everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have equal opportunities, which is why I believe it should be left up to each state to decide.\n\nI do disagree with President Bush's stance on banning gay marriage, and I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He can't make decisions for every state, and his ban is unlikely to be in place forever. A new president could come in and repeal it, so why not let each state decide for itself? They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of the decision, not the president. Ultimately, I think it's up to each state to make its own choice on this issue.",
            "Honestly, I'm not at all in agreement with this. Let me think for a moment. I suppose it's worth noting that Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're basically sharing it with the public. If you look at the definition of a bulletin, it's essentially a post intended for others to see. So, if you post something online, you have to be aware that it's going to be seen by others, including school officials, even if it's not under the school's name. They could still access it from their homes, after all. \n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring the internet to prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine that they're doing it. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. I mean, if they're looking through Myspace to catch students engaging in underage drinking or other prohibited activities, I do think that's an invasion of privacy. However, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nI think it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing, and it's true that Myspace is a public platform. If a student posts something on Myspace and then gets in trouble for it, that's not unusual. I'm careful about what I post online, like even in emails. I'm worried that something I say could come back to haunt me later.\n\nIf you post something as a college student, it's likely to follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever, and there's no taking it back. If you do something that gets you in trouble, you'll have to face the consequences. I don't think this is an invasion of privacy, because as I said before, Myspace is a public platform. What I'm saying is that I don't think school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's okay. When parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment, and that's what the school officials were trying to achieve in this case. They were just taking precautions to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nMy teacher discussed this with me at my public high school, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is safe. They did drills and lockdowns in case of a terrorist attack, and it's similar to what happened with the school shooting. They were just trying to make the school a safer place, and that's what the school officials were doing in this case – taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.",
            "Honestly, I've had time to reflect on our decision to go to war, and my perspective has shifted. To be frank, I was initially all for it because it was a deeply personal issue for me, especially after 9/11. I felt a strong desire to make a difference and cause chaos, just like they had done to us. However, I now think we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into it without a clear plan.\n\nI believe that the emotional toll of 9/11 clouded our judgment, and we went in unprepared. Unfortunately, this led to a disastrous outcome. I've come to realize that as long as the different factions over there are fighting each other, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't be there to try to fix their problems; instead, we should focus on our own security.\n\nTo be honest, I've lost interest in the conflict and those people. It's hard to care about their struggles when they can't even cooperate with each other. I think we went in there with a misguided sense of purpose, fueled by emotions rather than reason. We were looking for revenge, and President Bush seemed to be driven by public opinion and a desire to take action. However, I understand his perspective at the time.\n\nI don't think we had a choice but to respond to the situation, but I do think we could have done it differently. We should have had a clearer plan for creating order and a more unified effort. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case, and we ended up creating more chaos.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're capable of changing those people; they're stuck in their ways. We're just prolonging our own suffering by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify our continued involvement. In the end, it's only a matter of time before things fall apart, and we can't stay there forever. I genuinely believe we're doing more harm than good by remaining there."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nI feel like the war has been drawn out far too much \nI think the purpose was good in the beginning \nUm \nMeaning to restore democracy in another country \nBut \nI think we’ve long since lost sight of that purpose \nAnd \nWe’re now just maybe doing it for the sake of doing it \nJust to prove that we’re some sort of super power in the world \nI just think also maybe the motives were originally questionable dealing with \nUm \nGeorge Bush’s father’s previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein \nSo \nI think \nUm \nI think the original motivation if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system then that would be a fair motivation if there were any personal matters in it I do not think it would have been fair \nBut \nI do think it’s been drawn out \nUm \nI think we got our purpose across in the first couple months just starting the war I think that was a statement in and of itself \nBut \nThe fact that it has gone on for over a year several years \nI just think it’s way too drawn out \n\nUm \nYeah I think \nUm \nI mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country that was ruled by a tyrant I think that’s a just purpose \nAnd \nThat’s good reason for the war \nBut \nI don’t think \nI think our reason over time has been deteriorated \nAnd \nMisconceived \nJust like seems that we’re still at war for the purpose of going to war \nAnd \nWe don’t want to come out of this thing without a decisive end a victory or what not \n\nUm \nYeah I do think it has gone on long enough \nAnd \nIt should stop \nI mean there comes a point when their government \nTheir officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway \nAnd \nI think that time has come \nWe’ve long since been draining our own economy spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf such as poverty and what not that we should be spending that money on I think it’s a drain on our economy for a purpose that’s long since been drawn out \n\nYeah I mean they’re spending billions and billions of dollars \nAnd \nWar is not something that should be in our budget for the long term \nThere are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements \nYou know \nUm \nPublic roads or anything dealing with schools \nWe certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that \nHealth care that I think that money could be much better spent on \nRight now that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we’ve lost the cause for \n\nI think that’s it \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to rethink some of its stances and make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. They have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated in my opinion. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, they might not be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and I think that's because they feel the Church is on the wrong side.\n\nI mean, if you're in favor of abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. And if you're gay or support gay marriage, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests – it's not like it would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe they would have done things differently, but it's hard to say.\n\nOne thing I do think the Church should reconsider is its stance on priests being allowed to be married. They say priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's a pretty unique job situation. Everyone else with a job has both a career and a personal life – so, I don't see why priests can't have both too.",
            "Honestly, I wanted to take a moment to clarify my thoughts on a sensitive topic. I've been considering this issue, and I don't think I'm opposed to the idea of gay marriage. It seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it would be unfair to hold gay people accountable for their natural inclinations.\n\nWhen I think about it, it doesn't seem right that society would deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their orientation. I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, but my gut feeling is that it's wrong for anyone to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they can control, just like how I'm naturally straight and others are naturally gay. It's not a choice that I think they should be held accountable for.\n\nTo me, it's clear that the federal government shouldn't involve themselves in this issue. It's not really a matter of the law, and it's certainly not a moral issue in my opinion. I don't think they have the right to dictate who can and can't get married based on something as personal as their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's a sensitive topic, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable discussing it, but I do think the federal government should stay out of it. It's not their place to interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as who they love. It's just not something they should be involved in.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. A lot of people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not true. It's two different things, you can't compare them. They're like two sides of the same coin - one isn't better than the other. People have the right to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, which are often denied to gay couples because they're not considered 'family'. It's crazy that if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't even be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. That's pretty shallow if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples. It's basically the same thing - a relationship is a relationship, and that's what matters. The problem is that people get hung up on the idea that gay couples want to get married in a church, but that's not true. They just want a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are treated unfairly, and it's not right. They have the same relationship dynamics, the same roles, and the same goals as straight couples. People worry about adoption and community issues, but those are separate problems. They're worried about how gay couples will affect their community, and how children of gay couples will turn out. But it's not that simple.\n\nIn New York City, for example, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. It's not fair. And it shows that the real issue is not the parents, but the society we live in. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples, and it's all about personal choices. The government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage, which align with his views on abortion and stem cell research, but that's not a good reason to deny people their rights. Morality is subjective, and it's not okay to impose someone's morality on the rest of the country. It's hypocritical to allow some people to enforce their religious views on everyone else. People are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect, but that's not supported by science. The American Psychological Association has disproven those claims, and it's time to listen to experts, not just popular opinion.",
            "Okay, so one thing - I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, people often think that just because something is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't have its good qualities. I mean, take it from a medical perspective. If a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it can't be beneficial. I'm not saying it should be available to the general public, no way, that's not where I'm coming from. But for medicinal purposes, I definitely think it's a different story. We don't use illegal substances in pharmacies because they're bad, but because they have benefits that we can harness.\n\nI mean, take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets - they're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Just because there's a stigma surrounding marijuana doesn't mean we should ignore its potential benefits. I think we should be open to its advantages, not dismiss it because of its current status.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is similar to alcohol in terms of abuse potential - while abusing either substance can lead to problems, marijuana's impact is different. I think we should approach its legalization gradually, but not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to get rid of the negative image surrounding marijuana. People have a skewed view of it because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made efforts to adapt to the modern era, becoming less strict than it used to be. Even from my own experience of attending church every Sunday as a kid, I've noticed the changes. I used to get all dressed up in cute outfits and go to a private school where I'd see my friends on the weekends. But now, especially during the summer, people show up to mass in casual beachwear, and even the morning masses are more relaxed, with people wearing jeans or khakis. It's definitely become a more casual atmosphere, which I think is a natural progression.\n\nAs for the bigger picture, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the problems with pedophilia in the Catholic Church. There are married individuals who still have a twisted attraction to young kids, and it's not solely because of their marital status. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should consider whether they can commit to the lifestyle. Some other religions, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church, allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's impossible to balance faith and marriage in this way.\n\nI think the root of the issue is that pedophilia is often an inborn trait, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing or environment. While genetics might play a role, you can't hide it through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's despicable, but I don't think that's always the case.\n\nOverall, the church's changes haven't had a significant impact on preventing these problems. My thoughts on the matter are that it's a complex issue, and I don't have any other specific opinions about the Catholic Church beyond that.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I believe that going to Iraq was partly a pretext. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but that turned out to be false. This whole thing bothered me, and the Iraq war really gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell, who presented that big UN speech, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious offense - lying to the public like that is unacceptable. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution and has been working to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they had a plan to go to war from the start.\n\nOne thing that really stands out is how the younger Bush seemed to have a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's past dealings with him, and I think he was also hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to reevaluate the situation, but withdrawing now could lead to even more problems, including a civil war that would result in more deaths. The current alternative being considered is a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to stabilize the country. However, I'm not sure that's the best idea, as it could create more problems in the long run, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The country's interim government is already showing signs of breaking down, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister has limited control, and radical elements are vying for power, causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know how to articulate my concerns in polite conversation.",
            "I'm still trying to process my thoughts about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's been a bit complicated for me. I think what's making it harder is that it wasn't even officially declared as a war. It just felt like a way to get back at someone after the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're stuck over there trying to build a democracy, which is a long-term goal, and also to get access to their resources. But the thing is, it's causing a lot of problems and making people upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to deal with the aftermath of trying to create a democracy, which won't happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing things up and having to start over. I'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nTo be honest, I'm really struggling to form an opinion on this. It's a complex topic, and I don't think I fully understand it. I think we should talk more about this and get a better grasp on the situation.\n\nI've been thinking, and I don't think we should call it a war anymore. It was never officially declared, and it's just become a way to show off our military strength. I think that's not the point of it all. It's about helping people, not just flexing our muscles.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but at the same time, we're wasting our resources, and it's making the President look bad. I'm not sure how much longer we can justify staying there. It's kind of like the Vietnam War – it was an undeclared war, and now it's considered a pointless war. I don't want our President to be known as the one who started a meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are people I know who have family members over there, and I want them to be safe. But at the same time, I don't want us to be there because it's messing with their culture and way of life. We're trying to change them into something they're not, and it's just making things worse. I think we're actually making the Al-Kaida problem worse by trying to impose our own values on them.\n\nI think this whole thing is going to drag on for years and years, and I'm not sure what the outcome will be. I guess that's just my two cents on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state to declare something as legal or to make laws about it. In my opinion, that's a decision that should be left to the churches. The constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any form of state control over this issue would be a direct defiance of what's already been written.\n\nI think people trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with some areas like Boston being exceptions. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't dictate as right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think making an amendment to restrict this would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict people's rights rather than the government's, and I don't believe that's right.\n\nTo me, the government should stay out of this issue altogether. I don't see why there's a push for this amendment, except that it's against the president's own personal beliefs as a Catholic. By pushing for this amendment, he's showing that he's favoring one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any real reason for this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In the end, I've said what I think, and I don't think there's anything more to add.",
            "Okay, let's start from the beginning - I think the US government was not completely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq, and I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks in a way that wasn't entirely justified. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion in 2003. Personally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the invasion of Iraq was a repeat of some of the mistakes made in the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The American government didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the power vacuum that followed. They were trying to establish a democratic government, but it's a complex and difficult process that takes years, as we saw in our own country's struggle for democracy.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the transition would be smooth and easy, but it's been a long and hard ordeal. We're still in Iraq, and it's been almost the year 2007, with many American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their own country. I think the government was naive to think it would be a short and successful stay, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make to continue the war, especially when we've been there for so long. Once you're in, it's hard to just leave, especially since we're the ones who took away their government and way of life. However, it's also hard to keep risking the lives of American soldiers for what seems like an endless war. The real reason we're focusing on Iraq, I think, is because of the significant oil resources there and the desire to control them.\n\nI'm also concerned that the US government isn't being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. They claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found, and yet we're not taking action against other countries with known WMDs, like North Korea. I just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it seems unlikely.",
            "Okay, let's see... I'm all for gay marriage; I've always been. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and research has increasingly shown that it's biological rather than a product of social influences. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights due to something that's not within their control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think governments or politics should have a say in this; it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their households. Take my neighborhood, for instance, where there are a few openly gay couples living together. They function just like any other family, and it's hard to see why their relationships should be treated differently. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush would try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it according to their own whims.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard from various sources, there's evidence that being gay may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. For example, if someone grows up with four sisters and no father figure, that doesn't necessarily determine their sexual orientation.\n\nIn any case, it seems that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a major public spectacle, splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've dealt with this before. Once you put something on the internet, you can't take it back. It influences how people perceive you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. It's only a matter of time before someone sees it and shares it. Since the internet is public domain, even if it's a private profile, your friends on Myspace will receive the bulletin. In this case, it wasn't the school that received it, but someone who was concerned enough to report it. The school can't just ignore it, as they have a responsibility to act on potential threats to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nI understand that some people might just be joking around, but it's hard to tell what's a joke and what's not. It's like that situation we had at school, where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's friend checked their Facebook and was worried about some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone. When you post something online, you're essentially giving up your right to privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to it. While I think it's a bad idea for school officials to be friends with their students on social media, if something is brought to their attention, they can't just ignore it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you've given access to your online profile reports something that could pose a threat. If it's a genuine concern, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also believe that teachers shouldn't create fake social media accounts to keep an eye on their students. That's just not their place. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, especially if they're posting about activities I'm not supposed to be aware of. I don't want that kind of responsibility or the potential conflict that comes with it.",
            "I feel like this war has been dragging on for far too long. Initially, I believed the goal was commendable – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective and are now fighting for our own sake, proving our status as a world power. The original motivation, tied to George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, raises questions about its validity. If the intention was genuinely to introduce democracy to a nation lacking a fair system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that's the case.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the early stages of the war – it was a statement in itself. But the prolonged duration, spanning over a year and more, is excessive. If our original goal was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a noble cause. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, with it seeming that we're fighting just to be at war.\n\nI do believe it's time to bring this to an end. The Iraqi government will eventually have to fend for themselves; our continued involvement is draining our economy, with billions of dollars being spent on a war that's lost its purpose. We have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public roads, and healthcare, which could be better funded with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's disheartening to see our citizens being killed in a war that's no longer serving its intended purpose.",
            "I was wondering if I could get a clarification on something, but I guess it's kind of a complex issue. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like a certain situation. I'm not sure if that's an invasion of privacy, but I think it's worth exploring. On sites like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. You have to be a member to access someone's profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to see your stuff. It's the same with any information you put online - you have to be aware that lots of people will see it. In this case, I think it's a good thing that someone saw that info and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, I can see why it might be tough to have someone constantly monitoring people's profiles, especially if it's discriminatory. It's not right to single out certain individuals, and it's not feasible to have someone's job be to browse through everyone's profiles. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking or were they actively searching for something? I'm not sure.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a documentary about someone who showed how easy it is to get information online, and it was pretty disturbing. They were able to get a girl's screen name and meet with her in under a minute. It's hard because you think you're safe, but you're not. I've had people from my classes IM me, even though they don't know my real name. They know what I look like, my interests, and even my class schedule. I try to limit what I put online, but it's a tricky balance between keeping it private and being able to communicate with friends.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she told me about a situation in her high school where students were banned from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the power to do that, and it seems like a privacy issue to me. I don't know if I agree with it, but it's definitely an interesting topic to consider.",
            "I'm thinking about the Iraq War, and I'm hesitant to express my opinion because I feel like I'm just jumping on a bandwagon.  However, my initial stance against the war still stands, and I'm not just following the crowd. \n\nThe fact that most of the world shares my opinion is undeniable.  Polls have consistently shown that around seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide believe that the war was a mistake.  This includes a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it's a bad idea and want us to withdraw within a year.  It's clear that the situation has been a disaster from the beginning, and we're struggling to find a way out.\n\nThe cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem to be a significant obstacle.  We have a vastly different understanding of how to govern and live in a society, and trying to impose our system on them isn't working out.  I think it's naive to believe that we can bring democracy to a region where it's not wanted.  Saddam Hussein was certainly a bad guy, but we need to consider the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a quagmire.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.  I'm not buying into the administration's ideas about why we should stay, and I haven't heard a convincing argument for it.  If they want to withdraw gradually over the course of a year or more, I'd be okay with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now.  It's worth noting that a significant portion of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and even more think we should leave immediately.  These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight.\n\nIf we asked them if we should stay, and they said no, it would be hard to argue with their decision.  If things go wrong after we leave, we can at least say that it was their decision, not ours.  If we choose to help them after that, we might be seen as the good guys, but let's be realistic – we'll never be seen as heroes in the Middle East.  All we can do is try to minimize the damage and get out as soon as possible.",
            "I completely agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, though - certain industries and societal norms can make it tough for both men and women to succeed. In many careers, women face a 'glass ceiling' where, despite being qualified, they're overlooked for promotions due to historical biases. This isn't unique to women, though; men in non-traditional roles like stay-at-home dads also face prejudice. People often assume men should be the primary breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home are judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men who are genuinely interested in fashion are often taken less seriously because their interests don't fit traditional male stereotypes. \n\nThis slow change is partly due to the deeply ingrained mindset in society. Although we've made significant progress since the 1800s, it's still a long way to go. However, I believe we're moving in the right direction. Women are breaking through glass ceilings and becoming CEOs, and people are becoming more accepting of stay-at-home dads. As a result, we're starting to see a shift in how we view these non-traditional roles. To promote further change, we need to showcase the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped against. Rather than forcing it, which can lead to resistance, we should highlight their capabilities in a subtle yet effective way. I think we're at a good point where we're starting to see the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and regions can face discrimination based on their upbringing, education, or accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional education background might be judged by those with more 'refined' speech or education. This is another example of how various factors can contribute to discrimination, not just gender. \n\nI'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that hasn't already been done. If we push too hard for change, people might resist, and progress would be slowed. We need to find a balance between promoting equality and respecting people's differences. Our slow but steady progress is a step in the right direction, and I'm hopeful that we'll continue to move forward.",
            "I think it's been clarified that marijuana wasn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but more like a traffic ticket. If someone gets caught and cited, it's unlikely to have severe consequences in the long run, especially when it comes to things like job interviews. However, even with decriminalization, there are still concerns about the potential repercussions, which can be a major worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a valid argument that arresting people for marijuana possession is costly for cities, from the initial arrest to court appearances and public defenders. This can be a significant financial burden, especially for municipalities struggling financially. Even so, some cities are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community programs.\n\nDenver, however, is a different story. Given its more open-minded and progressive attitude, I think it's perfectly fine that they've decriminalized marijuana. The extra funding can be used for things like public education, social programs for seniors, and food programs for the homeless. It's not a straightforward decision, as there are valid reasons to be cautious about marijuana being everywhere, but there's also a financial aspect to consider.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it's possible that it could become as prevalent as cigarettes, which could lead to people smoking and driving, and other issues. It's still a bit taboo in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward for some people. While I'm not sure what I would think about that, I do know that marijuana can have different effects on people, just like alcohol. Some people can handle it better than others, and it's hard to generalize how people will react.\n\nI think both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's essential to acknowledge that people respond differently to substances. Some people can be more moderate, while others might not be able to control their consumption. It's a complex issue, but I do believe that both substances have their own unique consequences.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to making some changes because a lot of the practices are quite traditional. They've stuck to the same methods for a long time, and it's good to have roots in tradition. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church can be quite rigid in its expectations and doesn't accept people who don't live up to their doctrine perfectly. They also tend to be quite exclusive when it comes to people from other religions, like my parents, who are Episcopalians. They refused to let my parents get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's background.\n\nThis isn't exactly what you'd call being tolerant of other faiths. We're taught to love others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say that and not practice it. I think the Catholic Church's doctrine often conflicts with its practices, which can be quite outdated. They stick to their traditional ways even when they're no longer relevant.\n\nI don't think my personal views would necessarily change the situation, but personally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to get married. However, I'm not convinced that this would deter priests who engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a different issue altogether, and people who would do such things would probably do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIt's worth noting that people who abuse children tend to do so because of the power imbalance, not because of their marital status. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily stop these kinds of incidents from happening. It's unlikely that this would make a significant difference.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this issue, and I'm not sure if there's a right or wrong side to take. What I do know is that this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with right now. The line between separating church and state is a delicate one, and defining marriage is a sensitive matter that can be tricky to navigate without offending anyone. \n\nI'm thinking that maybe we should look at all civil unions as just that – a union between two people, without the government looking into whether it was a religious or secular ceremony. I mean, if it's just about two people coming together, then why should the government care what kind of marriage it is? It's about the bond between the individuals, not about what the government thinks of it. \n\nThe thing is, if gay marriage is seen as just another type of civil union, then it shouldn't be a problem. It's all about two people coming together, and that's what counts. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it would be great if we could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage through a constitutional amendment is extreme – it's not the kind of thing that should be decided by amending the constitution.\n\nI just don't think it's worth altering the constitution for a cause that's not big enough. It's a serious issue for some people, but it's not something that should warrant changing the foundation of our country. It's just not that important to define and ban gay marriage by amending the constitution. Let's keep it simple – it's about two people coming together. \n\nI don't know, but that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, where things got a bit hazy when it came to homosexuality. Having lots of gay friends made me think a lot about this issue, and I didn't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, but I do think it should be legalized. I think it's crazy to make it a national issue, and instead, each state should have its own say. It's like, some states are super liberal and others are more conservative, so I don't think the president should impose their views on everyone. If you live in a state that's liberal, you know how they feel about it, and if you don't like it, maybe you shouldn't move there. I think everyone should have the same opportunities, so it should be up to each state to decide. I already kind of said that, but yeah. I don't think it's right that Bush can decide for the whole country that gay marriage is against the law. He shouldn't get to dictate how each state runs itself. I mean, he's not gonna be in office forever, and if a new president comes in and thinks differently, the ban will just be lifted and then put back on again. It's simpler to just let each state decide for themselves, since they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, let me start again. I don't agree with the idea that the school acted unreasonably. I was thinking about this, and it seems like the school's actions might have been justified. Myspace is a public platform, and anything posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. Even if the post wasn't made under the school's name, officials could still access it from their homes. If going through Myspace can prevent a school shooting, which is the school's responsibility, then I think it's perfectly fine.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to monitor student behavior, like whether they're drinking or smoking. They're doing it to catch students and get them in trouble, which I think is an invasion of privacy. However, if it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion at all. It's a bit like if they searched homes to prevent a school shooting; it's all about keeping students safe.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express myself when writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that posting on Myspace is a public thing, and students shouldn't be surprised if they get in trouble. I'm cautious about posting stuff online, even emails, because you never know who might see it. If you do something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the consequences. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials can see it because it's a public platform.\n\nIf you do something wrong in college and grow up to be an important person, an old email can still come back to haunt you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials are doing it to make the school safer. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that they have to ensure the school is safe, like during lockdowns and drills.\n\nIn this case, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, which is their responsibility. They were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. So, I think they acted reasonably. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the war and our involvement in it. To be honest, my initial reaction was to support it after 9/11, which had a huge impact on me personally. I thought we should take action and show them the same level of devastation they brought to us. However, over time, I've come to realize that we jumped into this without a clear plan or understanding of the long-term consequences. \n\nUnfortunately, I think that's exactly what led to our problems. When emotions are running high, we tend to overlook the bigger picture. We went in there unprepared, not knowing what to expect, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nTo be frank, I've lost interest in the whole situation. As long as the people over there are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to focus on fighting us. It's quite evident that we're not making a difference; they're too busy infighting to care about us. Sometimes it feels like they're not even human, the way they conduct war. It's savage and brutal, and I don't think they're fighting for the betterment of their country – they just want us out.\n\nI think we should've taken a step back and thought this through before getting involved. We were driven by a desire for revenge, and President Bush declared war on Iraq largely in response to public sentiment. At the time, I understood his position, but now I believe we could've handled it differently. We were too focused on the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and we didn't have a clear plan for what we wanted to achieve in Iraq. \n\nIf we had unified our goals and strategies, we might have avoided some of the chaos we're seeing today. But that wasn't the case, and now I think we're stuck in a situation that's not working for us. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the people of Iraq; they're too entrenched in their ways, and we'll never be able to bring about lasting change.\n\nAs it stands, I don't think we're making enough progress to justify our continued presence in Iraq. We've achieved some things, but not enough to justify the costs. Once we leave, the situation will likely collapse, and we'll just be hurting ourselves by staying any longer. It's time to reassess our involvement and consider pulling out. That's my two cents on the matter."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to rethink some of its stances and make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. They have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated in my opinion. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, they might not be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and I think that's because they feel the Church is on the wrong side.\n\nI mean, if you're in favor of abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. And if you're gay or support gay marriage, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests – it's not like it would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe they would have done things differently, but it's hard to say.\n\nOne thing I do think the Church should reconsider is its stance on priests being allowed to be married. They say priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's a pretty unique job situation. Everyone else with a job has both a career and a personal life – so, I don't see why priests can't have both too.",
            "Honestly, I wanted to take a moment to clarify my thoughts on a sensitive topic. I've been considering this issue, and I don't think I'm opposed to the idea of gay marriage. It seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it would be unfair to hold gay people accountable for their natural inclinations.\n\nWhen I think about it, it doesn't seem right that society would deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their orientation. I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, but my gut feeling is that it's wrong for anyone to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they can control, just like how I'm naturally straight and others are naturally gay. It's not a choice that I think they should be held accountable for.\n\nTo me, it's clear that the federal government shouldn't involve themselves in this issue. It's not really a matter of the law, and it's certainly not a moral issue in my opinion. I don't think they have the right to dictate who can and can't get married based on something as personal as their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's a sensitive topic, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable discussing it, but I do think the federal government should stay out of it. It's not their place to interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as who they love. It's just not something they should be involved in.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. A lot of people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not true. It's two different things, you can't compare them. They're like two sides of the same coin - one isn't better than the other. People have the right to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, which are often denied to gay couples because they're not considered 'family'. It's crazy that if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't even be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. That's pretty shallow if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples. It's basically the same thing - a relationship is a relationship, and that's what matters. The problem is that people get hung up on the idea that gay couples want to get married in a church, but that's not true. They just want a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are treated unfairly, and it's not right. They have the same relationship dynamics, the same roles, and the same goals as straight couples. People worry about adoption and community issues, but those are separate problems. They're worried about how gay couples will affect their community, and how children of gay couples will turn out. But it's not that simple.\n\nIn New York City, for example, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. It's not fair. And it shows that the real issue is not the parents, but the society we live in. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples, and it's all about personal choices. The government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage, which align with his views on abortion and stem cell research, but that's not a good reason to deny people their rights. Morality is subjective, and it's not okay to impose someone's morality on the rest of the country. It's hypocritical to allow some people to enforce their religious views on everyone else. People are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect, but that's not supported by science. The American Psychological Association has disproven those claims, and it's time to listen to experts, not just popular opinion.",
            "Okay, so one thing - I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, people often think that just because something is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't have its good qualities. I mean, take it from a medical perspective. If a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it can't be beneficial. I'm not saying it should be available to the general public, no way, that's not where I'm coming from. But for medicinal purposes, I definitely think it's a different story. We don't use illegal substances in pharmacies because they're bad, but because they have benefits that we can harness.\n\nI mean, take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets - they're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Just because there's a stigma surrounding marijuana doesn't mean we should ignore its potential benefits. I think we should be open to its advantages, not dismiss it because of its current status.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is similar to alcohol in terms of abuse potential - while abusing either substance can lead to problems, marijuana's impact is different. I think we should approach its legalization gradually, but not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to get rid of the negative image surrounding marijuana. People have a skewed view of it because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made efforts to adapt to the modern era, becoming less strict than it used to be. Even from my own experience of attending church every Sunday as a kid, I've noticed the changes. I used to get all dressed up in cute outfits and go to a private school where I'd see my friends on the weekends. But now, especially during the summer, people show up to mass in casual beachwear, and even the morning masses are more relaxed, with people wearing jeans or khakis. It's definitely become a more casual atmosphere, which I think is a natural progression.\n\nAs for the bigger picture, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the problems with pedophilia in the Catholic Church. There are married individuals who still have a twisted attraction to young kids, and it's not solely because of their marital status. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should consider whether they can commit to the lifestyle. Some other religions, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church, allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's impossible to balance faith and marriage in this way.\n\nI think the root of the issue is that pedophilia is often an inborn trait, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing or environment. While genetics might play a role, you can't hide it through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's despicable, but I don't think that's always the case.\n\nOverall, the church's changes haven't had a significant impact on preventing these problems. My thoughts on the matter are that it's a complex issue, and I don't have any other specific opinions about the Catholic Church beyond that.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I believe that going to Iraq was partly a pretext. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but that turned out to be false. This whole thing bothered me, and the Iraq war really gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell, who presented that big UN speech, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious offense - lying to the public like that is unacceptable. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution and has been working to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they had a plan to go to war from the start.\n\nOne thing that really stands out is how the younger Bush seemed to have a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's past dealings with him, and I think he was also hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to reevaluate the situation, but withdrawing now could lead to even more problems, including a civil war that would result in more deaths. The current alternative being considered is a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to stabilize the country. However, I'm not sure that's the best idea, as it could create more problems in the long run, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The country's interim government is already showing signs of breaking down, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister has limited control, and radical elements are vying for power, causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know how to articulate my concerns in polite conversation.",
            "I'm still trying to process my thoughts about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's been a bit complicated for me. I think what's making it harder is that it wasn't even officially declared as a war. It just felt like a way to get back at someone after the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're stuck over there trying to build a democracy, which is a long-term goal, and also to get access to their resources. But the thing is, it's causing a lot of problems and making people upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to deal with the aftermath of trying to create a democracy, which won't happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing things up and having to start over. I'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nTo be honest, I'm really struggling to form an opinion on this. It's a complex topic, and I don't think I fully understand it. I think we should talk more about this and get a better grasp on the situation.\n\nI've been thinking, and I don't think we should call it a war anymore. It was never officially declared, and it's just become a way to show off our military strength. I think that's not the point of it all. It's about helping people, not just flexing our muscles.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but at the same time, we're wasting our resources, and it's making the President look bad. I'm not sure how much longer we can justify staying there. It's kind of like the Vietnam War – it was an undeclared war, and now it's considered a pointless war. I don't want our President to be known as the one who started a meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are people I know who have family members over there, and I want them to be safe. But at the same time, I don't want us to be there because it's messing with their culture and way of life. We're trying to change them into something they're not, and it's just making things worse. I think we're actually making the Al-Kaida problem worse by trying to impose our own values on them.\n\nI think this whole thing is going to drag on for years and years, and I'm not sure what the outcome will be. I guess that's just my two cents on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state to declare something as legal or to make laws about it. In my opinion, that's a decision that should be left to the churches. The constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any form of state control over this issue would be a direct defiance of what's already been written.\n\nI think people trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with some areas like Boston being exceptions. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't dictate as right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think making an amendment to restrict this would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict people's rights rather than the government's, and I don't believe that's right.\n\nTo me, the government should stay out of this issue altogether. I don't see why there's a push for this amendment, except that it's against the president's own personal beliefs as a Catholic. By pushing for this amendment, he's showing that he's favoring one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any real reason for this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In the end, I've said what I think, and I don't think there's anything more to add.",
            "Okay, let's start from the beginning - I think the US government was not completely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq, and I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks in a way that wasn't entirely justified. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion in 2003. Personally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the invasion of Iraq was a repeat of some of the mistakes made in the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The American government didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the power vacuum that followed. They were trying to establish a democratic government, but it's a complex and difficult process that takes years, as we saw in our own country's struggle for democracy.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the transition would be smooth and easy, but it's been a long and hard ordeal. We're still in Iraq, and it's been almost the year 2007, with many American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their own country. I think the government was naive to think it would be a short and successful stay, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make to continue the war, especially when we've been there for so long. Once you're in, it's hard to just leave, especially since we're the ones who took away their government and way of life. However, it's also hard to keep risking the lives of American soldiers for what seems like an endless war. The real reason we're focusing on Iraq, I think, is because of the significant oil resources there and the desire to control them.\n\nI'm also concerned that the US government isn't being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. They claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found, and yet we're not taking action against other countries with known WMDs, like North Korea. I just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it seems unlikely.",
            "Okay, let's see... I'm all for gay marriage; I've always been. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and research has increasingly shown that it's biological rather than a product of social influences. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights due to something that's not within their control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think governments or politics should have a say in this; it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their households. Take my neighborhood, for instance, where there are a few openly gay couples living together. They function just like any other family, and it's hard to see why their relationships should be treated differently. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush would try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it according to their own whims.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard from various sources, there's evidence that being gay may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. For example, if someone grows up with four sisters and no father figure, that doesn't necessarily determine their sexual orientation.\n\nIn any case, it seems that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a major public spectacle, splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've dealt with this before. Once you put something on the internet, you can't take it back. It influences how people perceive you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. It's only a matter of time before someone sees it and shares it. Since the internet is public domain, even if it's a private profile, your friends on Myspace will receive the bulletin. In this case, it wasn't the school that received it, but someone who was concerned enough to report it. The school can't just ignore it, as they have a responsibility to act on potential threats to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nI understand that some people might just be joking around, but it's hard to tell what's a joke and what's not. It's like that situation we had at school, where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's friend checked their Facebook and was worried about some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone. When you post something online, you're essentially giving up your right to privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to it. While I think it's a bad idea for school officials to be friends with their students on social media, if something is brought to their attention, they can't just ignore it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you've given access to your online profile reports something that could pose a threat. If it's a genuine concern, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also believe that teachers shouldn't create fake social media accounts to keep an eye on their students. That's just not their place. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, especially if they're posting about activities I'm not supposed to be aware of. I don't want that kind of responsibility or the potential conflict that comes with it.",
            "I feel like this war has been dragging on for far too long. Initially, I believed the goal was commendable – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective and are now fighting for our own sake, proving our status as a world power. The original motivation, tied to George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, raises questions about its validity. If the intention was genuinely to introduce democracy to a nation lacking a fair system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that's the case.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the early stages of the war – it was a statement in itself. But the prolonged duration, spanning over a year and more, is excessive. If our original goal was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a noble cause. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, with it seeming that we're fighting just to be at war.\n\nI do believe it's time to bring this to an end. The Iraqi government will eventually have to fend for themselves; our continued involvement is draining our economy, with billions of dollars being spent on a war that's lost its purpose. We have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public roads, and healthcare, which could be better funded with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's disheartening to see our citizens being killed in a war that's no longer serving its intended purpose.",
            "I was wondering if I could get a clarification on something, but I guess it's kind of a complex issue. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like a certain situation. I'm not sure if that's an invasion of privacy, but I think it's worth exploring. On sites like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. You have to be a member to access someone's profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to see your stuff. It's the same with any information you put online - you have to be aware that lots of people will see it. In this case, I think it's a good thing that someone saw that info and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, I can see why it might be tough to have someone constantly monitoring people's profiles, especially if it's discriminatory. It's not right to single out certain individuals, and it's not feasible to have someone's job be to browse through everyone's profiles. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking or were they actively searching for something? I'm not sure.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a documentary about someone who showed how easy it is to get information online, and it was pretty disturbing. They were able to get a girl's screen name and meet with her in under a minute. It's hard because you think you're safe, but you're not. I've had people from my classes IM me, even though they don't know my real name. They know what I look like, my interests, and even my class schedule. I try to limit what I put online, but it's a tricky balance between keeping it private and being able to communicate with friends.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she told me about a situation in her high school where students were banned from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the power to do that, and it seems like a privacy issue to me. I don't know if I agree with it, but it's definitely an interesting topic to consider.",
            "I'm thinking about the Iraq War, and I'm hesitant to express my opinion because I feel like I'm just jumping on a bandwagon.  However, my initial stance against the war still stands, and I'm not just following the crowd. \n\nThe fact that most of the world shares my opinion is undeniable.  Polls have consistently shown that around seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide believe that the war was a mistake.  This includes a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it's a bad idea and want us to withdraw within a year.  It's clear that the situation has been a disaster from the beginning, and we're struggling to find a way out.\n\nThe cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem to be a significant obstacle.  We have a vastly different understanding of how to govern and live in a society, and trying to impose our system on them isn't working out.  I think it's naive to believe that we can bring democracy to a region where it's not wanted.  Saddam Hussein was certainly a bad guy, but we need to consider the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a quagmire.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.  I'm not buying into the administration's ideas about why we should stay, and I haven't heard a convincing argument for it.  If they want to withdraw gradually over the course of a year or more, I'd be okay with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now.  It's worth noting that a significant portion of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and even more think we should leave immediately.  These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight.\n\nIf we asked them if we should stay, and they said no, it would be hard to argue with their decision.  If things go wrong after we leave, we can at least say that it was their decision, not ours.  If we choose to help them after that, we might be seen as the good guys, but let's be realistic – we'll never be seen as heroes in the Middle East.  All we can do is try to minimize the damage and get out as soon as possible.",
            "I completely agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, though - certain industries and societal norms can make it tough for both men and women to succeed. In many careers, women face a 'glass ceiling' where, despite being qualified, they're overlooked for promotions due to historical biases. This isn't unique to women, though; men in non-traditional roles like stay-at-home dads also face prejudice. People often assume men should be the primary breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home are judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men who are genuinely interested in fashion are often taken less seriously because their interests don't fit traditional male stereotypes. \n\nThis slow change is partly due to the deeply ingrained mindset in society. Although we've made significant progress since the 1800s, it's still a long way to go. However, I believe we're moving in the right direction. Women are breaking through glass ceilings and becoming CEOs, and people are becoming more accepting of stay-at-home dads. As a result, we're starting to see a shift in how we view these non-traditional roles. To promote further change, we need to showcase the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped against. Rather than forcing it, which can lead to resistance, we should highlight their capabilities in a subtle yet effective way. I think we're at a good point where we're starting to see the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and regions can face discrimination based on their upbringing, education, or accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional education background might be judged by those with more 'refined' speech or education. This is another example of how various factors can contribute to discrimination, not just gender. \n\nI'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that hasn't already been done. If we push too hard for change, people might resist, and progress would be slowed. We need to find a balance between promoting equality and respecting people's differences. Our slow but steady progress is a step in the right direction, and I'm hopeful that we'll continue to move forward.",
            "I think it's been clarified that marijuana wasn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but more like a traffic ticket. If someone gets caught and cited, it's unlikely to have severe consequences in the long run, especially when it comes to things like job interviews. However, even with decriminalization, there are still concerns about the potential repercussions, which can be a major worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a valid argument that arresting people for marijuana possession is costly for cities, from the initial arrest to court appearances and public defenders. This can be a significant financial burden, especially for municipalities struggling financially. Even so, some cities are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community programs.\n\nDenver, however, is a different story. Given its more open-minded and progressive attitude, I think it's perfectly fine that they've decriminalized marijuana. The extra funding can be used for things like public education, social programs for seniors, and food programs for the homeless. It's not a straightforward decision, as there are valid reasons to be cautious about marijuana being everywhere, but there's also a financial aspect to consider.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it's possible that it could become as prevalent as cigarettes, which could lead to people smoking and driving, and other issues. It's still a bit taboo in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward for some people. While I'm not sure what I would think about that, I do know that marijuana can have different effects on people, just like alcohol. Some people can handle it better than others, and it's hard to generalize how people will react.\n\nI think both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's essential to acknowledge that people respond differently to substances. Some people can be more moderate, while others might not be able to control their consumption. It's a complex issue, but I do believe that both substances have their own unique consequences.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to making some changes because a lot of the practices are quite traditional. They've stuck to the same methods for a long time, and it's good to have roots in tradition. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church can be quite rigid in its expectations and doesn't accept people who don't live up to their doctrine perfectly. They also tend to be quite exclusive when it comes to people from other religions, like my parents, who are Episcopalians. They refused to let my parents get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's background.\n\nThis isn't exactly what you'd call being tolerant of other faiths. We're taught to love others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say that and not practice it. I think the Catholic Church's doctrine often conflicts with its practices, which can be quite outdated. They stick to their traditional ways even when they're no longer relevant.\n\nI don't think my personal views would necessarily change the situation, but personally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to get married. However, I'm not convinced that this would deter priests who engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a different issue altogether, and people who would do such things would probably do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIt's worth noting that people who abuse children tend to do so because of the power imbalance, not because of their marital status. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily stop these kinds of incidents from happening. It's unlikely that this would make a significant difference.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this issue, and I'm not sure if there's a right or wrong side to take. What I do know is that this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with right now. The line between separating church and state is a delicate one, and defining marriage is a sensitive matter that can be tricky to navigate without offending anyone. \n\nI'm thinking that maybe we should look at all civil unions as just that – a union between two people, without the government looking into whether it was a religious or secular ceremony. I mean, if it's just about two people coming together, then why should the government care what kind of marriage it is? It's about the bond between the individuals, not about what the government thinks of it. \n\nThe thing is, if gay marriage is seen as just another type of civil union, then it shouldn't be a problem. It's all about two people coming together, and that's what counts. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it would be great if we could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage through a constitutional amendment is extreme – it's not the kind of thing that should be decided by amending the constitution.\n\nI just don't think it's worth altering the constitution for a cause that's not big enough. It's a serious issue for some people, but it's not something that should warrant changing the foundation of our country. It's just not that important to define and ban gay marriage by amending the constitution. Let's keep it simple – it's about two people coming together. \n\nI don't know, but that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, where things got a bit hazy when it came to homosexuality. Having lots of gay friends made me think a lot about this issue, and I didn't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, but I do think it should be legalized. I think it's crazy to make it a national issue, and instead, each state should have its own say. It's like, some states are super liberal and others are more conservative, so I don't think the president should impose their views on everyone. If you live in a state that's liberal, you know how they feel about it, and if you don't like it, maybe you shouldn't move there. I think everyone should have the same opportunities, so it should be up to each state to decide. I already kind of said that, but yeah. I don't think it's right that Bush can decide for the whole country that gay marriage is against the law. He shouldn't get to dictate how each state runs itself. I mean, he's not gonna be in office forever, and if a new president comes in and thinks differently, the ban will just be lifted and then put back on again. It's simpler to just let each state decide for themselves, since they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, let me start again. I don't agree with the idea that the school acted unreasonably. I was thinking about this, and it seems like the school's actions might have been justified. Myspace is a public platform, and anything posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. Even if the post wasn't made under the school's name, officials could still access it from their homes. If going through Myspace can prevent a school shooting, which is the school's responsibility, then I think it's perfectly fine.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to monitor student behavior, like whether they're drinking or smoking. They're doing it to catch students and get them in trouble, which I think is an invasion of privacy. However, if it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion at all. It's a bit like if they searched homes to prevent a school shooting; it's all about keeping students safe.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express myself when writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that posting on Myspace is a public thing, and students shouldn't be surprised if they get in trouble. I'm cautious about posting stuff online, even emails, because you never know who might see it. If you do something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the consequences. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials can see it because it's a public platform.\n\nIf you do something wrong in college and grow up to be an important person, an old email can still come back to haunt you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials are doing it to make the school safer. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that they have to ensure the school is safe, like during lockdowns and drills.\n\nIn this case, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, which is their responsibility. They were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. So, I think they acted reasonably. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the war and our involvement in it. To be honest, my initial reaction was to support it after 9/11, which had a huge impact on me personally. I thought we should take action and show them the same level of devastation they brought to us. However, over time, I've come to realize that we jumped into this without a clear plan or understanding of the long-term consequences. \n\nUnfortunately, I think that's exactly what led to our problems. When emotions are running high, we tend to overlook the bigger picture. We went in there unprepared, not knowing what to expect, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nTo be frank, I've lost interest in the whole situation. As long as the people over there are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to focus on fighting us. It's quite evident that we're not making a difference; they're too busy infighting to care about us. Sometimes it feels like they're not even human, the way they conduct war. It's savage and brutal, and I don't think they're fighting for the betterment of their country – they just want us out.\n\nI think we should've taken a step back and thought this through before getting involved. We were driven by a desire for revenge, and President Bush declared war on Iraq largely in response to public sentiment. At the time, I understood his position, but now I believe we could've handled it differently. We were too focused on the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and we didn't have a clear plan for what we wanted to achieve in Iraq. \n\nIf we had unified our goals and strategies, we might have avoided some of the chaos we're seeing today. But that wasn't the case, and now I think we're stuck in a situation that's not working for us. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the people of Iraq; they're too entrenched in their ways, and we'll never be able to bring about lasting change.\n\nAs it stands, I don't think we're making enough progress to justify our continued presence in Iraq. We've achieved some things, but not enough to justify the costs. Once we leave, the situation will likely collapse, and we'll just be hurting ourselves by staying any longer. It's time to reassess our involvement and consider pulling out. That's my two cents on the matter."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to rethink some of its stances and make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. They have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated in my opinion. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, they might not be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and I think that's because they feel the Church is on the wrong side.\n\nI mean, if you're in favor of abortion, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. And if you're gay or support gay marriage, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests – it's not like it would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing. Maybe they would have done things differently, but it's hard to say.\n\nOne thing I do think the Church should reconsider is its stance on priests being allowed to be married. They say priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's a pretty unique job situation. Everyone else with a job has both a career and a personal life – so, I don't see why priests can't have both too.",
            "Honestly, I wanted to take a moment to clarify my thoughts on a sensitive topic. I've been considering this issue, and I don't think I'm opposed to the idea of gay marriage. It seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it would be unfair to hold gay people accountable for their natural inclinations.\n\nWhen I think about it, it doesn't seem right that society would deny two people of the same sex the right to get married just because of their orientation. I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, but my gut feeling is that it's wrong for anyone to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems to me that a person's sexual orientation isn't something they can control, just like how I'm naturally straight and others are naturally gay. It's not a choice that I think they should be held accountable for.\n\nTo me, it's clear that the federal government shouldn't involve themselves in this issue. It's not really a matter of the law, and it's certainly not a moral issue in my opinion. I don't think they have the right to dictate who can and can't get married based on something as personal as their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's a sensitive topic, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable discussing it, but I do think the federal government should stay out of it. It's not their place to interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as who they love. It's just not something they should be involved in.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. A lot of people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not true. It's two different things, you can't compare them. They're like two sides of the same coin - one isn't better than the other. People have the right to civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, which are often denied to gay couples because they're not considered 'family'. It's crazy that if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't even be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. That's pretty shallow if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples. It's basically the same thing - a relationship is a relationship, and that's what matters. The problem is that people get hung up on the idea that gay couples want to get married in a church, but that's not true. They just want a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are treated unfairly, and it's not right. They have the same relationship dynamics, the same roles, and the same goals as straight couples. People worry about adoption and community issues, but those are separate problems. They're worried about how gay couples will affect their community, and how children of gay couples will turn out. But it's not that simple.\n\nIn New York City, for example, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied in regular schools. It's not fair. And it shows that the real issue is not the parents, but the society we live in. Parenting skills are the same for gay and straight couples, and it's all about personal choices. The government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage, which align with his views on abortion and stem cell research, but that's not a good reason to deny people their rights. Morality is subjective, and it's not okay to impose someone's morality on the rest of the country. It's hypocritical to allow some people to enforce their religious views on everyone else. People are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect, but that's not supported by science. The American Psychological Association has disproven those claims, and it's time to listen to experts, not just popular opinion.",
            "Okay, so one thing - I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, people often think that just because something is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't have its good qualities. I mean, take it from a medical perspective. If a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it can't be beneficial. I'm not saying it should be available to the general public, no way, that's not where I'm coming from. But for medicinal purposes, I definitely think it's a different story. We don't use illegal substances in pharmacies because they're bad, but because they have benefits that we can harness.\n\nI mean, take oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets - they're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Just because there's a stigma surrounding marijuana doesn't mean we should ignore its potential benefits. I think we should be open to its advantages, not dismiss it because of its current status.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is similar to alcohol in terms of abuse potential - while abusing either substance can lead to problems, marijuana's impact is different. I think we should approach its legalization gradually, but not all at once, to prevent abuse. First, we need to get rid of the negative image surrounding marijuana. People have a skewed view of it because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made efforts to adapt to the modern era, becoming less strict than it used to be. Even from my own experience of attending church every Sunday as a kid, I've noticed the changes. I used to get all dressed up in cute outfits and go to a private school where I'd see my friends on the weekends. But now, especially during the summer, people show up to mass in casual beachwear, and even the morning masses are more relaxed, with people wearing jeans or khakis. It's definitely become a more casual atmosphere, which I think is a natural progression.\n\nAs for the bigger picture, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the problems with pedophilia in the Catholic Church. There are married individuals who still have a twisted attraction to young kids, and it's not solely because of their marital status. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should consider whether they can commit to the lifestyle. Some other religions, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church, allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's impossible to balance faith and marriage in this way.\n\nI think the root of the issue is that pedophilia is often an inborn trait, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing or environment. While genetics might play a role, you can't hide it through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's despicable, but I don't think that's always the case.\n\nOverall, the church's changes haven't had a significant impact on preventing these problems. My thoughts on the matter are that it's a complex issue, and I don't have any other specific opinions about the Catholic Church beyond that.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I believe that going to Iraq was partly a pretext. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but that turned out to be false. This whole thing bothered me, and the Iraq war really gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell, who presented that big UN speech, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious offense - lying to the public like that is unacceptable. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution and has been working to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they had a plan to go to war from the start.\n\nOne thing that really stands out is how the younger Bush seemed to have a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's past dealings with him, and I think he was also hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to reevaluate the situation, but withdrawing now could lead to even more problems, including a civil war that would result in more deaths. The current alternative being considered is a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to stabilize the country. However, I'm not sure that's the best idea, as it could create more problems in the long run, especially regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The country's interim government is already showing signs of breaking down, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister has limited control, and radical elements are vying for power, causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know how to articulate my concerns in polite conversation.",
            "I'm still trying to process my thoughts about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's been a bit complicated for me. I think what's making it harder is that it wasn't even officially declared as a war. It just felt like a way to get back at someone after the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're stuck over there trying to build a democracy, which is a long-term goal, and also to get access to their resources. But the thing is, it's causing a lot of problems and making people upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to deal with the aftermath of trying to create a democracy, which won't happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing things up and having to start over. I'm not sure what the best approach is.\n\nTo be honest, I'm really struggling to form an opinion on this. It's a complex topic, and I don't think I fully understand it. I think we should talk more about this and get a better grasp on the situation.\n\nI've been thinking, and I don't think we should call it a war anymore. It was never officially declared, and it's just become a way to show off our military strength. I think that's not the point of it all. It's about helping people, not just flexing our muscles.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but at the same time, we're wasting our resources, and it's making the President look bad. I'm not sure how much longer we can justify staying there. It's kind of like the Vietnam War – it was an undeclared war, and now it's considered a pointless war. I don't want our President to be known as the one who started a meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are people I know who have family members over there, and I want them to be safe. But at the same time, I don't want us to be there because it's messing with their culture and way of life. We're trying to change them into something they're not, and it's just making things worse. I think we're actually making the Al-Kaida problem worse by trying to impose our own values on them.\n\nI think this whole thing is going to drag on for years and years, and I'm not sure what the outcome will be. I guess that's just my two cents on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state to declare something as legal or to make laws about it. In my opinion, that's a decision that should be left to the churches. The constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and I believe trying to enforce any form of state control over this issue would be a direct defiance of what's already been written.\n\nI think people trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with some areas like Boston being exceptions. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't dictate as right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think making an amendment to restrict this would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict people's rights rather than the government's, and I don't believe that's right.\n\nTo me, the government should stay out of this issue altogether. I don't see why there's a push for this amendment, except that it's against the president's own personal beliefs as a Catholic. By pushing for this amendment, he's showing that he's favoring one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any real reason for this amendment, other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In the end, I've said what I think, and I don't think there's anything more to add.",
            "Okay, let's start from the beginning - I think the US government was not completely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq, and I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks in a way that wasn't entirely justified. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion in 2003. Personally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the invasion of Iraq was a repeat of some of the mistakes made in the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The American government didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the power vacuum that followed. They were trying to establish a democratic government, but it's a complex and difficult process that takes years, as we saw in our own country's struggle for democracy.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the transition would be smooth and easy, but it's been a long and hard ordeal. We're still in Iraq, and it's been almost the year 2007, with many American troops still dying, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their own country. I think the government was naive to think it would be a short and successful stay, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make to continue the war, especially when we've been there for so long. Once you're in, it's hard to just leave, especially since we're the ones who took away their government and way of life. However, it's also hard to keep risking the lives of American soldiers for what seems like an endless war. The real reason we're focusing on Iraq, I think, is because of the significant oil resources there and the desire to control them.\n\nI'm also concerned that the US government isn't being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. They claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found, and yet we're not taking action against other countries with known WMDs, like North Korea. I just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it seems unlikely.",
            "Okay, let's see... I'm all for gay marriage; I've always been. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and research has increasingly shown that it's biological rather than a product of social influences. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights due to something that's not within their control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think governments or politics should have a say in this; it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their households. Take my neighborhood, for instance, where there are a few openly gay couples living together. They function just like any other family, and it's hard to see why their relationships should be treated differently. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush would try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it according to their own whims.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard from various sources, there's evidence that being gay may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. For example, if someone grows up with four sisters and no father figure, that doesn't necessarily determine their sexual orientation.\n\nIn any case, it seems that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a major public spectacle, splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've dealt with this before. Once you put something on the internet, you can't take it back. It influences how people perceive you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. It's only a matter of time before someone sees it and shares it. Since the internet is public domain, even if it's a private profile, your friends on Myspace will receive the bulletin. In this case, it wasn't the school that received it, but someone who was concerned enough to report it. The school can't just ignore it, as they have a responsibility to act on potential threats to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nI understand that some people might just be joking around, but it's hard to tell what's a joke and what's not. It's like that situation we had at school, where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's friend checked their Facebook and was worried about some posts that might have been meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone. When you post something online, you're essentially giving up your right to privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to it. While I think it's a bad idea for school officials to be friends with their students on social media, if something is brought to their attention, they can't just ignore it. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you've given access to your online profile reports something that could pose a threat. If it's a genuine concern, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also believe that teachers shouldn't create fake social media accounts to keep an eye on their students. That's just not their place. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, especially if they're posting about activities I'm not supposed to be aware of. I don't want that kind of responsibility or the potential conflict that comes with it.",
            "I feel like this war has been dragging on for far too long. Initially, I believed the goal was commendable – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective and are now fighting for our own sake, proving our status as a world power. The original motivation, tied to George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, raises questions about its validity. If the intention was genuinely to introduce democracy to a nation lacking a fair system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that's the case.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the early stages of the war – it was a statement in itself. But the prolonged duration, spanning over a year and more, is excessive. If our original goal was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a noble cause. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, with it seeming that we're fighting just to be at war.\n\nI do believe it's time to bring this to an end. The Iraqi government will eventually have to fend for themselves; our continued involvement is draining our economy, with billions of dollars being spent on a war that's lost its purpose. We have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public roads, and healthcare, which could be better funded with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's disheartening to see our citizens being killed in a war that's no longer serving its intended purpose.",
            "I was wondering if I could get a clarification on something, but I guess it's kind of a complex issue. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like a certain situation. I'm not sure if that's an invasion of privacy, but I think it's worth exploring. On sites like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. You have to be a member to access someone's profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to see your stuff. It's the same with any information you put online - you have to be aware that lots of people will see it. In this case, I think it's a good thing that someone saw that info and was able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nHowever, I can see why it might be tough to have someone constantly monitoring people's profiles, especially if it's discriminatory. It's not right to single out certain individuals, and it's not feasible to have someone's job be to browse through everyone's profiles. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking or were they actively searching for something? I'm not sure.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a documentary about someone who showed how easy it is to get information online, and it was pretty disturbing. They were able to get a girl's screen name and meet with her in under a minute. It's hard because you think you're safe, but you're not. I've had people from my classes IM me, even though they don't know my real name. They know what I look like, my interests, and even my class schedule. I try to limit what I put online, but it's a tricky balance between keeping it private and being able to communicate with friends.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she told me about a situation in her high school where students were banned from having Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the power to do that, and it seems like a privacy issue to me. I don't know if I agree with it, but it's definitely an interesting topic to consider.",
            "I'm thinking about the Iraq War, and I'm hesitant to express my opinion because I feel like I'm just jumping on a bandwagon.  However, my initial stance against the war still stands, and I'm not just following the crowd. \n\nThe fact that most of the world shares my opinion is undeniable.  Polls have consistently shown that around seventy-five to eighty percent of people worldwide believe that the war was a mistake.  This includes a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it's a bad idea and want us to withdraw within a year.  It's clear that the situation has been a disaster from the beginning, and we're struggling to find a way out.\n\nThe cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem to be a significant obstacle.  We have a vastly different understanding of how to govern and live in a society, and trying to impose our system on them isn't working out.  I think it's naive to believe that we can bring democracy to a region where it's not wanted.  Saddam Hussein was certainly a bad guy, but we need to consider the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a quagmire.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary.  I'm not buying into the administration's ideas about why we should stay, and I haven't heard a convincing argument for it.  If they want to withdraw gradually over the course of a year or more, I'd be okay with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now.  It's worth noting that a significant portion of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and even more think we should leave immediately.  These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight.\n\nIf we asked them if we should stay, and they said no, it would be hard to argue with their decision.  If things go wrong after we leave, we can at least say that it was their decision, not ours.  If we choose to help them after that, we might be seen as the good guys, but let's be realistic – we'll never be seen as heroes in the Middle East.  All we can do is try to minimize the damage and get out as soon as possible.",
            "I completely agree that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, though - certain industries and societal norms can make it tough for both men and women to succeed. In many careers, women face a 'glass ceiling' where, despite being qualified, they're overlooked for promotions due to historical biases. This isn't unique to women, though; men in non-traditional roles like stay-at-home dads also face prejudice. People often assume men should be the primary breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home are judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men who are genuinely interested in fashion are often taken less seriously because their interests don't fit traditional male stereotypes. \n\nThis slow change is partly due to the deeply ingrained mindset in society. Although we've made significant progress since the 1800s, it's still a long way to go. However, I believe we're moving in the right direction. Women are breaking through glass ceilings and becoming CEOs, and people are becoming more accepting of stay-at-home dads. As a result, we're starting to see a shift in how we view these non-traditional roles. To promote further change, we need to showcase the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped against. Rather than forcing it, which can lead to resistance, we should highlight their capabilities in a subtle yet effective way. I think we're at a good point where we're starting to see the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and regions can face discrimination based on their upbringing, education, or accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional education background might be judged by those with more 'refined' speech or education. This is another example of how various factors can contribute to discrimination, not just gender. \n\nI'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that hasn't already been done. If we push too hard for change, people might resist, and progress would be slowed. We need to find a balance between promoting equality and respecting people's differences. Our slow but steady progress is a step in the right direction, and I'm hopeful that we'll continue to move forward.",
            "I think it's been clarified that marijuana wasn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but more like a traffic ticket. If someone gets caught and cited, it's unlikely to have severe consequences in the long run, especially when it comes to things like job interviews. However, even with decriminalization, there are still concerns about the potential repercussions, which can be a major worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a valid argument that arresting people for marijuana possession is costly for cities, from the initial arrest to court appearances and public defenders. This can be a significant financial burden, especially for municipalities struggling financially. Even so, some cities are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community programs.\n\nDenver, however, is a different story. Given its more open-minded and progressive attitude, I think it's perfectly fine that they've decriminalized marijuana. The extra funding can be used for things like public education, social programs for seniors, and food programs for the homeless. It's not a straightforward decision, as there are valid reasons to be cautious about marijuana being everywhere, but there's also a financial aspect to consider.\n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it's possible that it could become as prevalent as cigarettes, which could lead to people smoking and driving, and other issues. It's still a bit taboo in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward for some people. While I'm not sure what I would think about that, I do know that marijuana can have different effects on people, just like alcohol. Some people can handle it better than others, and it's hard to generalize how people will react.\n\nI think both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's essential to acknowledge that people respond differently to substances. Some people can be more moderate, while others might not be able to control their consumption. It's a complex issue, but I do believe that both substances have their own unique consequences.",
            "To be honest, I'd say yes to making some changes because a lot of the practices are quite traditional. They've stuck to the same methods for a long time, and it's good to have roots in tradition. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church can be quite rigid in its expectations and doesn't accept people who don't live up to their doctrine perfectly. They also tend to be quite exclusive when it comes to people from other religions, like my parents, who are Episcopalians. They refused to let my parents get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's background.\n\nThis isn't exactly what you'd call being tolerant of other faiths. We're taught to love others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say that and not practice it. I think the Catholic Church's doctrine often conflicts with its practices, which can be quite outdated. They stick to their traditional ways even when they're no longer relevant.\n\nI don't think my personal views would necessarily change the situation, but personally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to get married. However, I'm not convinced that this would deter priests who engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a different issue altogether, and people who would do such things would probably do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIt's worth noting that people who abuse children tend to do so because of the power imbalance, not because of their marital status. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily stop these kinds of incidents from happening. It's unlikely that this would make a significant difference.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on this issue, and I'm not sure if there's a right or wrong side to take. What I do know is that this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with right now. The line between separating church and state is a delicate one, and defining marriage is a sensitive matter that can be tricky to navigate without offending anyone. \n\nI'm thinking that maybe we should look at all civil unions as just that – a union between two people, without the government looking into whether it was a religious or secular ceremony. I mean, if it's just about two people coming together, then why should the government care what kind of marriage it is? It's about the bond between the individuals, not about what the government thinks of it. \n\nThe thing is, if gay marriage is seen as just another type of civil union, then it shouldn't be a problem. It's all about two people coming together, and that's what counts. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it would be great if we could push for it to become federal law. But trying to ban gay marriage through a constitutional amendment is extreme – it's not the kind of thing that should be decided by amending the constitution.\n\nI just don't think it's worth altering the constitution for a cause that's not big enough. It's a serious issue for some people, but it's not something that should warrant changing the foundation of our country. It's just not that important to define and ban gay marriage by amending the constitution. Let's keep it simple – it's about two people coming together. \n\nI don't know, but that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, where things got a bit hazy when it came to homosexuality. Having lots of gay friends made me think a lot about this issue, and I didn't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, but I do think it should be legalized. I think it's crazy to make it a national issue, and instead, each state should have its own say. It's like, some states are super liberal and others are more conservative, so I don't think the president should impose their views on everyone. If you live in a state that's liberal, you know how they feel about it, and if you don't like it, maybe you shouldn't move there. I think everyone should have the same opportunities, so it should be up to each state to decide. I already kind of said that, but yeah. I don't think it's right that Bush can decide for the whole country that gay marriage is against the law. He shouldn't get to dictate how each state runs itself. I mean, he's not gonna be in office forever, and if a new president comes in and thinks differently, the ban will just be lifted and then put back on again. It's simpler to just let each state decide for themselves, since they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, let me start again. I don't agree with the idea that the school acted unreasonably. I was thinking about this, and it seems like the school's actions might have been justified. Myspace is a public platform, and anything posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. Even if the post wasn't made under the school's name, officials could still access it from their homes. If going through Myspace can prevent a school shooting, which is the school's responsibility, then I think it's perfectly fine.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to monitor student behavior, like whether they're drinking or smoking. They're doing it to catch students and get them in trouble, which I think is an invasion of privacy. However, if it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion at all. It's a bit like if they searched homes to prevent a school shooting; it's all about keeping students safe.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express myself when writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that posting on Myspace is a public thing, and students shouldn't be surprised if they get in trouble. I'm cautious about posting stuff online, even emails, because you never know who might see it. If you do something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the consequences. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials can see it because it's a public platform.\n\nIf you do something wrong in college and grow up to be an important person, an old email can still come back to haunt you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. It's not an invasion of privacy if the school officials are doing it to make the school safer. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that they have to ensure the school is safe, like during lockdowns and drills.\n\nIn this case, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, which is their responsibility. They were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. So, I think they acted reasonably. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the war and our involvement in it. To be honest, my initial reaction was to support it after 9/11, which had a huge impact on me personally. I thought we should take action and show them the same level of devastation they brought to us. However, over time, I've come to realize that we jumped into this without a clear plan or understanding of the long-term consequences. \n\nUnfortunately, I think that's exactly what led to our problems. When emotions are running high, we tend to overlook the bigger picture. We went in there unprepared, not knowing what to expect, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nTo be frank, I've lost interest in the whole situation. As long as the people over there are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to focus on fighting us. It's quite evident that we're not making a difference; they're too busy infighting to care about us. Sometimes it feels like they're not even human, the way they conduct war. It's savage and brutal, and I don't think they're fighting for the betterment of their country – they just want us out.\n\nI think we should've taken a step back and thought this through before getting involved. We were driven by a desire for revenge, and President Bush declared war on Iraq largely in response to public sentiment. At the time, I understood his position, but now I believe we could've handled it differently. We were too focused on the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and we didn't have a clear plan for what we wanted to achieve in Iraq. \n\nIf we had unified our goals and strategies, we might have avoided some of the chaos we're seeing today. But that wasn't the case, and now I think we're stuck in a situation that's not working for us. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the people of Iraq; they're too entrenched in their ways, and we'll never be able to bring about lasting change.\n\nAs it stands, I don't think we're making enough progress to justify our continued presence in Iraq. We've achieved some things, but not enough to justify the costs. Once we leave, the situation will likely collapse, and we'll just be hurting ourselves by staying any longer. It's time to reassess our involvement and consider pulling out. That's my two cents on the matter."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. I'm not saying they need a complete overhaul, but they do need to adapt to modern times. They're losing followers because they're not very accepting of certain things, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I get that they have strong views on these issues, but they're a bit outdated. If they were to update their stance, they might not be losing so many followers. \n\nIt's no secret that people are starting to drift away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these topics. Some individuals are even actively turning against the Church because it doesn't align with their own values. I think the Church is stuck in the past and needs to reconsider its stance on these issues. For instance, if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable with a Church that views it as morally wrong. The same goes for people who believe in gay marriage – they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't accept it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's hard to say whether this would've made a difference in the past, but it's definitely worth considering. The Church claims that priests are married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, most people with careers have both work and personal lives. It doesn't seem fair to expect priests to be any different. They should be able to have a family and devote themselves to both their faith and loved ones.",
            "Honestly, I don't have any major issues with gay marriage. I think the idea that people are born with their sexual orientation is a strong one. In my opinion, individuals shouldn't be held accountable for who they are naturally drawn to. It's not something that's consciously chosen, and I don't think it's right to hold that against them.\n\nI think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not just a matter of choice; people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. I mean, just like how I was born straight, others are born gay. They shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nI believe it's wrong for the government to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not a matter of law, but rather a matter of personal freedom. I don't think it's right to put people on a pedestal and say they made a wrong choice simply because of their orientation. It's not something they can help, and it's not something they should be ashamed of.\n\nTo me, the government's involvement in this issue seems out of place. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's about people's personal lives. They should be free to make their own choices, and the government shouldn't interfere with that. It's just who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The reasoning behind this is quite simple – there's no valid reason not to. Many people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is a misconception. Homosexuality and heterosexuality are two sides of the same coin, fundamentally different yet equal. It's pointless to try to draw parallels between the two, as they're distinct entities.\n\nOne of the main issues I see is that civil rights are often withheld from same-sex couples. For example, if a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're often barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital or making important medical decisions on their behalf. This is unfair, especially considering that these partners have made a commitment to spend their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It's ridiculous to argue that two people in love, regardless of their sexual orientation, can be treated as separate entities under the law.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that gay couples aren't asking to be married in a church; they're seeking a civil union recognized by the government. If a couple is allowed a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nMany people worry about issues like adoption and how same-sex couples will integrate into their communities. Some fear that children raised by gay parents will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or experience social stigma. However, these concerns are often based on misconceptions and a lack of understanding.\n\nFor instance, in New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and other challenges in public schools. It's heartbreaking to see parents protesting to have their child removed from their school simply because of their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a strong stance on this issue and make gay marriage legal across the board. The proposed amendment is misguided and ignores the moral complexities of the issue. It's hypocritical to allow laws that enforce one group's moral standards on an entire country, especially when there are ongoing debates about issues like the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage simply because they believe that being gay is a choice or a result of childhood trauma. However, this is a misconception that's been debunked by reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association. If we listened to research and facts rather than popular opinion, we might begin to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is banned doesn't mean it doesn't have some benefits. I'm not saying it should be available for everyone, not at all. But, for medical use, yeah, I think it's a different story. It's not beneficial just because it's illegal - that's my point.\n\nYeah, there are loads of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone or Vicodin. Those are used because they have benefits, right? So, if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of a stigma around it, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should accept its benefits and not be so quick to dismiss them.\n\nI don't think it's as similar to booze, actually, because if you overdo it on marijuana it can have problems, but if you overdo it on booze, that's a different story altogether. It's a tricky one, but I'd say we could integrate it slowly, make it legal gradually, not all at once, or it would get abused. But first, we need to get rid of the bad rep around marijuana. People think it's terrible, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we could change that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the modern age. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even as I look back on my childhood, I remember always attending church on Sundays, dressed up in cute little outfits. I'd wear matching dresses, shoes, and a purse, and it was a weekly tradition. Going to a private school only made it more fun, as I'd see my friends there. But over time, I've noticed the church has relaxed its rules. They now have a shorter mass, lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during the summer. You'd see families rushing in late, still in their beach clothes. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis - it's a more laid-back atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, this is the church I'm familiar with, but I don't know the inner workings or politics. However, it's definitely become more casual.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't believe allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these situations. There are married men who still have these tendencies, and it's not about whether they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice to become a priest, and some people might just be drawn to that path, regardless of the rules.\n\nEven in other faiths, like Seventh Day Adventism, there are reverends or ministers who are allowed to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion.\n\nWhen it comes to pedophilia, I think it's largely genetic. People are born with certain tendencies, and it's not something that's developed over time due to upbringing. It's possible that environment might play a small role, but I believe genetics are the main factor. Trying to change someone's sexuality through marriage wouldn't be effective, as it would likely reveal itself eventually. So, I don't think the church could have prevented these situations, even if they had made changes.\n\nIf there were cases where the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's a different issue altogether. However, I don't think that was the case in every situation. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "At first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seems to me that we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts, and the Bush administration used false connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks to justify the war. This really didn't sit well with me, as it's now clear that Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs, claims that were made at the time. \n\nI think the Bush administration has consistently lied to the American people, and to this day, they refuse to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I believe this is a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The administration has consistently disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11, at least. It's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. \n\nThe Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were suspect from the start. There were allegations made by a former treasury secretary that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and was also looking to expand the US's energy supply, which I think is a pretty underhanded way to go about it. \n\nI think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing troops now would be problematic. It's possible that the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more casualties. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia restoring order, doesn't necessarily sit well with me either. I worry that it would lead to more issues down the line, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is already ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to function. The Prime Minister has little control, and parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's, which holds 20 seats, are causing a lot of friction in the government. It's clear that the political process is experiencing a lot of tension due to these radical elements vying for power. \n\nTo be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the complexity of the situation. I don't have a clear solution to articulate in polite conversation.",
            "I'm having trouble articulating my thoughts on the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's all a bit confusing because it was never officially declared a war by Congress. It seems like it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, and we're still trying to build a democracy in Iraq, which is a daunting task that will likely take a long time. I'm not really sure why we're staying there, but it's partly because of oil and also because we want to help them create a stable government.\n\nHowever, it's clear that the whole situation is causing a lot of upset, and the longer we stay, the more complicated it gets. If we leave, the Iraqis might be angry with us for messing things up, but if we stay, we'll have to keep trying to impose our way of life on them, which could just make things worse. It's a tough situation, and I'm not sure what the best course of action is.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot, and I think we should be honest with ourselves about why we're really there. Is it because we're trying to help the Iraqis, or is it because we want to show off our military power? I'm not sure, and I think that's part of the problem. We shouldn't be calling it a war if it's not a declared one, and we shouldn't be using it as an excuse to flex our muscles.\n\nAt the same time, I feel for the families whose loved ones are over there fighting. I want to support them and want the war to be over so they can come home safely. But at the same time, I'm worried that we're just making things worse by staying there. We're disrupting their culture and way of life, and it's creating more problems than it's solving. It's like we're trying to force them to become a mini-version of the US, and that's not going to work.\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for years to come, and it's hard to know what the outcome will be. I'm just not sure what to think anymore, and it's all so complicated.",
            "Honestly, I have doubts about making something legal or having the government declare it as such. In my opinion, it's really up to the churches to decide because the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This is a fundamental principle that's already been written in stone, and trying to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of that. It seems like those pushing for it are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another.\n\nI think it's clear that most Catholics and Christians are against this, with some exceptions in certain areas. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, as that's not what the constitution is about. The separation of church and state has allowed for religious tolerance in the United States, and trying to change that with an amendment would be counterintuitive and contradictory. It's also worth noting that this amendment would likely be one of the only ones used to restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI strongly believe that the federal government should stay out of this issue, as I don't see a valid reason for the president's push for an amendment. It seems like his actions are driven by his own Catholic beliefs, which would give preference to that particular religion over others. The churches should be the ones deciding this, not the government, and there's no concrete evidence suggesting that an amendment is necessary. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society, rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've covered all my points on this.",
            "You might want to read the previous post before this one.  I'm feeling a bit clearer now about the US involvement in Iraq.  I think what's making it even more complicated is the way things went down.  We started the war just a month after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, and I'm not convinced that the government was entirely honest about the reasons behind the invasion.  I genuinely think they tried to tie the two events together, even though they weren't as connected as they seemed.  The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the very beginning, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.  It's like a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government not learning from its past mistakes.\n\nThink about it, a huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, and that's absolutely devastating.  The US was essentially removing the Iraqi government, but I'm not sure they were prepared for the chaos that would follow.  They wanted to establish a democratic government, just like in Vietnam, but that's not always a straightforward process.  I think the US government made it seem like it would be easy, but it's not that simple.  We're still in Iraq, and it's been years since the war started, with American troops still dying and trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their country - it's a long and difficult process.\n\nIn hindsight, I think the government was not fully prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and they might have even deceived the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful operation.  Implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not something that can be rushed or taken lightly, as we've seen in our own country's history.  It's not an easy thing to do, and I think the government made it seem like it was.\n\nThis was a major factor in my decision in the 2004 presidential election - I was torn between voting for George Bush, who had started the war, and the uncertainty of what would happen if we left Iraq.  It's a difficult decision, especially when we've been there for so long and taken away their government and way of life.  We can't just abandon them now, but at the same time, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify risking so many lives.\n\nThe reason we invaded Iraq in the first place was supposed to be to make it a democratic nation, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same in other countries?  I think the real reason is the oil issue - it's all about controlling resources and getting the oil.  Another factor was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out that was a false claim.  Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we know has those types of weapons, haven't been targeted.  It just seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it's hard to be optimistic about that right now.",
            "I'm gonna be honest, I think I'm in favor of gay marriage. To be honest, I've always been this way. I believe it's a personal preference, and what's more, science now shows it's not just a social influence, but actually has a biological basis. I don't think it's fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's just inhumane, in my opinion. As someone who's always been an advocate for gay marriage, I think the government should stay out of it. It's a personal matter, not a state or national issue. Look at my neighborhood, for example – there are openly gay couples living there, just like any other family. They do the same things everyone else does, like walking their dogs. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to decide what marriage means, and I think it's kind of laughable. I've read and heard from various sources that it's actually a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to. It's not just about how you grow up or your family dynamics. So, it's more about biology than social environment.\n\nTo be honest, the only real difference is that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, like in Las Vegas, without anyone knowing. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a big public deal, splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something the government or media gets involved in.",
            "You know, when you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's a public forum, after all. As an R.A., I've already had to deal with this kind of thing. Once something's online, it can shape people's opinions about you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like blowing things up or shootings, someone's bound to notice. You can't put that kind of thing out there, because it's going to be seen by everyone. The internet is a vast and open space, and if someone's friends with you on Myspace or Facebook, they're going to get that bulletin.\n\nIt's not like the school itself got wind of the bulletin - someone had to go to the school and report it. And then the school has to act on it, because they can't just ignore it in case something actually happens. It's a matter of preventing potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, because some people just mess around online. It could be like that silly experiment that went wrong in our sociology class, or it could be something really serious.\n\nWhat happened in our situation is that someone overheard someone saying something at school, and then they reported it. We found out who the person was, and when we looked through their Facebook, we found some stuff that made us worried. When you post things online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want something out there, don't put it online. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control that - you can't tell people what to take seriously or not.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea for school officials to be friends with students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's a legitimate concern, then it's not an invasion of privacy. I mean, I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I certainly don't want to have to deal with the consequences. That kind of relationship is just not necessary.",
            "Honestly, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which is a noble cause. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective over time. Now, I'm not convinced we're fighting for the right reasons - it's almost like we're doing it out of habit or to prove a point as a global superpower. Looking back, I'm not sure the motives were entirely pure, especially considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first couple of months when we started the war, which was a powerful statement in itself. But continuing it for over a year, or even several years, just feels like an overextension. If our aim was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a justifiable reason for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted and misconceived over time. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, and not wanting to leave without a clear victory.\n\nHonestly, I think it's time to bring this to an end. The government of the country we're fighting in should be able to fend for themselves now. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this conflict when we have our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need attention. It's a financial burden we can no longer afford, especially when that money could be better spent on internal improvements like public roads, education, and healthcare.\n\nWe've got our own problems to address at home, including poverty, healthcare, and education. It's disheartening to see money being spent on casualties in a foreign war that we've lost sight of our purpose for. I think it's time to reassess our priorities and end this war once and for all.",
            "To clarify, something was able to be prevented because someone found your profile online, right? It's because if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. On sites like Myspace, you have to let someone be your friend to see your profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it once you add them. So, anytime you put info online, you should understand that lots of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tough spot because, on the one hand, you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, it becomes unfair to single out certain people and make it their job to check up on everyone. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking around or were they actively searching for something specific?\n\nPersonality, I have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this one show that showed how easily someone could get info on a girl's profile, and it freaked me out. They got her screen name and started chatting with her in under a minute. I know some people in my classes who I don't know, but they know my screen name and where I am during the day. It's hard to know who can see what online, so I try to limit what I post, but I don't want to limit it too much since the whole point is to stay in touch with friends.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because you have to accept people as friends to see your profile, but you never know who can actually see what. I heard that some schools banned students from having Myspace profiles, and that seems a bit strange - I'm not sure how they had the right to do that.",
            "I'm starting to think about this more and it's making me realize how complex the situation with the Iraq War is. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it now, but I've come to the conclusion that it was a bad idea from the beginning. Looking back, it's clear that the general consensus was against it, except within the administration, where they didn't want to admit their mistake. Recent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops currently stationed there. It's astonishing to see such a high percentage of people against the war, both in the US and globally.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the start, and it's difficult to see a way out. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, and administrations have consistently failed to understand this. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region where it's not wanted is unrealistic. While Saddam was a bad leader, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The situation has been like quicksand since we entered, and I don't see any reason for us to stay.\n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I've yet to hear a valid reason. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's worth noting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to 'save' them, yet they're telling us to leave. If we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, it's not on us if things go wrong. If we do decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as the 'good guys,' even if it's a stretch.",
            "Okay, let's talk about this. I really believe that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, either - it's also a problem in certain fields. I think that women, in general, face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling\" that exists, even when it seems like there should be equality. This is because of the way society has been raised for so long, where men are often expected to be in charge.\n\nIn the workplace, women may have all the qualifications for a position, but they might be overlooked because it's not common for women to reach senior positions. This isn't just a women's issue, though - men can face similar challenges too. For example, in fields like fashion or parenting, it's unusual for men to be the primary caregiver, and they can be judged for it. People might think, \"You're a man, you should be working and providing for the family, not staying at home with the kids.\"\n\nIt's also an issue in the fashion industry, where people might not take men seriously if they're straight and interested in fashion. This is because men who enjoy fashion are often stereotyped as having a different lifestyle, and people might wonder if they really understand what fashion is all about.\n\nChanging this mindset is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. However, as more women rise to leadership positions and become accepted in the business world, things are starting to shift. Men are also becoming more accepted as stay-at-home dads, and people are beginning to realize that it's okay for men to take on this role.\n\nI think we need to promote the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but in a way that's not pushy. If we force it, people will resist. We're at a good point right now where things are starting to become more accepted, but we need to keep this momentum going. It's not just a matter of gender, either - people from different backgrounds or with different job skills can face prejudice too.\n\nFor example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Other men might look down on them, saying, \"How can I trust what you're saying if you can't even put together a simple sentence?\" It's not just about gender, but also about where you're from and how you speak.\n\nSo, yeah, that's my take on it. I don't think we're doing enough, but I'm not sure what more we can do at this point. We just need to keep moving forward, one step at a time.",
            "So, it seems that in some areas, marijuana isn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's more like a traffic ticket than a serious crime. This can have implications for things like job interviews, but the effects of a marijuana charge don't necessarily disappear even if it's decriminalized. For instance, when it comes to marijuana, one of the main concerns is the long-term consequences, which can be a real worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is a costly endeavor. It involves booking, housing, public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office, all of which add up. In financially struggling municipalities, some cities might be hesitant to make this change, even if it would free up funds for other important community projects.\n\nHowever, in places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, decriminalizing marijuana can be a great move, allowing the city to redirect funds towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's a complex issue with both financial and social implications.\n\nOne thing to consider is that if marijuana were fully legalized, it could lead to its increased presence in public spaces, which might be uncomfortable for some people. Additionally, it's worth noting that while marijuana's effects on motor skills are often compared to those of alcohol, it can also have a significant impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, people react differently to substances, and it's hard to generalize how they'll be affected.",
            "I'd definitely agree with you because many Catholic practices are steeped in tradition. For instance, they've been following the same customs for a long time. While it's great to be rooted in tradition, it's also essential to be open to change. A lot of Catholics attend church every week and have strict rules about how things should be done. Unfortunately, I think the Catholic Church can come across as judgmental towards people who don't adhere strictly to their doctrine. Moreover, they don't always welcome people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics. This was evident in my family's situation – my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. It's hard to see this as tolerance, especially when you consider that the Catholic Church teaches people to love others. It's hypocritical to say you love others but not accept them. I believe the Catholic Church's teachings often contradict their practices, which can be outdated. They stick to these outdated practices, even though they don't align with their teachings.\n\nI'm not sure if allowing priests to marry would necessarily make them less likely to engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a complex issue, and I don't think it would be a simple solution. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. Children are a different situation than spouses, and it's unlikely that marriage would prevent such behavior.\n\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily prevent these types of incidents from occurring. I think it's possible that these actions would still happen even if priests were allowed to marry. It's a complex issue that requires a deeper look.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I'm struggling to form an opinion. It's tough to say who's right or wrong in this situation. I do think, though, that this is one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. The line between church and state is already blurry, and defining marriage is a delicate matter that can easily offend someone. To be honest, I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed as solely a government-defined institution. Considering it's also a deeply personal and sacred commitment, it's hard to see it as just a civil union. I mean, if two people get married, it's about their union, not about the specific type of marriage they've chosen or the church they attend. So, I think it should be viewed as a civil union, rather than a marriage with government-recognized status. \n\nI also think it's worth noting that the fact that gay marriage is being debated is a bit puzzling. To me, two people in a relationship are entitled to a civil union, regardless of their sexual orientation. If all states can come to a mutually beneficial agreement, then it should be pushed forward as a federal law. However, making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems unnecessary and extreme. It's not a widespread issue that warrants a constitutional amendment. It's just not something significant enough to alter the constitution.\n\nHonestly, I don't think so.",
            "Honestly, I come from a Christian background, and to be honest, this has left me with some mixed feelings about homosexuality. On one hand, I have lots of gay friends, so it's not something I can just dismiss. While I don't personally agree with the way of life, I do think it should be a matter of personal freedom. I believe it's not the government's place to make this decision for everyone, but rather each state should be able to decide for itself.\n\nIt makes sense that in democratic states, there's a higher likelihood of support for gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it's hard to argue with the majority opinion. I think it's only fair that individuals are given the same rights as everyone else, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nAs for President Bush's stance on the issue, I don't think he should have the power to dictate the entire country's views on this. Just because he's in office doesn't mean he gets to decide how every state runs itself. Plus, his views will likely change soon anyway - he's only in office for a couple more years, and if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban on gay marriage, the decision will probably just flip-flop. It's really up to each state to decide what's best for its own citizens, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of that decision.",
            "So I'm trying to figure this out, but let's be real, Myspace is a public platform. If you post something on it, you have to accept that people will see it. That includes school officials, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. They can access it from home, and in my opinion, if it means preventing a school shooting and saving lives, that's perfectly fine. I think it's the school's responsibility to ensure the safety of its students.\n\nIf school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, it feels like an invasion of privacy. But if it leads to making the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. It's like when they do random checks to catch students doing something they shouldn't be doing, but that's a different story.\n\nI feel like posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble is unrealistic. Everything can be found online, and it can come back to haunt you. If you post something as a college student, it can follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nI'm not saying I think it's okay for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's a different story. It's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that's exactly why they monitor online activity.\n\nThey had to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the Columbine incident. They were just trying to prevent anything bad from happening. In this case, school officials were doing the same thing - making the school a safer place by preventing a potential school shooting. That's all I'm saying.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the whole thing. To be honest, I was initially all for it after 9/11 because it was a personal issue for me. I had strong feelings and wanted to do something, but now I'm not so sure. I think we rushed into it without thinking about the long-term consequences. We just kind of went in without a clear plan and, in my opinion, it backfired. Honestly, I was all for it at first, but my feelings have changed. I don't think we accomplished anything by being there. I think the people in that region are too busy fighting each other to focus on fighting us too. It's hard for me to care about what's going on over there because of how they seem to be handling things. It's almost like they're not even human in the way they go to war. They just can't seem to work together, and that's why I don't think we should be there.\n\nI think we went in unprepared and didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. War is a completely different experience for them than for us. They're not looking to improve their country; they're just trying to get rid of us. I think we should just leave and be done with it. We were initially driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, but I don't think we were thinking rationally about the potential consequences. We were more hyped up than focused on creating a solution.\n\nI understand why President Bush made the decision to declare war on Iraq at the time, but I'm not sure we had a choice. However, I do think we could have come up with a better plan and been more united in our goals. We didn't seem to know what we were doing or what we wanted to achieve, and that made things worse. I don't think we're the right people to change them; they've been that way for a long time, and it's not going to change overnight. I don't think we're making enough progress, and it's pointless to stay there any longer. Once we leave, I think it will just collapse, and we can't stay forever. I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying. That's my honest opinion."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. I'm not saying they need a complete overhaul, but they do need to adapt to modern times. They're losing followers because they're not very accepting of certain things, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I get that they have strong views on these issues, but they're a bit outdated. If they were to update their stance, they might not be losing so many followers. \n\nIt's no secret that people are starting to drift away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these topics. Some individuals are even actively turning against the Church because it doesn't align with their own values. I think the Church is stuck in the past and needs to reconsider its stance on these issues. For instance, if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable with a Church that views it as morally wrong. The same goes for people who believe in gay marriage – they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't accept it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's hard to say whether this would've made a difference in the past, but it's definitely worth considering. The Church claims that priests are married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, most people with careers have both work and personal lives. It doesn't seem fair to expect priests to be any different. They should be able to have a family and devote themselves to both their faith and loved ones.",
            "Honestly, I don't have any major issues with gay marriage. I think the idea that people are born with their sexual orientation is a strong one. In my opinion, individuals shouldn't be held accountable for who they are naturally drawn to. It's not something that's consciously chosen, and I don't think it's right to hold that against them.\n\nI think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not just a matter of choice; people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. I mean, just like how I was born straight, others are born gay. They shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nI believe it's wrong for the government to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not a matter of law, but rather a matter of personal freedom. I don't think it's right to put people on a pedestal and say they made a wrong choice simply because of their orientation. It's not something they can help, and it's not something they should be ashamed of.\n\nTo me, the government's involvement in this issue seems out of place. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's about people's personal lives. They should be free to make their own choices, and the government shouldn't interfere with that. It's just who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The reasoning behind this is quite simple – there's no valid reason not to. Many people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is a misconception. Homosexuality and heterosexuality are two sides of the same coin, fundamentally different yet equal. It's pointless to try to draw parallels between the two, as they're distinct entities.\n\nOne of the main issues I see is that civil rights are often withheld from same-sex couples. For example, if a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're often barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital or making important medical decisions on their behalf. This is unfair, especially considering that these partners have made a commitment to spend their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It's ridiculous to argue that two people in love, regardless of their sexual orientation, can be treated as separate entities under the law.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that gay couples aren't asking to be married in a church; they're seeking a civil union recognized by the government. If a couple is allowed a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nMany people worry about issues like adoption and how same-sex couples will integrate into their communities. Some fear that children raised by gay parents will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or experience social stigma. However, these concerns are often based on misconceptions and a lack of understanding.\n\nFor instance, in New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and other challenges in public schools. It's heartbreaking to see parents protesting to have their child removed from their school simply because of their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a strong stance on this issue and make gay marriage legal across the board. The proposed amendment is misguided and ignores the moral complexities of the issue. It's hypocritical to allow laws that enforce one group's moral standards on an entire country, especially when there are ongoing debates about issues like the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage simply because they believe that being gay is a choice or a result of childhood trauma. However, this is a misconception that's been debunked by reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association. If we listened to research and facts rather than popular opinion, we might begin to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is banned doesn't mean it doesn't have some benefits. I'm not saying it should be available for everyone, not at all. But, for medical use, yeah, I think it's a different story. It's not beneficial just because it's illegal - that's my point.\n\nYeah, there are loads of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone or Vicodin. Those are used because they have benefits, right? So, if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of a stigma around it, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should accept its benefits and not be so quick to dismiss them.\n\nI don't think it's as similar to booze, actually, because if you overdo it on marijuana it can have problems, but if you overdo it on booze, that's a different story altogether. It's a tricky one, but I'd say we could integrate it slowly, make it legal gradually, not all at once, or it would get abused. But first, we need to get rid of the bad rep around marijuana. People think it's terrible, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we could change that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the modern age. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even as I look back on my childhood, I remember always attending church on Sundays, dressed up in cute little outfits. I'd wear matching dresses, shoes, and a purse, and it was a weekly tradition. Going to a private school only made it more fun, as I'd see my friends there. But over time, I've noticed the church has relaxed its rules. They now have a shorter mass, lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during the summer. You'd see families rushing in late, still in their beach clothes. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis - it's a more laid-back atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, this is the church I'm familiar with, but I don't know the inner workings or politics. However, it's definitely become more casual.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't believe allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these situations. There are married men who still have these tendencies, and it's not about whether they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice to become a priest, and some people might just be drawn to that path, regardless of the rules.\n\nEven in other faiths, like Seventh Day Adventism, there are reverends or ministers who are allowed to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion.\n\nWhen it comes to pedophilia, I think it's largely genetic. People are born with certain tendencies, and it's not something that's developed over time due to upbringing. It's possible that environment might play a small role, but I believe genetics are the main factor. Trying to change someone's sexuality through marriage wouldn't be effective, as it would likely reveal itself eventually. So, I don't think the church could have prevented these situations, even if they had made changes.\n\nIf there were cases where the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's a different issue altogether. However, I don't think that was the case in every situation. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "At first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seems to me that we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts, and the Bush administration used false connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks to justify the war. This really didn't sit well with me, as it's now clear that Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs, claims that were made at the time. \n\nI think the Bush administration has consistently lied to the American people, and to this day, they refuse to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I believe this is a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The administration has consistently disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11, at least. It's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. \n\nThe Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were suspect from the start. There were allegations made by a former treasury secretary that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and was also looking to expand the US's energy supply, which I think is a pretty underhanded way to go about it. \n\nI think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing troops now would be problematic. It's possible that the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more casualties. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia restoring order, doesn't necessarily sit well with me either. I worry that it would lead to more issues down the line, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is already ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to function. The Prime Minister has little control, and parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's, which holds 20 seats, are causing a lot of friction in the government. It's clear that the political process is experiencing a lot of tension due to these radical elements vying for power. \n\nTo be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the complexity of the situation. I don't have a clear solution to articulate in polite conversation.",
            "I'm having trouble articulating my thoughts on the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's all a bit confusing because it was never officially declared a war by Congress. It seems like it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, and we're still trying to build a democracy in Iraq, which is a daunting task that will likely take a long time. I'm not really sure why we're staying there, but it's partly because of oil and also because we want to help them create a stable government.\n\nHowever, it's clear that the whole situation is causing a lot of upset, and the longer we stay, the more complicated it gets. If we leave, the Iraqis might be angry with us for messing things up, but if we stay, we'll have to keep trying to impose our way of life on them, which could just make things worse. It's a tough situation, and I'm not sure what the best course of action is.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot, and I think we should be honest with ourselves about why we're really there. Is it because we're trying to help the Iraqis, or is it because we want to show off our military power? I'm not sure, and I think that's part of the problem. We shouldn't be calling it a war if it's not a declared one, and we shouldn't be using it as an excuse to flex our muscles.\n\nAt the same time, I feel for the families whose loved ones are over there fighting. I want to support them and want the war to be over so they can come home safely. But at the same time, I'm worried that we're just making things worse by staying there. We're disrupting their culture and way of life, and it's creating more problems than it's solving. It's like we're trying to force them to become a mini-version of the US, and that's not going to work.\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for years to come, and it's hard to know what the outcome will be. I'm just not sure what to think anymore, and it's all so complicated.",
            "Honestly, I have doubts about making something legal or having the government declare it as such. In my opinion, it's really up to the churches to decide because the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This is a fundamental principle that's already been written in stone, and trying to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of that. It seems like those pushing for it are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another.\n\nI think it's clear that most Catholics and Christians are against this, with some exceptions in certain areas. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, as that's not what the constitution is about. The separation of church and state has allowed for religious tolerance in the United States, and trying to change that with an amendment would be counterintuitive and contradictory. It's also worth noting that this amendment would likely be one of the only ones used to restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI strongly believe that the federal government should stay out of this issue, as I don't see a valid reason for the president's push for an amendment. It seems like his actions are driven by his own Catholic beliefs, which would give preference to that particular religion over others. The churches should be the ones deciding this, not the government, and there's no concrete evidence suggesting that an amendment is necessary. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society, rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've covered all my points on this.",
            "You might want to read the previous post before this one.  I'm feeling a bit clearer now about the US involvement in Iraq.  I think what's making it even more complicated is the way things went down.  We started the war just a month after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, and I'm not convinced that the government was entirely honest about the reasons behind the invasion.  I genuinely think they tried to tie the two events together, even though they weren't as connected as they seemed.  The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the very beginning, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.  It's like a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government not learning from its past mistakes.\n\nThink about it, a huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, and that's absolutely devastating.  The US was essentially removing the Iraqi government, but I'm not sure they were prepared for the chaos that would follow.  They wanted to establish a democratic government, just like in Vietnam, but that's not always a straightforward process.  I think the US government made it seem like it would be easy, but it's not that simple.  We're still in Iraq, and it's been years since the war started, with American troops still dying and trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their country - it's a long and difficult process.\n\nIn hindsight, I think the government was not fully prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and they might have even deceived the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful operation.  Implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not something that can be rushed or taken lightly, as we've seen in our own country's history.  It's not an easy thing to do, and I think the government made it seem like it was.\n\nThis was a major factor in my decision in the 2004 presidential election - I was torn between voting for George Bush, who had started the war, and the uncertainty of what would happen if we left Iraq.  It's a difficult decision, especially when we've been there for so long and taken away their government and way of life.  We can't just abandon them now, but at the same time, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify risking so many lives.\n\nThe reason we invaded Iraq in the first place was supposed to be to make it a democratic nation, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same in other countries?  I think the real reason is the oil issue - it's all about controlling resources and getting the oil.  Another factor was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out that was a false claim.  Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we know has those types of weapons, haven't been targeted.  It just seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it's hard to be optimistic about that right now.",
            "I'm gonna be honest, I think I'm in favor of gay marriage. To be honest, I've always been this way. I believe it's a personal preference, and what's more, science now shows it's not just a social influence, but actually has a biological basis. I don't think it's fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's just inhumane, in my opinion. As someone who's always been an advocate for gay marriage, I think the government should stay out of it. It's a personal matter, not a state or national issue. Look at my neighborhood, for example – there are openly gay couples living there, just like any other family. They do the same things everyone else does, like walking their dogs. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to decide what marriage means, and I think it's kind of laughable. I've read and heard from various sources that it's actually a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to. It's not just about how you grow up or your family dynamics. So, it's more about biology than social environment.\n\nTo be honest, the only real difference is that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, like in Las Vegas, without anyone knowing. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a big public deal, splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something the government or media gets involved in.",
            "You know, when you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's a public forum, after all. As an R.A., I've already had to deal with this kind of thing. Once something's online, it can shape people's opinions about you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like blowing things up or shootings, someone's bound to notice. You can't put that kind of thing out there, because it's going to be seen by everyone. The internet is a vast and open space, and if someone's friends with you on Myspace or Facebook, they're going to get that bulletin.\n\nIt's not like the school itself got wind of the bulletin - someone had to go to the school and report it. And then the school has to act on it, because they can't just ignore it in case something actually happens. It's a matter of preventing potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, because some people just mess around online. It could be like that silly experiment that went wrong in our sociology class, or it could be something really serious.\n\nWhat happened in our situation is that someone overheard someone saying something at school, and then they reported it. We found out who the person was, and when we looked through their Facebook, we found some stuff that made us worried. When you post things online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want something out there, don't put it online. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control that - you can't tell people what to take seriously or not.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea for school officials to be friends with students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's a legitimate concern, then it's not an invasion of privacy. I mean, I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I certainly don't want to have to deal with the consequences. That kind of relationship is just not necessary.",
            "Honestly, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which is a noble cause. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective over time. Now, I'm not convinced we're fighting for the right reasons - it's almost like we're doing it out of habit or to prove a point as a global superpower. Looking back, I'm not sure the motives were entirely pure, especially considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first couple of months when we started the war, which was a powerful statement in itself. But continuing it for over a year, or even several years, just feels like an overextension. If our aim was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a justifiable reason for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted and misconceived over time. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, and not wanting to leave without a clear victory.\n\nHonestly, I think it's time to bring this to an end. The government of the country we're fighting in should be able to fend for themselves now. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this conflict when we have our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need attention. It's a financial burden we can no longer afford, especially when that money could be better spent on internal improvements like public roads, education, and healthcare.\n\nWe've got our own problems to address at home, including poverty, healthcare, and education. It's disheartening to see money being spent on casualties in a foreign war that we've lost sight of our purpose for. I think it's time to reassess our priorities and end this war once and for all.",
            "To clarify, something was able to be prevented because someone found your profile online, right? It's because if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. On sites like Myspace, you have to let someone be your friend to see your profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it once you add them. So, anytime you put info online, you should understand that lots of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tough spot because, on the one hand, you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, it becomes unfair to single out certain people and make it their job to check up on everyone. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking around or were they actively searching for something specific?\n\nPersonality, I have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this one show that showed how easily someone could get info on a girl's profile, and it freaked me out. They got her screen name and started chatting with her in under a minute. I know some people in my classes who I don't know, but they know my screen name and where I am during the day. It's hard to know who can see what online, so I try to limit what I post, but I don't want to limit it too much since the whole point is to stay in touch with friends.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because you have to accept people as friends to see your profile, but you never know who can actually see what. I heard that some schools banned students from having Myspace profiles, and that seems a bit strange - I'm not sure how they had the right to do that.",
            "I'm starting to think about this more and it's making me realize how complex the situation with the Iraq War is. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it now, but I've come to the conclusion that it was a bad idea from the beginning. Looking back, it's clear that the general consensus was against it, except within the administration, where they didn't want to admit their mistake. Recent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops currently stationed there. It's astonishing to see such a high percentage of people against the war, both in the US and globally.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the start, and it's difficult to see a way out. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, and administrations have consistently failed to understand this. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region where it's not wanted is unrealistic. While Saddam was a bad leader, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The situation has been like quicksand since we entered, and I don't see any reason for us to stay.\n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I've yet to hear a valid reason. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's worth noting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to 'save' them, yet they're telling us to leave. If we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, it's not on us if things go wrong. If we do decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as the 'good guys,' even if it's a stretch.",
            "Okay, let's talk about this. I really believe that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, either - it's also a problem in certain fields. I think that women, in general, face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling\" that exists, even when it seems like there should be equality. This is because of the way society has been raised for so long, where men are often expected to be in charge.\n\nIn the workplace, women may have all the qualifications for a position, but they might be overlooked because it's not common for women to reach senior positions. This isn't just a women's issue, though - men can face similar challenges too. For example, in fields like fashion or parenting, it's unusual for men to be the primary caregiver, and they can be judged for it. People might think, \"You're a man, you should be working and providing for the family, not staying at home with the kids.\"\n\nIt's also an issue in the fashion industry, where people might not take men seriously if they're straight and interested in fashion. This is because men who enjoy fashion are often stereotyped as having a different lifestyle, and people might wonder if they really understand what fashion is all about.\n\nChanging this mindset is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. However, as more women rise to leadership positions and become accepted in the business world, things are starting to shift. Men are also becoming more accepted as stay-at-home dads, and people are beginning to realize that it's okay for men to take on this role.\n\nI think we need to promote the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but in a way that's not pushy. If we force it, people will resist. We're at a good point right now where things are starting to become more accepted, but we need to keep this momentum going. It's not just a matter of gender, either - people from different backgrounds or with different job skills can face prejudice too.\n\nFor example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Other men might look down on them, saying, \"How can I trust what you're saying if you can't even put together a simple sentence?\" It's not just about gender, but also about where you're from and how you speak.\n\nSo, yeah, that's my take on it. I don't think we're doing enough, but I'm not sure what more we can do at this point. We just need to keep moving forward, one step at a time.",
            "So, it seems that in some areas, marijuana isn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's more like a traffic ticket than a serious crime. This can have implications for things like job interviews, but the effects of a marijuana charge don't necessarily disappear even if it's decriminalized. For instance, when it comes to marijuana, one of the main concerns is the long-term consequences, which can be a real worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is a costly endeavor. It involves booking, housing, public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office, all of which add up. In financially struggling municipalities, some cities might be hesitant to make this change, even if it would free up funds for other important community projects.\n\nHowever, in places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, decriminalizing marijuana can be a great move, allowing the city to redirect funds towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's a complex issue with both financial and social implications.\n\nOne thing to consider is that if marijuana were fully legalized, it could lead to its increased presence in public spaces, which might be uncomfortable for some people. Additionally, it's worth noting that while marijuana's effects on motor skills are often compared to those of alcohol, it can also have a significant impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, people react differently to substances, and it's hard to generalize how they'll be affected.",
            "I'd definitely agree with you because many Catholic practices are steeped in tradition. For instance, they've been following the same customs for a long time. While it's great to be rooted in tradition, it's also essential to be open to change. A lot of Catholics attend church every week and have strict rules about how things should be done. Unfortunately, I think the Catholic Church can come across as judgmental towards people who don't adhere strictly to their doctrine. Moreover, they don't always welcome people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics. This was evident in my family's situation – my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. It's hard to see this as tolerance, especially when you consider that the Catholic Church teaches people to love others. It's hypocritical to say you love others but not accept them. I believe the Catholic Church's teachings often contradict their practices, which can be outdated. They stick to these outdated practices, even though they don't align with their teachings.\n\nI'm not sure if allowing priests to marry would necessarily make them less likely to engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a complex issue, and I don't think it would be a simple solution. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. Children are a different situation than spouses, and it's unlikely that marriage would prevent such behavior.\n\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily prevent these types of incidents from occurring. I think it's possible that these actions would still happen even if priests were allowed to marry. It's a complex issue that requires a deeper look.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I'm struggling to form an opinion. It's tough to say who's right or wrong in this situation. I do think, though, that this is one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. The line between church and state is already blurry, and defining marriage is a delicate matter that can easily offend someone. To be honest, I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed as solely a government-defined institution. Considering it's also a deeply personal and sacred commitment, it's hard to see it as just a civil union. I mean, if two people get married, it's about their union, not about the specific type of marriage they've chosen or the church they attend. So, I think it should be viewed as a civil union, rather than a marriage with government-recognized status. \n\nI also think it's worth noting that the fact that gay marriage is being debated is a bit puzzling. To me, two people in a relationship are entitled to a civil union, regardless of their sexual orientation. If all states can come to a mutually beneficial agreement, then it should be pushed forward as a federal law. However, making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems unnecessary and extreme. It's not a widespread issue that warrants a constitutional amendment. It's just not something significant enough to alter the constitution.\n\nHonestly, I don't think so.",
            "Honestly, I come from a Christian background, and to be honest, this has left me with some mixed feelings about homosexuality. On one hand, I have lots of gay friends, so it's not something I can just dismiss. While I don't personally agree with the way of life, I do think it should be a matter of personal freedom. I believe it's not the government's place to make this decision for everyone, but rather each state should be able to decide for itself.\n\nIt makes sense that in democratic states, there's a higher likelihood of support for gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it's hard to argue with the majority opinion. I think it's only fair that individuals are given the same rights as everyone else, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nAs for President Bush's stance on the issue, I don't think he should have the power to dictate the entire country's views on this. Just because he's in office doesn't mean he gets to decide how every state runs itself. Plus, his views will likely change soon anyway - he's only in office for a couple more years, and if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban on gay marriage, the decision will probably just flip-flop. It's really up to each state to decide what's best for its own citizens, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of that decision.",
            "So I'm trying to figure this out, but let's be real, Myspace is a public platform. If you post something on it, you have to accept that people will see it. That includes school officials, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. They can access it from home, and in my opinion, if it means preventing a school shooting and saving lives, that's perfectly fine. I think it's the school's responsibility to ensure the safety of its students.\n\nIf school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, it feels like an invasion of privacy. But if it leads to making the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. It's like when they do random checks to catch students doing something they shouldn't be doing, but that's a different story.\n\nI feel like posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble is unrealistic. Everything can be found online, and it can come back to haunt you. If you post something as a college student, it can follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nI'm not saying I think it's okay for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's a different story. It's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that's exactly why they monitor online activity.\n\nThey had to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the Columbine incident. They were just trying to prevent anything bad from happening. In this case, school officials were doing the same thing - making the school a safer place by preventing a potential school shooting. That's all I'm saying.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the whole thing. To be honest, I was initially all for it after 9/11 because it was a personal issue for me. I had strong feelings and wanted to do something, but now I'm not so sure. I think we rushed into it without thinking about the long-term consequences. We just kind of went in without a clear plan and, in my opinion, it backfired. Honestly, I was all for it at first, but my feelings have changed. I don't think we accomplished anything by being there. I think the people in that region are too busy fighting each other to focus on fighting us too. It's hard for me to care about what's going on over there because of how they seem to be handling things. It's almost like they're not even human in the way they go to war. They just can't seem to work together, and that's why I don't think we should be there.\n\nI think we went in unprepared and didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. War is a completely different experience for them than for us. They're not looking to improve their country; they're just trying to get rid of us. I think we should just leave and be done with it. We were initially driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, but I don't think we were thinking rationally about the potential consequences. We were more hyped up than focused on creating a solution.\n\nI understand why President Bush made the decision to declare war on Iraq at the time, but I'm not sure we had a choice. However, I do think we could have come up with a better plan and been more united in our goals. We didn't seem to know what we were doing or what we wanted to achieve, and that made things worse. I don't think we're the right people to change them; they've been that way for a long time, and it's not going to change overnight. I don't think we're making enough progress, and it's pointless to stay there any longer. Once we leave, I think it will just collapse, and we can't stay forever. I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying. That's my honest opinion."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. I'm not saying they need a complete overhaul, but they do need to adapt to modern times. They're losing followers because they're not very accepting of certain things, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I get that they have strong views on these issues, but they're a bit outdated. If they were to update their stance, they might not be losing so many followers. \n\nIt's no secret that people are starting to drift away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these topics. Some individuals are even actively turning against the Church because it doesn't align with their own values. I think the Church is stuck in the past and needs to reconsider its stance on these issues. For instance, if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable with a Church that views it as morally wrong. The same goes for people who believe in gay marriage – they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't accept it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's hard to say whether this would've made a difference in the past, but it's definitely worth considering. The Church claims that priests are married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, most people with careers have both work and personal lives. It doesn't seem fair to expect priests to be any different. They should be able to have a family and devote themselves to both their faith and loved ones.",
            "Honestly, I don't have any major issues with gay marriage. I think the idea that people are born with their sexual orientation is a strong one. In my opinion, individuals shouldn't be held accountable for who they are naturally drawn to. It's not something that's consciously chosen, and I don't think it's right to hold that against them.\n\nI think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not just a matter of choice; people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. I mean, just like how I was born straight, others are born gay. They shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nI believe it's wrong for the government to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not a matter of law, but rather a matter of personal freedom. I don't think it's right to put people on a pedestal and say they made a wrong choice simply because of their orientation. It's not something they can help, and it's not something they should be ashamed of.\n\nTo me, the government's involvement in this issue seems out of place. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's about people's personal lives. They should be free to make their own choices, and the government shouldn't interfere with that. It's just who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The reasoning behind this is quite simple – there's no valid reason not to. Many people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is a misconception. Homosexuality and heterosexuality are two sides of the same coin, fundamentally different yet equal. It's pointless to try to draw parallels between the two, as they're distinct entities.\n\nOne of the main issues I see is that civil rights are often withheld from same-sex couples. For example, if a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're often barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital or making important medical decisions on their behalf. This is unfair, especially considering that these partners have made a commitment to spend their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It's ridiculous to argue that two people in love, regardless of their sexual orientation, can be treated as separate entities under the law.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that gay couples aren't asking to be married in a church; they're seeking a civil union recognized by the government. If a couple is allowed a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nMany people worry about issues like adoption and how same-sex couples will integrate into their communities. Some fear that children raised by gay parents will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or experience social stigma. However, these concerns are often based on misconceptions and a lack of understanding.\n\nFor instance, in New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and other challenges in public schools. It's heartbreaking to see parents protesting to have their child removed from their school simply because of their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a strong stance on this issue and make gay marriage legal across the board. The proposed amendment is misguided and ignores the moral complexities of the issue. It's hypocritical to allow laws that enforce one group's moral standards on an entire country, especially when there are ongoing debates about issues like the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage simply because they believe that being gay is a choice or a result of childhood trauma. However, this is a misconception that's been debunked by reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association. If we listened to research and facts rather than popular opinion, we might begin to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is banned doesn't mean it doesn't have some benefits. I'm not saying it should be available for everyone, not at all. But, for medical use, yeah, I think it's a different story. It's not beneficial just because it's illegal - that's my point.\n\nYeah, there are loads of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone or Vicodin. Those are used because they have benefits, right? So, if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of a stigma around it, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should accept its benefits and not be so quick to dismiss them.\n\nI don't think it's as similar to booze, actually, because if you overdo it on marijuana it can have problems, but if you overdo it on booze, that's a different story altogether. It's a tricky one, but I'd say we could integrate it slowly, make it legal gradually, not all at once, or it would get abused. But first, we need to get rid of the bad rep around marijuana. People think it's terrible, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we could change that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the modern age. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even as I look back on my childhood, I remember always attending church on Sundays, dressed up in cute little outfits. I'd wear matching dresses, shoes, and a purse, and it was a weekly tradition. Going to a private school only made it more fun, as I'd see my friends there. But over time, I've noticed the church has relaxed its rules. They now have a shorter mass, lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during the summer. You'd see families rushing in late, still in their beach clothes. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis - it's a more laid-back atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, this is the church I'm familiar with, but I don't know the inner workings or politics. However, it's definitely become more casual.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't believe allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these situations. There are married men who still have these tendencies, and it's not about whether they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice to become a priest, and some people might just be drawn to that path, regardless of the rules.\n\nEven in other faiths, like Seventh Day Adventism, there are reverends or ministers who are allowed to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion.\n\nWhen it comes to pedophilia, I think it's largely genetic. People are born with certain tendencies, and it's not something that's developed over time due to upbringing. It's possible that environment might play a small role, but I believe genetics are the main factor. Trying to change someone's sexuality through marriage wouldn't be effective, as it would likely reveal itself eventually. So, I don't think the church could have prevented these situations, even if they had made changes.\n\nIf there were cases where the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's a different issue altogether. However, I don't think that was the case in every situation. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "At first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seems to me that we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts, and the Bush administration used false connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks to justify the war. This really didn't sit well with me, as it's now clear that Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs, claims that were made at the time. \n\nI think the Bush administration has consistently lied to the American people, and to this day, they refuse to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I believe this is a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The administration has consistently disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11, at least. It's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. \n\nThe Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were suspect from the start. There were allegations made by a former treasury secretary that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and was also looking to expand the US's energy supply, which I think is a pretty underhanded way to go about it. \n\nI think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing troops now would be problematic. It's possible that the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more casualties. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia restoring order, doesn't necessarily sit well with me either. I worry that it would lead to more issues down the line, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is already ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to function. The Prime Minister has little control, and parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's, which holds 20 seats, are causing a lot of friction in the government. It's clear that the political process is experiencing a lot of tension due to these radical elements vying for power. \n\nTo be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the complexity of the situation. I don't have a clear solution to articulate in polite conversation.",
            "I'm having trouble articulating my thoughts on the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's all a bit confusing because it was never officially declared a war by Congress. It seems like it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, and we're still trying to build a democracy in Iraq, which is a daunting task that will likely take a long time. I'm not really sure why we're staying there, but it's partly because of oil and also because we want to help them create a stable government.\n\nHowever, it's clear that the whole situation is causing a lot of upset, and the longer we stay, the more complicated it gets. If we leave, the Iraqis might be angry with us for messing things up, but if we stay, we'll have to keep trying to impose our way of life on them, which could just make things worse. It's a tough situation, and I'm not sure what the best course of action is.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot, and I think we should be honest with ourselves about why we're really there. Is it because we're trying to help the Iraqis, or is it because we want to show off our military power? I'm not sure, and I think that's part of the problem. We shouldn't be calling it a war if it's not a declared one, and we shouldn't be using it as an excuse to flex our muscles.\n\nAt the same time, I feel for the families whose loved ones are over there fighting. I want to support them and want the war to be over so they can come home safely. But at the same time, I'm worried that we're just making things worse by staying there. We're disrupting their culture and way of life, and it's creating more problems than it's solving. It's like we're trying to force them to become a mini-version of the US, and that's not going to work.\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for years to come, and it's hard to know what the outcome will be. I'm just not sure what to think anymore, and it's all so complicated.",
            "Honestly, I have doubts about making something legal or having the government declare it as such. In my opinion, it's really up to the churches to decide because the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This is a fundamental principle that's already been written in stone, and trying to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of that. It seems like those pushing for it are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another.\n\nI think it's clear that most Catholics and Christians are against this, with some exceptions in certain areas. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, as that's not what the constitution is about. The separation of church and state has allowed for religious tolerance in the United States, and trying to change that with an amendment would be counterintuitive and contradictory. It's also worth noting that this amendment would likely be one of the only ones used to restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI strongly believe that the federal government should stay out of this issue, as I don't see a valid reason for the president's push for an amendment. It seems like his actions are driven by his own Catholic beliefs, which would give preference to that particular religion over others. The churches should be the ones deciding this, not the government, and there's no concrete evidence suggesting that an amendment is necessary. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society, rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've covered all my points on this.",
            "You might want to read the previous post before this one.  I'm feeling a bit clearer now about the US involvement in Iraq.  I think what's making it even more complicated is the way things went down.  We started the war just a month after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, and I'm not convinced that the government was entirely honest about the reasons behind the invasion.  I genuinely think they tried to tie the two events together, even though they weren't as connected as they seemed.  The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the very beginning, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.  It's like a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government not learning from its past mistakes.\n\nThink about it, a huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, and that's absolutely devastating.  The US was essentially removing the Iraqi government, but I'm not sure they were prepared for the chaos that would follow.  They wanted to establish a democratic government, just like in Vietnam, but that's not always a straightforward process.  I think the US government made it seem like it would be easy, but it's not that simple.  We're still in Iraq, and it's been years since the war started, with American troops still dying and trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their country - it's a long and difficult process.\n\nIn hindsight, I think the government was not fully prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and they might have even deceived the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful operation.  Implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not something that can be rushed or taken lightly, as we've seen in our own country's history.  It's not an easy thing to do, and I think the government made it seem like it was.\n\nThis was a major factor in my decision in the 2004 presidential election - I was torn between voting for George Bush, who had started the war, and the uncertainty of what would happen if we left Iraq.  It's a difficult decision, especially when we've been there for so long and taken away their government and way of life.  We can't just abandon them now, but at the same time, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify risking so many lives.\n\nThe reason we invaded Iraq in the first place was supposed to be to make it a democratic nation, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same in other countries?  I think the real reason is the oil issue - it's all about controlling resources and getting the oil.  Another factor was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out that was a false claim.  Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we know has those types of weapons, haven't been targeted.  It just seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it's hard to be optimistic about that right now.",
            "I'm gonna be honest, I think I'm in favor of gay marriage. To be honest, I've always been this way. I believe it's a personal preference, and what's more, science now shows it's not just a social influence, but actually has a biological basis. I don't think it's fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's just inhumane, in my opinion. As someone who's always been an advocate for gay marriage, I think the government should stay out of it. It's a personal matter, not a state or national issue. Look at my neighborhood, for example – there are openly gay couples living there, just like any other family. They do the same things everyone else does, like walking their dogs. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to decide what marriage means, and I think it's kind of laughable. I've read and heard from various sources that it's actually a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to. It's not just about how you grow up or your family dynamics. So, it's more about biology than social environment.\n\nTo be honest, the only real difference is that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, like in Las Vegas, without anyone knowing. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a big public deal, splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something the government or media gets involved in.",

And then the school has to act on it, because they can't just ignore it in case something actually happens. It's a matter of preventing potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, because some people just mess around online. It could be like that silly experiment that went wrong in our sociology class, or it could be something really serious.\n\nWhat happened in our situation is that someone overheard someone saying something at school, and then they reported it. We found out who the person was, and when we looked through their Facebook, we found some stuff that made us worried. When you post things online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want something out there, don't put it online. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control that - you can't tell people what to take seriously or not.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea for school officials to be friends with students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's a legitimate concern, then it's not an invasion of privacy. I mean, I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I certainly don't want to have to deal with the consequences. That kind of relationship is just not necessary.",
            "Honestly, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which is a noble cause. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective over time. Now, I'm not convinced we're fighting for the right reasons - it's almost like we're doing it out of habit or to prove a point as a global superpower. Looking back, I'm not sure the motives were entirely pure, especially considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first couple of months when we started the war, which was a powerful statement in itself. But continuing it for over a year, or even several years, just feels like an overextension. If our aim was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a justifiable reason for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted and misconceived over time. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, and not wanting to leave without a clear victory.\n\nHonestly, I think it's time to bring this to an end. The government of the country we're fighting in should be able to fend for themselves now. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this conflict when we have our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need attention. It's a financial burden we can no longer afford, especially when that money could be better spent on internal improvements like public roads, education, and healthcare.\n\nWe've got our own problems to address at home, including poverty, healthcare, and education. It's disheartening to see money being spent on casualties in a foreign war that we've lost sight of our purpose for. I think it's time to reassess our priorities and end this war once and for all.",
            "To clarify, something was able to be prevented because someone found your profile online, right? It's because if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. On sites like Myspace, you have to let someone be your friend to see your profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it once you add them. So, anytime you put info online, you should understand that lots of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tough spot because, on the one hand, you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, it becomes unfair to single out certain people and make it their job to check up on everyone. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking around or were they actively searching for something specific?\n\nPersonality, I have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this one show that showed how easily someone could get info on a girl's profile, and it freaked me out. They got her screen name and started chatting with her in under a minute. I know some people in my classes who I don't know, but they know my screen name and where I am during the day. It's hard to know who can see what online, so I try to limit what I post, but I don't want to limit it too much since the whole point is to stay in touch with friends.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because you have to accept people as friends to see your profile, but you never know who can actually see what. I heard that some schools banned students from having Myspace profiles, and that seems a bit strange - I'm not sure how they had the right to do that.",
            "I'm starting to think about this more and it's making me realize how complex the situation with the Iraq War is. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it now, but I've come to the conclusion that it was a bad idea from the beginning. Looking back, it's clear that the general consensus was against it, except within the administration, where they didn't want to admit their mistake. Recent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops currently stationed there. It's astonishing to see such a high percentage of people against the war, both in the US and globally.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the start, and it's difficult to see a way out. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, and administrations have consistently failed to understand this. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region where it's not wanted is unrealistic. While Saddam was a bad leader, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The situation has been like quicksand since we entered, and I don't see any reason for us to stay.\n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I've yet to hear a valid reason. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's worth noting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to 'save' them, yet they're telling us to leave. If we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, it's not on us if things go wrong. If we do decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as the 'good guys,' even if it's a stretch.",
            "Okay, let's talk about this. I really believe that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, either - it's also a problem in certain fields. I think that women, in general, face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling\" that exists, even when it seems like there should be equality. This is because of the way society has been raised for so long, where men are often expected to be in charge.\n\nIn the workplace, women may have all the qualifications for a position, but they might be overlooked because it's not common for women to reach senior positions. This isn't just a women's issue, though - men can face similar challenges too. For example, in fields like fashion or parenting, it's unusual for men to be the primary caregiver, and they can be judged for it. People might think, \"You're a man, you should be working and providing for the family, not staying at home with the kids.\"\n\nIt's also an issue in the fashion industry, where people might not take men seriously if they're straight and interested in fashion. This is because men who enjoy fashion are often stereotyped as having a different lifestyle, and people might wonder if they really understand what fashion is all about.\n\nChanging this mindset is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. However, as more women rise to leadership positions and become accepted in the business world, things are starting to shift. Men are also becoming more accepted as stay-at-home dads, and people are beginning to realize that it's okay for men to take on this role.\n\nI think we need to promote the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but in a way that's not pushy. If we force it, people will resist. We're at a good point right now where things are starting to become more accepted, but we need to keep this momentum going. It's not just a matter of gender, either - people from different backgrounds or with different job skills can face prejudice too.\n\nFor example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Other men might look down on them, saying, \"How can I trust what you're saying if you can't even put together a simple sentence?\" It's not just about gender, but also about where you're from and how you speak.\n\nSo, yeah, that's my take on it. I don't think we're doing enough, but I'm not sure what more we can do at this point. We just need to keep moving forward, one step at a time.",
            "So, it seems that in some areas, marijuana isn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's more like a traffic ticket than a serious crime. This can have implications for things like job interviews, but the effects of a marijuana charge don't necessarily disappear even if it's decriminalized. For instance, when it comes to marijuana, one of the main concerns is the long-term consequences, which can be a real worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is a costly endeavor. It involves booking, housing, public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office, all of which add up. In financially struggling municipalities, some cities might be hesitant to make this change, even if it would free up funds for other important community projects.\n\nHowever, in places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, decriminalizing marijuana can be a great move, allowing the city to redirect funds towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's a complex issue with both financial and social implications.\n\nOne thing to consider is that if marijuana were fully legalized, it could lead to its increased presence in public spaces, which might be uncomfortable for some people. Additionally, it's worth noting that while marijuana's effects on motor skills are often compared to those of alcohol, it can also have a significant impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, people react differently to substances, and it's hard to generalize how they'll be affected.",
            "I'd definitely agree with you because many Catholic practices are steeped in tradition. For instance, they've been following the same customs for a long time. While it's great to be rooted in tradition, it's also essential to be open to change. A lot of Catholics attend church every week and have strict rules about how things should be done. Unfortunately, I think the Catholic Church can come across as judgmental towards people who don't adhere strictly to their doctrine. Moreover, they don't always welcome people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics. This was evident in my family's situation – my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. It's hard to see this as tolerance, especially when you consider that the Catholic Church teaches people to love others. It's hypocritical to say you love others but not accept them. I believe the Catholic Church's teachings often contradict their practices, which can be outdated. They stick to these outdated practices, even though they don't align with their teachings.\n\nI'm not sure if allowing priests to marry would necessarily make them less likely to engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a complex issue, and I don't think it would be a simple solution. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. Children are a different situation than spouses, and it's unlikely that marriage would prevent such behavior.\n\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily prevent these types of incidents from occurring. I think it's possible that these actions would still happen even if priests were allowed to marry. It's a complex issue that requires a deeper look.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I'm struggling to form an opinion. It's tough to say who's right or wrong in this situation. I do think, though, that this is one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. The line between church and state is already blurry, and defining marriage is a delicate matter that can easily offend someone. To be honest, I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed as solely a government-defined institution. Considering it's also a deeply personal and sacred commitment, it's hard to see it as just a civil union. I mean, if two people get married, it's about their union, not about the specific type of marriage they've chosen or the church they attend. So, I think it should be viewed as a civil union, rather than a marriage with government-recognized status. \n\nI also think it's worth noting that the fact that gay marriage is being debated is a bit puzzling. To me, two people in a relationship are entitled to a civil union, regardless of their sexual orientation. If all states can come to a mutually beneficial agreement, then it should be pushed forward as a federal law. However, making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems unnecessary and extreme. It's not a widespread issue that warrants a constitutional amendment. It's just not something significant enough to alter the constitution.\n\nHonestly, I don't think so.",
            "Honestly, I come from a Christian background, and to be honest, this has left me with some mixed feelings about homosexuality. On one hand, I have lots of gay friends, so it's not something I can just dismiss. While I don't personally agree with the way of life, I do think it should be a matter of personal freedom. I believe it's not the government's place to make this decision for everyone, but rather each state should be able to decide for itself.\n\nIt makes sense that in democratic states, there's a higher likelihood of support for gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it's hard to argue with the majority opinion. I think it's only fair that individuals are given the same rights as everyone else, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nAs for President Bush's stance on the issue, I don't think he should have the power to dictate the entire country's views on this. Just because he's in office doesn't mean he gets to decide how every state runs itself. Plus, his views will likely change soon anyway - he's only in office for a couple more years, and if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban on gay marriage, the decision will probably just flip-flop. It's really up to each state to decide what's best for its own citizens, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of that decision.",
            "So I'm trying to figure this out, but let's be real, Myspace is a public platform. If you post something on it, you have to accept that people will see it. That includes school officials, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. They can access it from home, and in my opinion, if it means preventing a school shooting and saving lives, that's perfectly fine. I think it's the school's responsibility to ensure the safety of its students.\n\nIf school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, it feels like an invasion of privacy. But if it leads to making the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. It's like when they do random checks to catch students doing something they shouldn't be doing, but that's a different story.\n\nI feel like posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble is unrealistic. Everything can be found online, and it can come back to haunt you. If you post something as a college student, it can follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nI'm not saying I think it's okay for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's a different story. It's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that's exactly why they monitor online activity.\n\nThey had to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the Columbine incident. They were just trying to prevent anything bad from happening. In this case, school officials were doing the same thing - making the school a safer place by preventing a potential school shooting. That's all I'm saying.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the whole thing. To be honest, I was initially all for it after 9/11 because it was a personal issue for me. I had strong feelings and wanted to do something, but now I'm not so sure. I think we rushed into it without thinking about the long-term consequences. We just kind of went in without a clear plan and, in my opinion, it backfired. Honestly, I was all for it at first, but my feelings have changed. I don't think we accomplished anything by being there. I think the people in that region are too busy fighting each other to focus on fighting us too. It's hard for me to care about what's going on over there because of how they seem to be handling things. It's almost like they're not even human in the way they go to war. They just can't seem to work together, and that's why I don't think we should be there.\n\nI think we went in unprepared and didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. War is a completely different experience for them than for us. They're not looking to improve their country; they're just trying to get rid of us. I think we should just leave and be done with it. We were initially driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, but I don't think we were thinking rationally about the potential consequences. We were more hyped up than focused on creating a solution.\n\nI understand why President Bush made the decision to declare war on Iraq at the time, but I'm not sure we had a choice. However, I do think we could have come up with a better plan and been more united in our goals. We didn't seem to know what we were doing or what we wanted to achieve, and that made things worse. I don't think we're the right people to change them; they've been that way for a long time, and it's not going to change overnight. I don't think we're making enough progress, and it's pointless to stay there any longer. Once we leave, I think it will just collapse, and we can't stay forever. I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying. That's my honest opinion."
