            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. I'm not saying they need a complete overhaul, but they do need to adapt to modern times. They're losing followers because they're not very accepting of certain things, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I get that they have strong views on these issues, but they're a bit outdated. If they were to update their stance, they might not be losing so many followers. \n\nIt's no secret that people are starting to drift away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these topics. Some individuals are even actively turning against the Church because it doesn't align with their own values. I think the Church is stuck in the past and needs to reconsider its stance on these issues. For instance, if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable with a Church that views it as morally wrong. The same goes for people who believe in gay marriage – they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't accept it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's hard to say whether this would've made a difference in the past, but it's definitely worth considering. The Church claims that priests are married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, most people with careers have both work and personal lives. It doesn't seem fair to expect priests to be any different. They should be able to have a family and devote themselves to both their faith and loved ones.",
            "Honestly, I don't have any major issues with gay marriage. I think the idea that people are born with their sexual orientation is a strong one. In my opinion, individuals shouldn't be held accountable for who they are naturally drawn to. It's not something that's consciously chosen, and I don't think it's right to hold that against them.\n\nI think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not just a matter of choice; people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. I mean, just like how I was born straight, others are born gay. They shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nI believe it's wrong for the government to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not a matter of law, but rather a matter of personal freedom. I don't think it's right to put people on a pedestal and say they made a wrong choice simply because of their orientation. It's not something they can help, and it's not something they should be ashamed of.\n\nTo me, the government's involvement in this issue seems out of place. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's about people's personal lives. They should be free to make their own choices, and the government shouldn't interfere with that. It's just who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The reasoning behind this is quite simple – there's no valid reason not to. Many people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is a misconception. Homosexuality and heterosexuality are two sides of the same coin, fundamentally different yet equal. It's pointless to try to draw parallels between the two, as they're distinct entities.\n\nOne of the main issues I see is that civil rights are often withheld from same-sex couples. For example, if a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're often barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital or making important medical decisions on their behalf. This is unfair, especially considering that these partners have made a commitment to spend their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It's ridiculous to argue that two people in love, regardless of their sexual orientation, can be treated as separate entities under the law.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that gay couples aren't asking to be married in a church; they're seeking a civil union recognized by the government. If a couple is allowed a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nMany people worry about issues like adoption and how same-sex couples will integrate into their communities. Some fear that children raised by gay parents will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or experience social stigma. However, these concerns are often based on misconceptions and a lack of understanding.\n\nFor instance, in New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and other challenges in public schools. It's heartbreaking to see parents protesting to have their child removed from their school simply because of their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a strong stance on this issue and make gay marriage legal across the board. The proposed amendment is misguided and ignores the moral complexities of the issue. It's hypocritical to allow laws that enforce one group's moral standards on an entire country, especially when there are ongoing debates about issues like the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage simply because they believe that being gay is a choice or a result of childhood trauma. However, this is a misconception that's been debunked by reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association. If we listened to research and facts rather than popular opinion, we might begin to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is banned doesn't mean it doesn't have some benefits. I'm not saying it should be available for everyone, not at all. But, for medical use, yeah, I think it's a different story. It's not beneficial just because it's illegal - that's my point.\n\nYeah, there are loads of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone or Vicodin. Those are used because they have benefits, right? So, if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of a stigma around it, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should accept its benefits and not be so quick to dismiss them.\n\nI don't think it's as similar to booze, actually, because if you overdo it on marijuana it can have problems, but if you overdo it on booze, that's a different story altogether. It's a tricky one, but I'd say we could integrate it slowly, make it legal gradually, not all at once, or it would get abused. But first, we need to get rid of the bad rep around marijuana. People think it's terrible, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we could change that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the modern age. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even as I look back on my childhood, I remember always attending church on Sundays, dressed up in cute little outfits. I'd wear matching dresses, shoes, and a purse, and it was a weekly tradition. Going to a private school only made it more fun, as I'd see my friends there. But over time, I've noticed the church has relaxed its rules. They now have a shorter mass, lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during the summer. You'd see families rushing in late, still in their beach clothes. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis - it's a more laid-back atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, this is the church I'm familiar with, but I don't know the inner workings or politics. However, it's definitely become more casual.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't believe allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these situations. There are married men who still have these tendencies, and it's not about whether they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice to become a priest, and some people might just be drawn to that path, regardless of the rules.\n\nEven in other faiths, like Seventh Day Adventism, there are reverends or ministers who are allowed to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion.\n\nWhen it comes to pedophilia, I think it's largely genetic. People are born with certain tendencies, and it's not something that's developed over time due to upbringing. It's possible that environment might play a small role, but I believe genetics are the main factor. Trying to change someone's sexuality through marriage wouldn't be effective, as it would likely reveal itself eventually. So, I don't think the church could have prevented these situations, even if they had made changes.\n\nIf there were cases where the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's a different issue altogether. However, I don't think that was the case in every situation. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "At first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seems to me that we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts, and the Bush administration used false connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks to justify the war. This really didn't sit well with me, as it's now clear that Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs, claims that were made at the time. \n\nI think the Bush administration has consistently lied to the American people, and to this day, they refuse to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I believe this is a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The administration has consistently disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11, at least. It's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. \n\nThe Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were suspect from the start. There were allegations made by a former treasury secretary that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and was also looking to expand the US's energy supply, which I think is a pretty underhanded way to go about it. \n\nI think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing troops now would be problematic. It's possible that the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more casualties. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia restoring order, doesn't necessarily sit well with me either. I worry that it would lead to more issues down the line, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is already ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to function. The Prime Minister has little control, and parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's, which holds 20 seats, are causing a lot of friction in the government. It's clear that the political process is experiencing a lot of tension due to these radical elements vying for power. \n\nTo be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the complexity of the situation. I don't have a clear solution to articulate in polite conversation.",
            "I'm having trouble articulating my thoughts on the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's all a bit confusing because it was never officially declared a war by Congress. It seems like it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, and we're still trying to build a democracy in Iraq, which is a daunting task that will likely take a long time. I'm not really sure why we're staying there, but it's partly because of oil and also because we want to help them create a stable government.\n\nHowever, it's clear that the whole situation is causing a lot of upset, and the longer we stay, the more complicated it gets. If we leave, the Iraqis might be angry with us for messing things up, but if we stay, we'll have to keep trying to impose our way of life on them, which could just make things worse. It's a tough situation, and I'm not sure what the best course of action is.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot, and I think we should be honest with ourselves about why we're really there. Is it because we're trying to help the Iraqis, or is it because we want to show off our military power? I'm not sure, and I think that's part of the problem. We shouldn't be calling it a war if it's not a declared one, and we shouldn't be using it as an excuse to flex our muscles.\n\nAt the same time, I feel for the families whose loved ones are over there fighting. I want to support them and want the war to be over so they can come home safely. But at the same time, I'm worried that we're just making things worse by staying there. We're disrupting their culture and way of life, and it's creating more problems than it's solving. It's like we're trying to force them to become a mini-version of the US, and that's not going to work.\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for years to come, and it's hard to know what the outcome will be. I'm just not sure what to think anymore, and it's all so complicated.",
            "Honestly, I have doubts about making something legal or having the government declare it as such. In my opinion, it's really up to the churches to decide because the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This is a fundamental principle that's already been written in stone, and trying to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of that. It seems like those pushing for it are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another.\n\nI think it's clear that most Catholics and Christians are against this, with some exceptions in certain areas. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, as that's not what the constitution is about. The separation of church and state has allowed for religious tolerance in the United States, and trying to change that with an amendment would be counterintuitive and contradictory. It's also worth noting that this amendment would likely be one of the only ones used to restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI strongly believe that the federal government should stay out of this issue, as I don't see a valid reason for the president's push for an amendment. It seems like his actions are driven by his own Catholic beliefs, which would give preference to that particular religion over others. The churches should be the ones deciding this, not the government, and there's no concrete evidence suggesting that an amendment is necessary. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society, rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've covered all my points on this.",
            "You might want to read the previous post before this one.  I'm feeling a bit clearer now about the US involvement in Iraq.  I think what's making it even more complicated is the way things went down.  We started the war just a month after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, and I'm not convinced that the government was entirely honest about the reasons behind the invasion.  I genuinely think they tried to tie the two events together, even though they weren't as connected as they seemed.  The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the very beginning, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.  It's like a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government not learning from its past mistakes.\n\nThink about it, a huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, and that's absolutely devastating.  The US was essentially removing the Iraqi government, but I'm not sure they were prepared for the chaos that would follow.  They wanted to establish a democratic government, just like in Vietnam, but that's not always a straightforward process.  I think the US government made it seem like it would be easy, but it's not that simple.  We're still in Iraq, and it's been years since the war started, with American troops still dying and trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their country - it's a long and difficult process.\n\nIn hindsight, I think the government was not fully prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and they might have even deceived the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful operation.  Implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not something that can be rushed or taken lightly, as we've seen in our own country's history.  It's not an easy thing to do, and I think the government made it seem like it was.\n\nThis was a major factor in my decision in the 2004 presidential election - I was torn between voting for George Bush, who had started the war, and the uncertainty of what would happen if we left Iraq.  It's a difficult decision, especially when we've been there for so long and taken away their government and way of life.  We can't just abandon them now, but at the same time, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify risking so many lives.\n\nThe reason we invaded Iraq in the first place was supposed to be to make it a democratic nation, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same in other countries?  I think the real reason is the oil issue - it's all about controlling resources and getting the oil.  Another factor was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out that was a false claim.  Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we know has those types of weapons, haven't been targeted.  It just seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it's hard to be optimistic about that right now.",
            "I'm gonna be honest, I think I'm in favor of gay marriage. To be honest, I've always been this way. I believe it's a personal preference, and what's more, science now shows it's not just a social influence, but actually has a biological basis. I don't think it's fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's just inhumane, in my opinion. As someone who's always been an advocate for gay marriage, I think the government should stay out of it. It's a personal matter, not a state or national issue. Look at my neighborhood, for example – there are openly gay couples living there, just like any other family. They do the same things everyone else does, like walking their dogs. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to decide what marriage means, and I think it's kind of laughable. I've read and heard from various sources that it's actually a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to. It's not just about how you grow up or your family dynamics. So, it's more about biology than social environment.\n\nTo be honest, the only real difference is that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, like in Las Vegas, without anyone knowing. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a big public deal, splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something the government or media gets involved in.",
            "You know, when you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's a public forum, after all. As an R.A., I've already had to deal with this kind of thing. Once something's online, it can shape people's opinions about you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like blowing things up or shootings, someone's bound to notice. You can't put that kind of thing out there, because it's going to be seen by everyone. The internet is a vast and open space, and if someone's friends with you on Myspace or Facebook, they're going to get that bulletin.\n\nIt's not like the school itself got wind of the bulletin - someone had to go to the school and report it. And then the school has to act on it, because they can't just ignore it in case something actually happens. It's a matter of preventing potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, because some people just mess around online. It could be like that silly experiment that went wrong in our sociology class, or it could be something really serious.\n\nWhat happened in our situation is that someone overheard someone saying something at school, and then they reported it. We found out who the person was, and when we looked through their Facebook, we found some stuff that made us worried. When you post things online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want something out there, don't put it online. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control that - you can't tell people what to take seriously or not.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea for school officials to be friends with students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's a legitimate concern, then it's not an invasion of privacy. I mean, I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I certainly don't want to have to deal with the consequences. That kind of relationship is just not necessary.",
            "Honestly, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which is a noble cause. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective over time. Now, I'm not convinced we're fighting for the right reasons - it's almost like we're doing it out of habit or to prove a point as a global superpower. Looking back, I'm not sure the motives were entirely pure, especially considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first couple of months when we started the war, which was a powerful statement in itself. But continuing it for over a year, or even several years, just feels like an overextension. If our aim was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a justifiable reason for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted and misconceived over time. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, and not wanting to leave without a clear victory.\n\nHonestly, I think it's time to bring this to an end. The government of the country we're fighting in should be able to fend for themselves now. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this conflict when we have our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need attention. It's a financial burden we can no longer afford, especially when that money could be better spent on internal improvements like public roads, education, and healthcare.\n\nWe've got our own problems to address at home, including poverty, healthcare, and education. It's disheartening to see money being spent on casualties in a foreign war that we've lost sight of our purpose for. I think it's time to reassess our priorities and end this war once and for all.",
            "To clarify, something was able to be prevented because someone found your profile online, right? It's because if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. On sites like Myspace, you have to let someone be your friend to see your profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it once you add them. So, anytime you put info online, you should understand that lots of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tough spot because, on the one hand, you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, it becomes unfair to single out certain people and make it their job to check up on everyone. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking around or were they actively searching for something specific?\n\nPersonality, I have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this one show that showed how easily someone could get info on a girl's profile, and it freaked me out. They got her screen name and started chatting with her in under a minute. I know some people in my classes who I don't know, but they know my screen name and where I am during the day. It's hard to know who can see what online, so I try to limit what I post, but I don't want to limit it too much since the whole point is to stay in touch with friends.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because you have to accept people as friends to see your profile, but you never know who can actually see what. I heard that some schools banned students from having Myspace profiles, and that seems a bit strange - I'm not sure how they had the right to do that.",
            "I'm starting to think about this more and it's making me realize how complex the situation with the Iraq War is. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it now, but I've come to the conclusion that it was a bad idea from the beginning. Looking back, it's clear that the general consensus was against it, except within the administration, where they didn't want to admit their mistake. Recent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops currently stationed there. It's astonishing to see such a high percentage of people against the war, both in the US and globally.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the start, and it's difficult to see a way out. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, and administrations have consistently failed to understand this. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region where it's not wanted is unrealistic. While Saddam was a bad leader, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The situation has been like quicksand since we entered, and I don't see any reason for us to stay.\n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I've yet to hear a valid reason. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's worth noting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to 'save' them, yet they're telling us to leave. If we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, it's not on us if things go wrong. If we do decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as the 'good guys,' even if it's a stretch.",
            "Okay, let's talk about this. I really believe that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, either - it's also a problem in certain fields. I think that women, in general, face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling\" that exists, even when it seems like there should be equality. This is because of the way society has been raised for so long, where men are often expected to be in charge.\n\nIn the workplace, women may have all the qualifications for a position, but they might be overlooked because it's not common for women to reach senior positions. This isn't just a women's issue, though - men can face similar challenges too. For example, in fields like fashion or parenting, it's unusual for men to be the primary caregiver, and they can be judged for it. People might think, \"You're a man, you should be working and providing for the family, not staying at home with the kids.\"\n\nIt's also an issue in the fashion industry, where people might not take men seriously if they're straight and interested in fashion. This is because men who enjoy fashion are often stereotyped as having a different lifestyle, and people might wonder if they really understand what fashion is all about.\n\nChanging this mindset is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. However, as more women rise to leadership positions and become accepted in the business world, things are starting to shift. Men are also becoming more accepted as stay-at-home dads, and people are beginning to realize that it's okay for men to take on this role.\n\nI think we need to promote the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but in a way that's not pushy. If we force it, people will resist. We're at a good point right now where things are starting to become more accepted, but we need to keep this momentum going. It's not just a matter of gender, either - people from different backgrounds or with different job skills can face prejudice too.\n\nFor example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Other men might look down on them, saying, \"How can I trust what you're saying if you can't even put together a simple sentence?\" It's not just about gender, but also about where you're from and how you speak.\n\nSo, yeah, that's my take on it. I don't think we're doing enough, but I'm not sure what more we can do at this point. We just need to keep moving forward, one step at a time.",
            "So, it seems that in some areas, marijuana isn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's more like a traffic ticket than a serious crime. This can have implications for things like job interviews, but the effects of a marijuana charge don't necessarily disappear even if it's decriminalized. For instance, when it comes to marijuana, one of the main concerns is the long-term consequences, which can be a real worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is a costly endeavor. It involves booking, housing, public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office, all of which add up. In financially struggling municipalities, some cities might be hesitant to make this change, even if it would free up funds for other important community projects.\n\nHowever, in places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, decriminalizing marijuana can be a great move, allowing the city to redirect funds towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's a complex issue with both financial and social implications.\n\nOne thing to consider is that if marijuana were fully legalized, it could lead to its increased presence in public spaces, which might be uncomfortable for some people. Additionally, it's worth noting that while marijuana's effects on motor skills are often compared to those of alcohol, it can also have a significant impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, people react differently to substances, and it's hard to generalize how they'll be affected.",
            "I'd definitely agree with you because many Catholic practices are steeped in tradition. For instance, they've been following the same customs for a long time. While it's great to be rooted in tradition, it's also essential to be open to change. A lot of Catholics attend church every week and have strict rules about how things should be done. Unfortunately, I think the Catholic Church can come across as judgmental towards people who don't adhere strictly to their doctrine. Moreover, they don't always welcome people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics. This was evident in my family's situation – my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. It's hard to see this as tolerance, especially when you consider that the Catholic Church teaches people to love others. It's hypocritical to say you love others but not accept them. I believe the Catholic Church's teachings often contradict their practices, which can be outdated. They stick to these outdated practices, even though they don't align with their teachings.\n\nI'm not sure if allowing priests to marry would necessarily make them less likely to engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a complex issue, and I don't think it would be a simple solution. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. Children are a different situation than spouses, and it's unlikely that marriage would prevent such behavior.\n\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily prevent these types of incidents from occurring. I think it's possible that these actions would still happen even if priests were allowed to marry. It's a complex issue that requires a deeper look.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I'm struggling to form an opinion. It's tough to say who's right or wrong in this situation. I do think, though, that this is one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. The line between church and state is already blurry, and defining marriage is a delicate matter that can easily offend someone. To be honest, I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed as solely a government-defined institution. Considering it's also a deeply personal and sacred commitment, it's hard to see it as just a civil union. I mean, if two people get married, it's about their union, not about the specific type of marriage they've chosen or the church they attend. So, I think it should be viewed as a civil union, rather than a marriage with government-recognized status. \n\nI also think it's worth noting that the fact that gay marriage is being debated is a bit puzzling. To me, two people in a relationship are entitled to a civil union, regardless of their sexual orientation. If all states can come to a mutually beneficial agreement, then it should be pushed forward as a federal law. However, making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems unnecessary and extreme. It's not a widespread issue that warrants a constitutional amendment. It's just not something significant enough to alter the constitution.\n\nHonestly, I don't think so.",
            "Honestly, I come from a Christian background, and to be honest, this has left me with some mixed feelings about homosexuality. On one hand, I have lots of gay friends, so it's not something I can just dismiss. While I don't personally agree with the way of life, I do think it should be a matter of personal freedom. I believe it's not the government's place to make this decision for everyone, but rather each state should be able to decide for itself.\n\nIt makes sense that in democratic states, there's a higher likelihood of support for gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it's hard to argue with the majority opinion. I think it's only fair that individuals are given the same rights as everyone else, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nAs for President Bush's stance on the issue, I don't think he should have the power to dictate the entire country's views on this. Just because he's in office doesn't mean he gets to decide how every state runs itself. Plus, his views will likely change soon anyway - he's only in office for a couple more years, and if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban on gay marriage, the decision will probably just flip-flop. It's really up to each state to decide what's best for its own citizens, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of that decision.",
            "So I'm trying to figure this out, but let's be real, Myspace is a public platform. If you post something on it, you have to accept that people will see it. That includes school officials, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. They can access it from home, and in my opinion, if it means preventing a school shooting and saving lives, that's perfectly fine. I think it's the school's responsibility to ensure the safety of its students.\n\nIf school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, it feels like an invasion of privacy. But if it leads to making the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. It's like when they do random checks to catch students doing something they shouldn't be doing, but that's a different story.\n\nI feel like posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble is unrealistic. Everything can be found online, and it can come back to haunt you. If you post something as a college student, it can follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nI'm not saying I think it's okay for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's a different story. It's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that's exactly why they monitor online activity.\n\nThey had to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the Columbine incident. They were just trying to prevent anything bad from happening. In this case, school officials were doing the same thing - making the school a safer place by preventing a potential school shooting. That's all I'm saying.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the whole thing. To be honest, I was initially all for it after 9/11 because it was a personal issue for me. I had strong feelings and wanted to do something, but now I'm not so sure. I think we rushed into it without thinking about the long-term consequences. We just kind of went in without a clear plan and, in my opinion, it backfired. Honestly, I was all for it at first, but my feelings have changed. I don't think we accomplished anything by being there. I think the people in that region are too busy fighting each other to focus on fighting us too. It's hard for me to care about what's going on over there because of how they seem to be handling things. It's almost like they're not even human in the way they go to war. They just can't seem to work together, and that's why I don't think we should be there.\n\nI think we went in unprepared and didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. War is a completely different experience for them than for us. They're not looking to improve their country; they're just trying to get rid of us. I think we should just leave and be done with it. We were initially driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, but I don't think we were thinking rationally about the potential consequences. We were more hyped up than focused on creating a solution.\n\nI understand why President Bush made the decision to declare war on Iraq at the time, but I'm not sure we had a choice. However, I do think we could have come up with a better plan and been more united in our goals. We didn't seem to know what we were doing or what we wanted to achieve, and that made things worse. I don't think we're the right people to change them; they've been that way for a long time, and it's not going to change overnight. I don't think we're making enough progress, and it's pointless to stay there any longer. Once we leave, I think it will just collapse, and we can't stay forever. I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying. That's my honest opinion."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. I'm not saying they need a complete overhaul, but they do need to adapt to modern times. They're losing followers because they're not very accepting of certain things, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I get that they have strong views on these issues, but they're a bit outdated. If they were to update their stance, they might not be losing so many followers. \n\nIt's no secret that people are starting to drift away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these topics. Some individuals are even actively turning against the Church because it doesn't align with their own values. I think the Church is stuck in the past and needs to reconsider its stance on these issues. For instance, if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable with a Church that views it as morally wrong. The same goes for people who believe in gay marriage – they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't accept it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's hard to say whether this would've made a difference in the past, but it's definitely worth considering. The Church claims that priests are married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, most people with careers have both work and personal lives. It doesn't seem fair to expect priests to be any different. They should be able to have a family and devote themselves to both their faith and loved ones.",
            "Honestly, I don't have any major issues with gay marriage. I think the idea that people are born with their sexual orientation is a strong one. In my opinion, individuals shouldn't be held accountable for who they are naturally drawn to. It's not something that's consciously chosen, and I don't think it's right to hold that against them.\n\nI think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not just a matter of choice; people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. I mean, just like how I was born straight, others are born gay. They shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nI believe it's wrong for the government to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not a matter of law, but rather a matter of personal freedom. I don't think it's right to put people on a pedestal and say they made a wrong choice simply because of their orientation. It's not something they can help, and it's not something they should be ashamed of.\n\nTo me, the government's involvement in this issue seems out of place. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's about people's personal lives. They should be free to make their own choices, and the government shouldn't interfere with that. It's just who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The reasoning behind this is quite simple – there's no valid reason not to. Many people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is a misconception. Homosexuality and heterosexuality are two sides of the same coin, fundamentally different yet equal. It's pointless to try to draw parallels between the two, as they're distinct entities.\n\nOne of the main issues I see is that civil rights are often withheld from same-sex couples. For example, if a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're often barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital or making important medical decisions on their behalf. This is unfair, especially considering that these partners have made a commitment to spend their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It's ridiculous to argue that two people in love, regardless of their sexual orientation, can be treated as separate entities under the law.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that gay couples aren't asking to be married in a church; they're seeking a civil union recognized by the government. If a couple is allowed a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nMany people worry about issues like adoption and how same-sex couples will integrate into their communities. Some fear that children raised by gay parents will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or experience social stigma. However, these concerns are often based on misconceptions and a lack of understanding.\n\nFor instance, in New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and other challenges in public schools. It's heartbreaking to see parents protesting to have their child removed from their school simply because of their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a strong stance on this issue and make gay marriage legal across the board. The proposed amendment is misguided and ignores the moral complexities of the issue. It's hypocritical to allow laws that enforce one group's moral standards on an entire country, especially when there are ongoing debates about issues like the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage simply because they believe that being gay is a choice or a result of childhood trauma. However, this is a misconception that's been debunked by reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association. If we listened to research and facts rather than popular opinion, we might begin to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is banned doesn't mean it doesn't have some benefits. I'm not saying it should be available for everyone, not at all. But, for medical use, yeah, I think it's a different story. It's not beneficial just because it's illegal - that's my point.\n\nYeah, there are loads of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone or Vicodin. Those are used because they have benefits, right? So, if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of a stigma around it, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should accept its benefits and not be so quick to dismiss them.\n\nI don't think it's as similar to booze, actually, because if you overdo it on marijuana it can have problems, but if you overdo it on booze, that's a different story altogether. It's a tricky one, but I'd say we could integrate it slowly, make it legal gradually, not all at once, or it would get abused. But first, we need to get rid of the bad rep around marijuana. People think it's terrible, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we could change that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the modern age. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even as I look back on my childhood, I remember always attending church on Sundays, dressed up in cute little outfits. I'd wear matching dresses, shoes, and a purse, and it was a weekly tradition. Going to a private school only made it more fun, as I'd see my friends there. But over time, I've noticed the church has relaxed its rules. They now have a shorter mass, lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during the summer. You'd see families rushing in late, still in their beach clothes. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis - it's a more laid-back atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, this is the church I'm familiar with, but I don't know the inner workings or politics. However, it's definitely become more casual.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't believe allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these situations. There are married men who still have these tendencies, and it's not about whether they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice to become a priest, and some people might just be drawn to that path, regardless of the rules.\n\nEven in other faiths, like Seventh Day Adventism, there are reverends or ministers who are allowed to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion.\n\nWhen it comes to pedophilia, I think it's largely genetic. People are born with certain tendencies, and it's not something that's developed over time due to upbringing. It's possible that environment might play a small role, but I believe genetics are the main factor. Trying to change someone's sexuality through marriage wouldn't be effective, as it would likely reveal itself eventually. So, I don't think the church could have prevented these situations, even if they had made changes.\n\nIf there were cases where the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's a different issue altogether. However, I don't think that was the case in every situation. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "At first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seems to me that we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts, and the Bush administration used false connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks to justify the war. This really didn't sit well with me, as it's now clear that Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs, claims that were made at the time. \n\nI think the Bush administration has consistently lied to the American people, and to this day, they refuse to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I believe this is a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The administration has consistently disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11, at least. It's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. \n\nThe Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were suspect from the start. There were allegations made by a former treasury secretary that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and was also looking to expand the US's energy supply, which I think is a pretty underhanded way to go about it. \n\nI think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing troops now would be problematic. It's possible that the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more casualties. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia restoring order, doesn't necessarily sit well with me either. I worry that it would lead to more issues down the line, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is already ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to function. The Prime Minister has little control, and parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's, which holds 20 seats, are causing a lot of friction in the government. It's clear that the political process is experiencing a lot of tension due to these radical elements vying for power. \n\nTo be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the complexity of the situation. I don't have a clear solution to articulate in polite conversation.",
            "I'm having trouble articulating my thoughts on the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's all a bit confusing because it was never officially declared a war by Congress. It seems like it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, and we're still trying to build a democracy in Iraq, which is a daunting task that will likely take a long time. I'm not really sure why we're staying there, but it's partly because of oil and also because we want to help them create a stable government.\n\nHowever, it's clear that the whole situation is causing a lot of upset, and the longer we stay, the more complicated it gets. If we leave, the Iraqis might be angry with us for messing things up, but if we stay, we'll have to keep trying to impose our way of life on them, which could just make things worse. It's a tough situation, and I'm not sure what the best course of action is.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot, and I think we should be honest with ourselves about why we're really there. Is it because we're trying to help the Iraqis, or is it because we want to show off our military power? I'm not sure, and I think that's part of the problem. We shouldn't be calling it a war if it's not a declared one, and we shouldn't be using it as an excuse to flex our muscles.\n\nAt the same time, I feel for the families whose loved ones are over there fighting. I want to support them and want the war to be over so they can come home safely. But at the same time, I'm worried that we're just making things worse by staying there. We're disrupting their culture and way of life, and it's creating more problems than it's solving. It's like we're trying to force them to become a mini-version of the US, and that's not going to work.\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for years to come, and it's hard to know what the outcome will be. I'm just not sure what to think anymore, and it's all so complicated.",
            "Honestly, I have doubts about making something legal or having the government declare it as such. In my opinion, it's really up to the churches to decide because the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This is a fundamental principle that's already been written in stone, and trying to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of that. It seems like those pushing for it are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another.\n\nI think it's clear that most Catholics and Christians are against this, with some exceptions in certain areas. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, as that's not what the constitution is about. The separation of church and state has allowed for religious tolerance in the United States, and trying to change that with an amendment would be counterintuitive and contradictory. It's also worth noting that this amendment would likely be one of the only ones used to restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI strongly believe that the federal government should stay out of this issue, as I don't see a valid reason for the president's push for an amendment. It seems like his actions are driven by his own Catholic beliefs, which would give preference to that particular religion over others. The churches should be the ones deciding this, not the government, and there's no concrete evidence suggesting that an amendment is necessary. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society, rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've covered all my points on this.",
            "You might want to read the previous post before this one.  I'm feeling a bit clearer now about the US involvement in Iraq.  I think what's making it even more complicated is the way things went down.  We started the war just a month after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, and I'm not convinced that the government was entirely honest about the reasons behind the invasion.  I genuinely think they tried to tie the two events together, even though they weren't as connected as they seemed.  The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the very beginning, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.  It's like a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government not learning from its past mistakes.\n\nThink about it, a huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, and that's absolutely devastating.  The US was essentially removing the Iraqi government, but I'm not sure they were prepared for the chaos that would follow.  They wanted to establish a democratic government, just like in Vietnam, but that's not always a straightforward process.  I think the US government made it seem like it would be easy, but it's not that simple.  We're still in Iraq, and it's been years since the war started, with American troops still dying and trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their country - it's a long and difficult process.\n\nIn hindsight, I think the government was not fully prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and they might have even deceived the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful operation.  Implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not something that can be rushed or taken lightly, as we've seen in our own country's history.  It's not an easy thing to do, and I think the government made it seem like it was.\n\nThis was a major factor in my decision in the 2004 presidential election - I was torn between voting for George Bush, who had started the war, and the uncertainty of what would happen if we left Iraq.  It's a difficult decision, especially when we've been there for so long and taken away their government and way of life.  We can't just abandon them now, but at the same time, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify risking so many lives.\n\nThe reason we invaded Iraq in the first place was supposed to be to make it a democratic nation, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same in other countries?  I think the real reason is the oil issue - it's all about controlling resources and getting the oil.  Another factor was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out that was a false claim.  Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we know has those types of weapons, haven't been targeted.  It just seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it's hard to be optimistic about that right now.",
            "I'm gonna be honest, I think I'm in favor of gay marriage. To be honest, I've always been this way. I believe it's a personal preference, and what's more, science now shows it's not just a social influence, but actually has a biological basis. I don't think it's fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's just inhumane, in my opinion. As someone who's always been an advocate for gay marriage, I think the government should stay out of it. It's a personal matter, not a state or national issue. Look at my neighborhood, for example – there are openly gay couples living there, just like any other family. They do the same things everyone else does, like walking their dogs. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to decide what marriage means, and I think it's kind of laughable. I've read and heard from various sources that it's actually a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to. It's not just about how you grow up or your family dynamics. So, it's more about biology than social environment.\n\nTo be honest, the only real difference is that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, like in Las Vegas, without anyone knowing. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a big public deal, splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something the government or media gets involved in.",
            "You know, when you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's a public forum, after all. As an R.A., I've already had to deal with this kind of thing. Once something's online, it can shape people's opinions about you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like blowing things up or shootings, someone's bound to notice. You can't put that kind of thing out there, because it's going to be seen by everyone. The internet is a vast and open space, and if someone's friends with you on Myspace or Facebook, they're going to get that bulletin.\n\nIt's not like the school itself got wind of the bulletin - someone had to go to the school and report it. And then the school has to act on it, because they can't just ignore it in case something actually happens. It's a matter of preventing potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, because some people just mess around online. It could be like that silly experiment that went wrong in our sociology class, or it could be something really serious.\n\nWhat happened in our situation is that someone overheard someone saying something at school, and then they reported it. We found out who the person was, and when we looked through their Facebook, we found some stuff that made us worried. When you post things online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want something out there, don't put it online. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control that - you can't tell people what to take seriously or not.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea for school officials to be friends with students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's a legitimate concern, then it's not an invasion of privacy. I mean, I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I certainly don't want to have to deal with the consequences. That kind of relationship is just not necessary.",
            "Honestly, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which is a noble cause. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective over time. Now, I'm not convinced we're fighting for the right reasons - it's almost like we're doing it out of habit or to prove a point as a global superpower. Looking back, I'm not sure the motives were entirely pure, especially considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first couple of months when we started the war, which was a powerful statement in itself. But continuing it for over a year, or even several years, just feels like an overextension. If our aim was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a justifiable reason for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted and misconceived over time. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, and not wanting to leave without a clear victory.\n\nHonestly, I think it's time to bring this to an end. The government of the country we're fighting in should be able to fend for themselves now. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this conflict when we have our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need attention. It's a financial burden we can no longer afford, especially when that money could be better spent on internal improvements like public roads, education, and healthcare.\n\nWe've got our own problems to address at home, including poverty, healthcare, and education. It's disheartening to see money being spent on casualties in a foreign war that we've lost sight of our purpose for. I think it's time to reassess our priorities and end this war once and for all.",
            "To clarify, something was able to be prevented because someone found your profile online, right? It's because if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. On sites like Myspace, you have to let someone be your friend to see your profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it once you add them. So, anytime you put info online, you should understand that lots of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tough spot because, on the one hand, you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, it becomes unfair to single out certain people and make it their job to check up on everyone. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking around or were they actively searching for something specific?\n\nPersonality, I have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this one show that showed how easily someone could get info on a girl's profile, and it freaked me out. They got her screen name and started chatting with her in under a minute. I know some people in my classes who I don't know, but they know my screen name and where I am during the day. It's hard to know who can see what online, so I try to limit what I post, but I don't want to limit it too much since the whole point is to stay in touch with friends.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because you have to accept people as friends to see your profile, but you never know who can actually see what. I heard that some schools banned students from having Myspace profiles, and that seems a bit strange - I'm not sure how they had the right to do that.",
            "I'm starting to think about this more and it's making me realize how complex the situation with the Iraq War is. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it now, but I've come to the conclusion that it was a bad idea from the beginning. Looking back, it's clear that the general consensus was against it, except within the administration, where they didn't want to admit their mistake. Recent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops currently stationed there. It's astonishing to see such a high percentage of people against the war, both in the US and globally.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the start, and it's difficult to see a way out. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, and administrations have consistently failed to understand this. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region where it's not wanted is unrealistic. While Saddam was a bad leader, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The situation has been like quicksand since we entered, and I don't see any reason for us to stay.\n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I've yet to hear a valid reason. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's worth noting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to 'save' them, yet they're telling us to leave. If we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, it's not on us if things go wrong. If we do decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as the 'good guys,' even if it's a stretch.",
            "Okay, let's talk about this. I really believe that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, either - it's also a problem in certain fields. I think that women, in general, face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling\" that exists, even when it seems like there should be equality. This is because of the way society has been raised for so long, where men are often expected to be in charge.\n\nIn the workplace, women may have all the qualifications for a position, but they might be overlooked because it's not common for women to reach senior positions. This isn't just a women's issue, though - men can face similar challenges too. For example, in fields like fashion or parenting, it's unusual for men to be the primary caregiver, and they can be judged for it. People might think, \"You're a man, you should be working and providing for the family, not staying at home with the kids.\"\n\nIt's also an issue in the fashion industry, where people might not take men seriously if they're straight and interested in fashion. This is because men who enjoy fashion are often stereotyped as having a different lifestyle, and people might wonder if they really understand what fashion is all about.\n\nChanging this mindset is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. However, as more women rise to leadership positions and become accepted in the business world, things are starting to shift. Men are also becoming more accepted as stay-at-home dads, and people are beginning to realize that it's okay for men to take on this role.\n\nI think we need to promote the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but in a way that's not pushy. If we force it, people will resist. We're at a good point right now where things are starting to become more accepted, but we need to keep this momentum going. It's not just a matter of gender, either - people from different backgrounds or with different job skills can face prejudice too.\n\nFor example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Other men might look down on them, saying, \"How can I trust what you're saying if you can't even put together a simple sentence?\" It's not just about gender, but also about where you're from and how you speak.\n\nSo, yeah, that's my take on it. I don't think we're doing enough, but I'm not sure what more we can do at this point. We just need to keep moving forward, one step at a time.",
            "So, it seems that in some areas, marijuana isn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's more like a traffic ticket than a serious crime. This can have implications for things like job interviews, but the effects of a marijuana charge don't necessarily disappear even if it's decriminalized. For instance, when it comes to marijuana, one of the main concerns is the long-term consequences, which can be a real worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is a costly endeavor. It involves booking, housing, public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office, all of which add up. In financially struggling municipalities, some cities might be hesitant to make this change, even if it would free up funds for other important community projects.\n\nHowever, in places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, decriminalizing marijuana can be a great move, allowing the city to redirect funds towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's a complex issue with both financial and social implications.\n\nOne thing to consider is that if marijuana were fully legalized, it could lead to its increased presence in public spaces, which might be uncomfortable for some people. Additionally, it's worth noting that while marijuana's effects on motor skills are often compared to those of alcohol, it can also have a significant impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, people react differently to substances, and it's hard to generalize how they'll be affected.",
            "I'd definitely agree with you because many Catholic practices are steeped in tradition. For instance, they've been following the same customs for a long time. While it's great to be rooted in tradition, it's also essential to be open to change. A lot of Catholics attend church every week and have strict rules about how things should be done. Unfortunately, I think the Catholic Church can come across as judgmental towards people who don't adhere strictly to their doctrine. Moreover, they don't always welcome people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics. This was evident in my family's situation – my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. It's hard to see this as tolerance, especially when you consider that the Catholic Church teaches people to love others. It's hypocritical to say you love others but not accept them. I believe the Catholic Church's teachings often contradict their practices, which can be outdated. They stick to these outdated practices, even though they don't align with their teachings.\n\nI'm not sure if allowing priests to marry would necessarily make them less likely to engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a complex issue, and I don't think it would be a simple solution. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. Children are a different situation than spouses, and it's unlikely that marriage would prevent such behavior.\n\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily prevent these types of incidents from occurring. I think it's possible that these actions would still happen even if priests were allowed to marry. It's a complex issue that requires a deeper look.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I'm struggling to form an opinion. It's tough to say who's right or wrong in this situation. I do think, though, that this is one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. The line between church and state is already blurry, and defining marriage is a delicate matter that can easily offend someone. To be honest, I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed as solely a government-defined institution. Considering it's also a deeply personal and sacred commitment, it's hard to see it as just a civil union. I mean, if two people get married, it's about their union, not about the specific type of marriage they've chosen or the church they attend. So, I think it should be viewed as a civil union, rather than a marriage with government-recognized status. \n\nI also think it's worth noting that the fact that gay marriage is being debated is a bit puzzling. To me, two people in a relationship are entitled to a civil union, regardless of their sexual orientation. If all states can come to a mutually beneficial agreement, then it should be pushed forward as a federal law. However, making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems unnecessary and extreme. It's not a widespread issue that warrants a constitutional amendment. It's just not something significant enough to alter the constitution.\n\nHonestly, I don't think so.",
            "Honestly, I come from a Christian background, and to be honest, this has left me with some mixed feelings about homosexuality. On one hand, I have lots of gay friends, so it's not something I can just dismiss. While I don't personally agree with the way of life, I do think it should be a matter of personal freedom. I believe it's not the government's place to make this decision for everyone, but rather each state should be able to decide for itself.\n\nIt makes sense that in democratic states, there's a higher likelihood of support for gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it's hard to argue with the majority opinion. I think it's only fair that individuals are given the same rights as everyone else, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nAs for President Bush's stance on the issue, I don't think he should have the power to dictate the entire country's views on this. Just because he's in office doesn't mean he gets to decide how every state runs itself. Plus, his views will likely change soon anyway - he's only in office for a couple more years, and if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban on gay marriage, the decision will probably just flip-flop. It's really up to each state to decide what's best for its own citizens, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of that decision.",
            "So I'm trying to figure this out, but let's be real, Myspace is a public platform. If you post something on it, you have to accept that people will see it. That includes school officials, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. They can access it from home, and in my opinion, if it means preventing a school shooting and saving lives, that's perfectly fine. I think it's the school's responsibility to ensure the safety of its students.\n\nIf school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, it feels like an invasion of privacy. But if it leads to making the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. It's like when they do random checks to catch students doing something they shouldn't be doing, but that's a different story.\n\nI feel like posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble is unrealistic. Everything can be found online, and it can come back to haunt you. If you post something as a college student, it can follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nI'm not saying I think it's okay for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's a different story. It's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that's exactly why they monitor online activity.\n\nThey had to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the Columbine incident. They were just trying to prevent anything bad from happening. In this case, school officials were doing the same thing - making the school a safer place by preventing a potential school shooting. That's all I'm saying.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the whole thing. To be honest, I was initially all for it after 9/11 because it was a personal issue for me. I had strong feelings and wanted to do something, but now I'm not so sure. I think we rushed into it without thinking about the long-term consequences. We just kind of went in without a clear plan and, in my opinion, it backfired. Honestly, I was all for it at first, but my feelings have changed. I don't think we accomplished anything by being there. I think the people in that region are too busy fighting each other to focus on fighting us too. It's hard for me to care about what's going on over there because of how they seem to be handling things. It's almost like they're not even human in the way they go to war. They just can't seem to work together, and that's why I don't think we should be there.\n\nI think we went in unprepared and didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. War is a completely different experience for them than for us. They're not looking to improve their country; they're just trying to get rid of us. I think we should just leave and be done with it. We were initially driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, but I don't think we were thinking rationally about the potential consequences. We were more hyped up than focused on creating a solution.\n\nI understand why President Bush made the decision to declare war on Iraq at the time, but I'm not sure we had a choice. However, I do think we could have come up with a better plan and been more united in our goals. We didn't seem to know what we were doing or what we wanted to achieve, and that made things worse. I don't think we're the right people to change them; they've been that way for a long time, and it's not going to change overnight. I don't think we're making enough progress, and it's pointless to stay there any longer. Once we leave, I think it will just collapse, and we can't stay forever. I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying. That's my honest opinion."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. I'm not saying they need a complete overhaul, but they do need to adapt to modern times. They're losing followers because they're not very accepting of certain things, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. I get that they have strong views on these issues, but they're a bit outdated. If they were to update their stance, they might not be losing so many followers. \n\nIt's no secret that people are starting to drift away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these topics. Some individuals are even actively turning against the Church because it doesn't align with their own values. I think the Church is stuck in the past and needs to reconsider its stance on these issues. For instance, if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable with a Church that views it as morally wrong. The same goes for people who believe in gay marriage – they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't accept it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's hard to say whether this would've made a difference in the past, but it's definitely worth considering. The Church claims that priests are married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, most people with careers have both work and personal lives. It doesn't seem fair to expect priests to be any different. They should be able to have a family and devote themselves to both their faith and loved ones.",
            "Honestly, I don't have any major issues with gay marriage. I think the idea that people are born with their sexual orientation is a strong one. In my opinion, individuals shouldn't be held accountable for who they are naturally drawn to. It's not something that's consciously chosen, and I don't think it's right to hold that against them.\n\nI think it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not just a matter of choice; people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. I mean, just like how I was born straight, others are born gay. They shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nI believe it's wrong for the government to dictate who can and can't get married. It's not a matter of law, but rather a matter of personal freedom. I don't think it's right to put people on a pedestal and say they made a wrong choice simply because of their orientation. It's not something they can help, and it's not something they should be ashamed of.\n\nTo me, the government's involvement in this issue seems out of place. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's about people's personal lives. They should be free to make their own choices, and the government shouldn't interfere with that. It's just who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The reasoning behind this is quite simple – there's no valid reason not to. Many people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is a misconception. Homosexuality and heterosexuality are two sides of the same coin, fundamentally different yet equal. It's pointless to try to draw parallels between the two, as they're distinct entities.\n\nOne of the main issues I see is that civil rights are often withheld from same-sex couples. For example, if a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're often barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital or making important medical decisions on their behalf. This is unfair, especially considering that these partners have made a commitment to spend their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It's ridiculous to argue that two people in love, regardless of their sexual orientation, can be treated as separate entities under the law.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that gay couples aren't asking to be married in a church; they're seeking a civil union recognized by the government. If a couple is allowed a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nMany people worry about issues like adoption and how same-sex couples will integrate into their communities. Some fear that children raised by gay parents will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or experience social stigma. However, these concerns are often based on misconceptions and a lack of understanding.\n\nFor instance, in New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and other challenges in public schools. It's heartbreaking to see parents protesting to have their child removed from their school simply because of their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a strong stance on this issue and make gay marriage legal across the board. The proposed amendment is misguided and ignores the moral complexities of the issue. It's hypocritical to allow laws that enforce one group's moral standards on an entire country, especially when there are ongoing debates about issues like the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage simply because they believe that being gay is a choice or a result of childhood trauma. However, this is a misconception that's been debunked by reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association. If we listened to research and facts rather than popular opinion, we might begin to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a medication is banned doesn't mean it doesn't have some benefits. I'm not saying it should be available for everyone, not at all. But, for medical use, yeah, I think it's a different story. It's not beneficial just because it's illegal - that's my point.\n\nYeah, there are loads of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone or Vicodin. Those are used because they have benefits, right? So, if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of a stigma around it, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should accept its benefits and not be so quick to dismiss them.\n\nI don't think it's as similar to booze, actually, because if you overdo it on marijuana it can have problems, but if you overdo it on booze, that's a different story altogether. It's a tricky one, but I'd say we could integrate it slowly, make it legal gradually, not all at once, or it would get abused. But first, we need to get rid of the bad rep around marijuana. People think it's terrible, but it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we could change that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the modern age. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even as I look back on my childhood, I remember always attending church on Sundays, dressed up in cute little outfits. I'd wear matching dresses, shoes, and a purse, and it was a weekly tradition. Going to a private school only made it more fun, as I'd see my friends there. But over time, I've noticed the church has relaxed its rules. They now have a shorter mass, lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during the summer. You'd see families rushing in late, still in their beach clothes. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis - it's a more laid-back atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, this is the church I'm familiar with, but I don't know the inner workings or politics. However, it's definitely become more casual.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't believe allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these situations. There are married men who still have these tendencies, and it's not about whether they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice to become a priest, and some people might just be drawn to that path, regardless of the rules.\n\nEven in other faiths, like Seventh Day Adventism, there are reverends or ministers who are allowed to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different religion.\n\nWhen it comes to pedophilia, I think it's largely genetic. People are born with certain tendencies, and it's not something that's developed over time due to upbringing. It's possible that environment might play a small role, but I believe genetics are the main factor. Trying to change someone's sexuality through marriage wouldn't be effective, as it would likely reveal itself eventually. So, I don't think the church could have prevented these situations, even if they had made changes.\n\nIf there were cases where the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, that's a different issue altogether. However, I don't think that was the case in every situation. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "At first, I was somewhat okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seems to me that we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts, and the Bush administration used false connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks to justify the war. This really didn't sit well with me, as it's now clear that Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs, claims that were made at the time. \n\nI think the Bush administration has consistently lied to the American people, and to this day, they refuse to acknowledge it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I believe this is a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The administration has consistently disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since 9/11, at least. It's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. \n\nThe Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were suspect from the start. There were allegations made by a former treasury secretary that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and was also looking to expand the US's energy supply, which I think is a pretty underhanded way to go about it. \n\nI think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing troops now would be problematic. It's possible that the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more casualties. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia restoring order, doesn't necessarily sit well with me either. I worry that it would lead to more issues down the line, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government is already ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to function. The Prime Minister has little control, and parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's, which holds 20 seats, are causing a lot of friction in the government. It's clear that the political process is experiencing a lot of tension due to these radical elements vying for power. \n\nTo be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the complexity of the situation. I don't have a clear solution to articulate in polite conversation.",
            "I'm having trouble articulating my thoughts on the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's all a bit confusing because it was never officially declared a war by Congress. It seems like it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, and we're still trying to build a democracy in Iraq, which is a daunting task that will likely take a long time. I'm not really sure why we're staying there, but it's partly because of oil and also because we want to help them create a stable government.\n\nHowever, it's clear that the whole situation is causing a lot of upset, and the longer we stay, the more complicated it gets. If we leave, the Iraqis might be angry with us for messing things up, but if we stay, we'll have to keep trying to impose our way of life on them, which could just make things worse. It's a tough situation, and I'm not sure what the best course of action is.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot, and I think we should be honest with ourselves about why we're really there. Is it because we're trying to help the Iraqis, or is it because we want to show off our military power? I'm not sure, and I think that's part of the problem. We shouldn't be calling it a war if it's not a declared one, and we shouldn't be using it as an excuse to flex our muscles.\n\nAt the same time, I feel for the families whose loved ones are over there fighting. I want to support them and want the war to be over so they can come home safely. But at the same time, I'm worried that we're just making things worse by staying there. We're disrupting their culture and way of life, and it's creating more problems than it's solving. It's like we're trying to force them to become a mini-version of the US, and that's not going to work.\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for years to come, and it's hard to know what the outcome will be. I'm just not sure what to think anymore, and it's all so complicated.",
            "Honestly, I have doubts about making something legal or having the government declare it as such. In my opinion, it's really up to the churches to decide because the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This is a fundamental principle that's already been written in stone, and trying to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of that. It seems like those pushing for it are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another.\n\nI think it's clear that most Catholics and Christians are against this, with some exceptions in certain areas. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, as that's not what the constitution is about. The separation of church and state has allowed for religious tolerance in the United States, and trying to change that with an amendment would be counterintuitive and contradictory. It's also worth noting that this amendment would likely be one of the only ones used to restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI strongly believe that the federal government should stay out of this issue, as I don't see a valid reason for the president's push for an amendment. It seems like his actions are driven by his own Catholic beliefs, which would give preference to that particular religion over others. The churches should be the ones deciding this, not the government, and there's no concrete evidence suggesting that an amendment is necessary. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society, rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've covered all my points on this.",
            "You might want to read the previous post before this one.  I'm feeling a bit clearer now about the US involvement in Iraq.  I think what's making it even more complicated is the way things went down.  We started the war just a month after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, and I'm not convinced that the government was entirely honest about the reasons behind the invasion.  I genuinely think they tried to tie the two events together, even though they weren't as connected as they seemed.  The war started in 2003, and I was against it from the very beginning, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.  It's like a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government not learning from its past mistakes.\n\nThink about it, a huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, and that's absolutely devastating.  The US was essentially removing the Iraqi government, but I'm not sure they were prepared for the chaos that would follow.  They wanted to establish a democratic government, just like in Vietnam, but that's not always a straightforward process.  I think the US government made it seem like it would be easy, but it's not that simple.  We're still in Iraq, and it's been years since the war started, with American troops still dying and trying to train the Iraqi military and police to take control of their country - it's a long and difficult process.\n\nIn hindsight, I think the government was not fully prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and they might have even deceived the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful operation.  Implementing a new form of government takes years, and it's not something that can be rushed or taken lightly, as we've seen in our own country's history.  It's not an easy thing to do, and I think the government made it seem like it was.\n\nThis was a major factor in my decision in the 2004 presidential election - I was torn between voting for George Bush, who had started the war, and the uncertainty of what would happen if we left Iraq.  It's a difficult decision, especially when we've been there for so long and taken away their government and way of life.  We can't just abandon them now, but at the same time, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify risking so many lives.\n\nThe reason we invaded Iraq in the first place was supposed to be to make it a democratic nation, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same in other countries?  I think the real reason is the oil issue - it's all about controlling resources and getting the oil.  Another factor was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out that was a false claim.  Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we know has those types of weapons, haven't been targeted.  It just seems like the US government is not being thorough or honest in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but it's hard to be optimistic about that right now.",
            "I'm gonna be honest, I think I'm in favor of gay marriage. To be honest, I've always been this way. I believe it's a personal preference, and what's more, science now shows it's not just a social influence, but actually has a biological basis. I don't think it's fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's just inhumane, in my opinion. As someone who's always been an advocate for gay marriage, I think the government should stay out of it. It's a personal matter, not a state or national issue. Look at my neighborhood, for example – there are openly gay couples living there, just like any other family. They do the same things everyone else does, like walking their dogs. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to decide what marriage means, and I think it's kind of laughable. I've read and heard from various sources that it's actually a chemical thing in the brain, something you might be predisposed to. It's not just about how you grow up or your family dynamics. So, it's more about biology than social environment.\n\nTo be honest, the only real difference is that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, like in Las Vegas, without anyone knowing. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a big public deal, splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something the government or media gets involved in.",
            "You know, when you post something online, it's out there for everyone to see. It's a public forum, after all. As an R.A., I've already had to deal with this kind of thing. Once something's online, it can shape people's opinions about you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like blowing things up or shootings, someone's bound to notice. You can't put that kind of thing out there, because it's going to be seen by everyone. The internet is a vast and open space, and if someone's friends with you on Myspace or Facebook, they're going to get that bulletin.\n\nIt's not like the school itself got wind of the bulletin - someone had to go to the school and report it. And then the school has to act on it, because they can't just ignore it in case something actually happens. It's a matter of preventing potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, because some people just mess around online. It could be like that silly experiment that went wrong in our sociology class, or it could be something really serious.\n\nWhat happened in our situation is that someone overheard someone saying something at school, and then they reported it. We found out who the person was, and when we looked through their Facebook, we found some stuff that made us worried. When you post things online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want something out there, don't put it online. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control that - you can't tell people what to take seriously or not.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea for school officials to be friends with students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's a legitimate concern, then it's not an invasion of privacy. I mean, I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I certainly don't want to have to deal with the consequences. That kind of relationship is just not necessary.",
            "Honestly, I think this war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which is a noble cause. However, it seems we've lost sight of that objective over time. Now, I'm not convinced we're fighting for the right reasons - it's almost like we're doing it out of habit or to prove a point as a global superpower. Looking back, I'm not sure the motives were entirely pure, especially considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first couple of months when we started the war, which was a powerful statement in itself. But continuing it for over a year, or even several years, just feels like an overextension. If our aim was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a justifiable reason for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted and misconceived over time. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, and not wanting to leave without a clear victory.\n\nHonestly, I think it's time to bring this to an end. The government of the country we're fighting in should be able to fend for themselves now. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this conflict when we have our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure that need attention. It's a financial burden we can no longer afford, especially when that money could be better spent on internal improvements like public roads, education, and healthcare.\n\nWe've got our own problems to address at home, including poverty, healthcare, and education. It's disheartening to see money being spent on casualties in a foreign war that we've lost sight of our purpose for. I think it's time to reassess our priorities and end this war once and for all.",
            "To clarify, something was able to be prevented because someone found your profile online, right? It's because if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. On sites like Myspace, you have to let someone be your friend to see your profile, but you're basically giving them permission to see it once you add them. So, anytime you put info online, you should understand that lots of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tough spot because, on the one hand, you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, it becomes unfair to single out certain people and make it their job to check up on everyone. It really depends on the situation - were they just randomly looking around or were they actively searching for something specific?\n\nPersonality, I have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this one show that showed how easily someone could get info on a girl's profile, and it freaked me out. They got her screen name and started chatting with her in under a minute. I know some people in my classes who I don't know, but they know my screen name and where I am during the day. It's hard to know who can see what online, so I try to limit what I post, but I don't want to limit it too much since the whole point is to stay in touch with friends.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because you have to accept people as friends to see your profile, but you never know who can actually see what. I heard that some schools banned students from having Myspace profiles, and that seems a bit strange - I'm not sure how they had the right to do that.",
            "I'm starting to think about this more and it's making me realize how complex the situation with the Iraq War is. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it now, but I've come to the conclusion that it was a bad idea from the beginning. Looking back, it's clear that the general consensus was against it, except within the administration, where they didn't want to admit their mistake. Recent polls have shown that around 75-80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops currently stationed there. It's astonishing to see such a high percentage of people against the war, both in the US and globally.\n\nThe situation has been a disaster from the start, and it's difficult to see a way out. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, and administrations have consistently failed to understand this. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region where it's not wanted is unrealistic. While Saddam was a bad leader, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster. The situation has been like quicksand since we entered, and I don't see any reason for us to stay.\n\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I've yet to hear a valid reason. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's worth noting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to 'save' them, yet they're telling us to leave. If we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, it's not on us if things go wrong. If we do decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as the 'good guys,' even if it's a stretch.",
            "Okay, let's talk about this. I really believe that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, either - it's also a problem in certain fields. I think that women, in general, face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling\" that exists, even when it seems like there should be equality. This is because of the way society has been raised for so long, where men are often expected to be in charge.\n\nIn the workplace, women may have all the qualifications for a position, but they might be overlooked because it's not common for women to reach senior positions. This isn't just a women's issue, though - men can face similar challenges too. For example, in fields like fashion or parenting, it's unusual for men to be the primary caregiver, and they can be judged for it. People might think, \"You're a man, you should be working and providing for the family, not staying at home with the kids.\"\n\nIt's also an issue in the fashion industry, where people might not take men seriously if they're straight and interested in fashion. This is because men who enjoy fashion are often stereotyped as having a different lifestyle, and people might wonder if they really understand what fashion is all about.\n\nChanging this mindset is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. However, as more women rise to leadership positions and become accepted in the business world, things are starting to shift. Men are also becoming more accepted as stay-at-home dads, and people are beginning to realize that it's okay for men to take on this role.\n\nI think we need to promote the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but in a way that's not pushy. If we force it, people will resist. We're at a good point right now where things are starting to become more accepted, but we need to keep this momentum going. It's not just a matter of gender, either - people from different backgrounds or with different job skills can face prejudice too.\n\nFor example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Other men might look down on them, saying, \"How can I trust what you're saying if you can't even put together a simple sentence?\" It's not just about gender, but also about where you're from and how you speak.\n\nSo, yeah, that's my take on it. I don't think we're doing enough, but I'm not sure what more we can do at this point. We just need to keep moving forward, one step at a time.",
            "So, it seems that in some areas, marijuana isn't fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's more like a traffic ticket than a serious crime. This can have implications for things like job interviews, but the effects of a marijuana charge don't necessarily disappear even if it's decriminalized. For instance, when it comes to marijuana, one of the main concerns is the long-term consequences, which can be a real worry for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is a costly endeavor. It involves booking, housing, public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office, all of which add up. In financially struggling municipalities, some cities might be hesitant to make this change, even if it would free up funds for other important community projects.\n\nHowever, in places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, decriminalizing marijuana can be a great move, allowing the city to redirect funds towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's a complex issue with both financial and social implications.\n\nOne thing to consider is that if marijuana were fully legalized, it could lead to its increased presence in public spaces, which might be uncomfortable for some people. Additionally, it's worth noting that while marijuana's effects on motor skills are often compared to those of alcohol, it can also have a significant impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, people react differently to substances, and it's hard to generalize how they'll be affected.",
            "I'd definitely agree with you because many Catholic practices are steeped in tradition. For instance, they've been following the same customs for a long time. While it's great to be rooted in tradition, it's also essential to be open to change. A lot of Catholics attend church every week and have strict rules about how things should be done. Unfortunately, I think the Catholic Church can come across as judgmental towards people who don't adhere strictly to their doctrine. Moreover, they don't always welcome people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics. This was evident in my family's situation – my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. It's hard to see this as tolerance, especially when you consider that the Catholic Church teaches people to love others. It's hypocritical to say you love others but not accept them. I believe the Catholic Church's teachings often contradict their practices, which can be outdated. They stick to these outdated practices, even though they don't align with their teachings.\n\nI'm not sure if allowing priests to marry would necessarily make them less likely to engage in pedophilic behavior. It's a complex issue, and I don't think it would be a simple solution. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. Children are a different situation than spouses, and it's unlikely that marriage would prevent such behavior.\n\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily prevent these types of incidents from occurring. I think it's possible that these actions would still happen even if priests were allowed to marry. It's a complex issue that requires a deeper look.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I'm struggling to form an opinion. It's tough to say who's right or wrong in this situation. I do think, though, that this is one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. The line between church and state is already blurry, and defining marriage is a delicate matter that can easily offend someone. To be honest, I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed as solely a government-defined institution. Considering it's also a deeply personal and sacred commitment, it's hard to see it as just a civil union. I mean, if two people get married, it's about their union, not about the specific type of marriage they've chosen or the church they attend. So, I think it should be viewed as a civil union, rather than a marriage with government-recognized status. \n\nI also think it's worth noting that the fact that gay marriage is being debated is a bit puzzling. To me, two people in a relationship are entitled to a civil union, regardless of their sexual orientation. If all states can come to a mutually beneficial agreement, then it should be pushed forward as a federal law. However, making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems unnecessary and extreme. It's not a widespread issue that warrants a constitutional amendment. It's just not something significant enough to alter the constitution.\n\nHonestly, I don't think so.",
            "Honestly, I come from a Christian background, and to be honest, this has left me with some mixed feelings about homosexuality. On one hand, I have lots of gay friends, so it's not something I can just dismiss. While I don't personally agree with the way of life, I do think it should be a matter of personal freedom. I believe it's not the government's place to make this decision for everyone, but rather each state should be able to decide for itself.\n\nIt makes sense that in democratic states, there's a higher likelihood of support for gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, it's hard to argue with the majority opinion. I think it's only fair that individuals are given the same rights as everyone else, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nAs for President Bush's stance on the issue, I don't think he should have the power to dictate the entire country's views on this. Just because he's in office doesn't mean he gets to decide how every state runs itself. Plus, his views will likely change soon anyway - he's only in office for a couple more years, and if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban on gay marriage, the decision will probably just flip-flop. It's really up to each state to decide what's best for its own citizens, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of that decision.",
            "So I'm trying to figure this out, but let's be real, Myspace is a public platform. If you post something on it, you have to accept that people will see it. That includes school officials, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. They can access it from home, and in my opinion, if it means preventing a school shooting and saving lives, that's perfectly fine. I think it's the school's responsibility to ensure the safety of its students.\n\nIf school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, it feels like an invasion of privacy. But if it leads to making the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. It's like when they do random checks to catch students doing something they shouldn't be doing, but that's a different story.\n\nI feel like posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble is unrealistic. Everything can be found online, and it can come back to haunt you. If you post something as a college student, it can follow you for the rest of your life. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\n\nI'm not saying I think it's okay for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to make the school a safer place, then that's a different story. It's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said that's exactly why they monitor online activity.\n\nThey had to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the Columbine incident. They were just trying to prevent anything bad from happening. In this case, school officials were doing the same thing - making the school a safer place by preventing a potential school shooting. That's all I'm saying.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking a lot about the whole thing. To be honest, I was initially all for it after 9/11 because it was a personal issue for me. I had strong feelings and wanted to do something, but now I'm not so sure. I think we rushed into it without thinking about the long-term consequences. We just kind of went in without a clear plan and, in my opinion, it backfired. Honestly, I was all for it at first, but my feelings have changed. I don't think we accomplished anything by being there. I think the people in that region are too busy fighting each other to focus on fighting us too. It's hard for me to care about what's going on over there because of how they seem to be handling things. It's almost like they're not even human in the way they go to war. They just can't seem to work together, and that's why I don't think we should be there.\n\nI think we went in unprepared and didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. War is a completely different experience for them than for us. They're not looking to improve their country; they're just trying to get rid of us. I think we should just leave and be done with it. We were initially driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, but I don't think we were thinking rationally about the potential consequences. We were more hyped up than focused on creating a solution.\n\nI understand why President Bush made the decision to declare war on Iraq at the time, but I'm not sure we had a choice. However, I do think we could have come up with a better plan and been more united in our goals. We didn't seem to know what we were doing or what we wanted to achieve, and that made things worse. I don't think we're the right people to change them; they've been that way for a long time, and it's not going to change overnight. I don't think we're making enough progress, and it's pointless to stay there any longer. Once we leave, I think it will just collapse, and we can't stay forever. I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying. That's my honest opinion."
