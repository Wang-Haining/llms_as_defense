            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's due to their strict views on certain issues. I'm talking about topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While it's okay that they have strong opinions, some of these views might be seen as outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, I think they'd be less worried about losing followers.\n\nI've heard that many people, including some who were once devoted to the Catholic Church, have begun to disagree with their stance on these matters. This is because their views on issues like abortion and gay marriage might not align with the values of some individuals. As a result, people are starting to question the Church's stance and might feel that their views are outdated.\n\nTake the issue of abortion, for instance. If you're in favor of it, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community where it's strongly discouraged. The same goes for gay marriage – if you believe in it or support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's not like having a family or personal life would distract them from their devotion to God. The Church already says that priests are married to God, so why can't they have a family and dedicated relationships like everyone else in the world? It just doesn't make sense to me.",
            "Honestly, I don't have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose consciously, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. I believe it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. \n\nTo me, it seems that people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I was born straight and another person might be born gay. It's not something they can control or make a conscious decision about. It doesn't seem right to hold them responsible for something that's not their choice. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue at all. It's a personal matter that's not a security threat or a moral concern, but rather a matter of individual rights. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives or dictate who they can love. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nI'm not sure how to put it exactly, but it just seems like a matter of treating everyone with respect and equality, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think the federal government has a right to interject in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as love and relationships. \n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason not to. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. It's a completely different situation, with a multitude of factors that make it in no way comparable. It's like two sides of the same coin; you can't have heads without tails. A gay couple's relationship is built on the same fundamental aspects as a heterosexual one, with the same potential for success and satisfaction.\n\nThe issue is that same-sex couples often face unfair treatment under the law. For example, a partner may not be allowed to be with their sick loved one in the hospital or visit them because they're not considered family. This is illogical, especially considering that these couples are committed to each other for life. Studies have shown that same-sex relationships have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones, with the same factors contributing to happiness.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many couples have the same roles in their relationships, and the only difference is the sex of the partners.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, such as how a gay couple will affect their neighborhood and their children's well-being. However, these concerns are unfounded. Children of same-sex couples are no different from those of heterosexual couples; they have the same potential for success and happiness, and their parents' sexual orientation has no bearing on their upbringing.\n\nIn fact, many communities, like New York City, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and persecution in public schools. This is unacceptable. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about their love and ability to care for their children. \n\nI believe the federal government should play a significant role in making gay marriage legal across the country. The current amendment is misguided, and it's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on an entire nation, especially when it conflicts with the values of other groups. We should focus on what's fair and just, rather than what some people believe is morally right.\n\nSome people oppose gay marriage because they think gay individuals are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has stated that this is not true. We should rely on scientific research and studies, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, to understand this issue.",
            "Listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer and I wanted to share some thoughts on this. Just because a drug is considered illicit doesn't mean it's completely without benefits. I'm not saying we should make it accessible to the public, no way, not at all. However, I do think it has potential for medicinal use. It's a common misconception that just because a drug is banned, it's not beneficial. I think that's what I'm trying to get at.\n\nYeah, let me put it another way. There are plenty of controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them because they have proven benefits, even if they're not widely accepted. So, why can't the same be said for marijuana? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than the taboo surrounding it.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that comparable to alcohol. While abusing marijuana can have negative effects, so can alcohol. It's a delicate issue, but I think if we approach it carefully, we could make it work. Maybe we could regulate its use gradually, rather than making it completely legal all at once. That way, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nPeople often have a skewed view of marijuana because it's been labeled as an illicit substance. But in reality, it's not as bad as some other drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's perception of it, they might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I've been thinking about how the church has adapted to the 21st century, and it's clear that it's not as strict as it used to be. I'm not saying this as a bad thing; it's actually quite refreshing. I remember my childhood, where I'd attend church every Sunday, looking forward to seeing my friends from private school and dressing up in my favorite outfits. It was a big deal, I'd pick out a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse that complemented everything. But as I grew older, I noticed a change. They introduced a more casual, 30-minute mass, especially during the summer. People would walk in straight from the beach, and families would rush in late. Even during morning masses, where I'd always try to look polished, people started wearing jeans and khakis. It's not a bad thing; it's just a more relaxed atmosphere. The only thing I've noticed is that the church has become more laid-back. I don't know the inner workings of the church, but that's my observation.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have a problem with pedophilia, so it's not a matter of being allowed to get married or not. When someone decides to become a priest, it's a personal choice, and they're aware of their desires. Some other religions allow their clergy to be married, like Seventh-day Adventists, for example. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might consider a different faith. I think the issue is more complex than a simple solution like changing the rules.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their environment. While upbringing might play a small role, I believe it's mostly innate. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and tried to cover them up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they were aware of everything. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments at this time.",
            "(laughs) Initially, I was somewhat okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went to Iraq as a pretext, following other factors that led to the invasion. I think the Bush administration hastily connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. That really got under my skin, and the Iraq war still really bothers me.\n\nTo be honest, it seems to me that the Bush administration was dishonest with the American people and has yet to acknowledge this fact. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by it at the time. That's a serious breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to deceive the public like that. The Bush administration appears to have disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since September 11th, at least. I believe they had a preconceived intention to go to war when they took office.\n\nThat last part reminds me of the treasury secretary who wrote in his book that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration, and was also hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run - a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nIn my opinion, it's gone on long enough. Withdrawing our troops now would likely lead to problems, as there's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and more people would die. The alternative seems to be a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either, as it could create long-term problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing its job, according to news reports. The Prime Minister has little control, and even Mugtada al-Sadr's party, which we were fighting just a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in Parliament. This is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nI don't have any suggestions for a solution that I can discuss in polite company.",
            "I'm going to try to articulate my thoughts on the War in Iraq, but I'm not entirely sure where to start. I guess it's because I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but at this point, it feels like we're staying there for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It gets down to building a democracy, but that's a long-term goal that might take forever, and in the meantime, it's just causing a lot of tension. It's hard to see how this is going to play out, and I'm not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind is that this whole thing shouldn't have been called a war in the first place, since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a key point, and it's something to consider. I'm not sure why we're still trying to stay involved, especially when it's causing so much distress both here and in Iraq. It feels like we're just trying to show off our strength, but at what cost?\n\nI've been thinking a lot about this and it's really hard for me to take a clear stance. On one hand, I feel bad for the families of soldiers who are over there, and I don't want to see them get hurt. On the other hand, I'm worried that we're causing more harm by staying there, trying to impose our values on a culture that's so different from ours. It's a delicate balance, and I'm not sure what the right answer is.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think this war is going to be resolved anytime soon. It's going to take years, and it's going to be a long and complicated process. I just wish we could find a way to move forward in a way that's less destructive and more beneficial to everyone involved.",
            "I'm not sure I agree with making it legal or illegal, as it's really a matter for the churches to decide. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be against what's already been said and written. It seems like those trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another, like how most Catholics and Christians are against it except in some areas. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can or can't make illegal. The separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the US. Even considering an amendment would be contradictory to what's already been written and would restrict people's rights rather than the government's.\n\nI'm not sure why the government is getting involved in this issue, considering it's against the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. It feels like his push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's really up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There doesn't seem to be a valid reason for the amendment, except for personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive effect on society. I think I've already covered my points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "I'd like to start by saying that I think the US government wasn't entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons behind the war in Iraq.  I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they didn't have a direct connection. This played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the traumatic events of 2001, and the invasion began in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the Iraq war is eerily similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. We lost a tremendous number of American soldiers, and it's horrible. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but they didn't have a plan for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum and chaos in its wake. The US is still trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, where they tried to push out Communists and implement democracy. However, we should have known it wouldn't be a straightforward victory, and that the outcome would be far from clear-cut.\n\nWe're dealing with a situation where we're fighting the citizens of the country, not a traditional army, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency. I think the government was underprepared for the complexities of the situation and didn't plan for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq, and it's almost 2007, with many American troops still dying and struggling to train the Iraqi security forces. I believe the US government was trying to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. However, establishing a new government takes years, and we shouldn't have been so naive about it.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and difficult struggle, with many civil wars and power struggles. It's not an easy thing to implement, and I think the government made it seem like a relatively easy feat. The decision to go to war in Iraq is a tough one, and I had similar doubts during the 2004 presidential election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was that he should finish what he started, but now I'm not so sure. It's hard to abandon the people we've gotten involved with, especially after taking away their government and way of life. On the other hand, we can't ignore the high number of American casualties and the risks we're taking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe reason we're only focusing on Iraq is likely because of the oil issue and control of resources. Before invading, we claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We're not taking the same action against countries like North Korea, which actually has these weapons. I don't think the US government is thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making process. I just hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm afraid that's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, I'm thinking, and I'm coming to the realization that I'm definitely for gay marriage. This has been my stance for a while now, and the more I learn, the more I believe that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to withhold rights from individuals based on something they can't control.\n\nTo me, this is a personal issue, not something that governments or politics should be involved in, especially at the state or federal level. I know people in my neighborhood who are openly gay, and they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, contribute to the community, and deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else.\n\nIt's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to redefine the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda. I've read and learned from various sources that there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nUltimately, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not something that's scrutinized and sensationalized by the media. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it quietly, without anyone's knowledge or approval. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's front-page news – it's just not fair.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it becomes a public forum available to everyone. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Once you put something out there, it can color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably bring it up. You can't share that kind of information publicly because the internet reaches a huge audience, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they'll likely receive that post. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in that situation, but rather an individual who took it to the school. They had to act on it because they couldn't just ignore it in case something serious did happen and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's also hard to know what to take seriously because some people just joke around online. It's like that situation we had at school where someone might have been doing an experiment for a sociology class that went wrong, or it could be a very serious issue. What happened was that someone overheard a statement made in school and reported it, and when we found out who made the comment, we looked into their online profiles, specifically Facebook, where we found some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke, but became serious in the context. \n\nWhen you put things online, there's no invasion of privacy involved. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they interpret your words. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media and snoop through their profiles, but if someone brings it to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because you gave them access by being friends. If there's a danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also think it's not right for teachers to create fake social media profiles to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to be aware of their personal lives, especially when they're posting photos that might get me involved. I don't think it's my place to know that.",
            "I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At first, I believed the purpose was noble, aimed at restoring democracy in another nation. However, it seems we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of it, almost as a way to prove our power on the global stage. I'm starting to think the original motivations were questionable, particularly considering the previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein that George Bush's father was involved in.\n\nIf our initial intention was truly to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, then that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if personal interests weren't involved. In my opinion, the war has gone on for far too long. I believe we made our point within the first few months, with the initial invasion serving as a powerful statement. But with it now stretching into years, I think it's become a drawn-out conflict.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a valid reason for the war. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, it seems we're still fighting mainly because we want to prove our determination to see it through, rather than achieving a decisive victory. I believe it's time to bring this war to an end.\n\nI think the conflict has gone on long enough, and it's time for the country's government to take responsibility for their own affairs. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. Meanwhile, we have our own internal problems, such as poverty and underfunded public services, that we should be addressing. The money spent on this war could be better used to improve our own country's infrastructure, healthcare, and education.\n\nI think we've reached a point where we need to re-evaluate our priorities. We have citizens back home who are suffering, and the money being spent on this war could be better spent on their welfare. It's time for us to reassess our involvement and bring this war to a close.",
            "Hey, I was wondering if I could clarify something. You see, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue. I think it's fair to say that when you put information on the internet, you're basically making it available for anyone to see. On sites like Myspace, for instance, if you're friends with someone, they can view your profile, and that's just how it works. I mean, if you've accepted someone as your friend on Myspace, you're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nI think that's a good thing, actually - that someone was able to notice the issue and step in. However, it's a bit complicated because schools can't really have someone monitoring students' profiles all the time to prevent problems. It's not practical, and it raises questions of fairness, like why would they single out certain students? I'm not sure it's right to have someone's job be to snoop through people's profiles.\n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just browsing profiles randomly, or was there a specific reason they were looking for something? I'm not really sure. I personally have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this documentary once about a guy who was trying to prove how easy it is to get information from people online. He got a girl's screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger - pretty creepy stuff.\n\nI've had people in my classes who I don't know, and they IM me, which is a bit unsettling. They can figure out a lot about you if you post enough information online, like your photos, class schedule, and friend list. It's a tricky balance between sharing enough to stay in touch with friends and keeping your personal stuff private. I only accept people I know on my social media, but you can never really know who's looking at your stuff.\n\nI remember hearing that my roommate's high school had a thing where students were banned from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It's a bit of a gray area, to be honest.",
            "I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War now. I mean, I've changed my mind on the matter. What really matters isn't whether I was against it from the start or not. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, and it's hard to deny that when you look at the polls. From the US to Iraq and even globally, around 75 to 80% of the population thinks it was a mistake. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops serving there believe it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure what to say, but it's clear that the situation has been disastrous from the start. It was a disaster before we invaded, and now pulling out will be difficult too. The culture clash between the US and Middle Eastern countries is massive, and I don't think we can just impose our system on them. I mean, we can't expect them to adopt democracy when it's not their choice. I'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. I just don't see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for why we should stay, but I haven't been convinced. I'd be okay with a gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's interesting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, shouldn't we listen to their opinions? If they tell us to leave, and something goes wrong, we can say we were trying to follow their lead. That way, we'll at least be the good guys, even if it's not that simple in the Middle East. Anyway, I guess that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "You brought up a really valid point about gender discrimination in the United States. I definitely think it's still an issue, and I'm not just talking about women. I think it's more about the specific industry you're in, as well. I mean, in general, women still face more obstacles, like the \"glass ceiling\" where people struggle to find opportunities to work under a female leader, even when they have the qualifications for the job. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long.\n\nIt's not just women, though; men face similar challenges in certain industries, like fashion or childcare. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and care for the kids, as if it's not a traditional role for them. They might even get judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men might be taken less seriously if they're straight, simply because people assume they don't know what fashion is about.\n\nIt's all about how society has these preconceived notions, and it's hard to change that. We've made progress, but it's slow. As more women take on leadership roles and become CEOs, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, people are starting to see things from a different perspective. But it's not just about forcing change; we need to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If we push too hard, people will resist. We're at a good point now, where change is happening gradually, and I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that isn't already being done.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, accent, or education level, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent. So, it's not just about gender; it's about how society views different groups of people.",
            "To be honest, I think decriminalizing marijuana simply means it's no longer considered a crime, but rather a minor offense, like a traffic ticket. You get cited and don't have to go through the hassle of an arrest and all that comes with it. That being said, the consequences still linger, especially when it comes to things like job interviews and other serious aspects of life. Even with decriminalization, people still worry about the long-term effects, and that doesn't just disappear.\n\nOn the other hand, it's argued that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is costly. Think about it – you've got the costs of arresting, booking, and housing them, plus the expense of multiple court appearances, public defenders, judges, and prosecutors. When you're dealing with financially struggling municipalities, some places just can't afford to make that leap, even if it would free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless.\n\nDenver, being a more open-minded city, has taken a different approach. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've actually been able to allocate more funds to valuable community programs. It's not just about being permissive; it's about being responsible and making smart financial decisions.\n\nHowever, there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of complete legalization. If it were like cigarettes, you'd have people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many places. It's a complex issue, and opinions vary widely. Some might say it's awkward to have it out in the open, while others might argue it's better to be upfront about it.\n\nPersonally, I think marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles than just their motor skills, but it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. People react differently to substances, and some can handle them better than others. It's hard to generalize, but I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree to the idea because of a few reasons. Many of their customs are deeply rooted in tradition, which has been the case for a long time. On one hand, sticking to tradition is a good thing, but on the other hand, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I think it's a bit hypocritical that some Catholics expect people to follow their doctrine to the letter but are not open to those who don't fit the mold. For instance, my parents, both from different faiths, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background.\n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church preaches love and acceptance, but it doesn't always practice what it preaches. They claim to teach love for others, but they don't always put this into action when it comes to people from different faiths. I feel like the doctrine and practice don't always align because it's become outdated, but they still stick to it anyway.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in the way some priests behave. I think that people who have a history of child abuse would likely do so regardless of whether they're married or not. Being married is not a barrier to such behavior, as it's a much more complex issue. Allowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents from occurring.\n\nBut let's focus on the positive aspects. There are some good things about the Catholic Church, and I think it would be beneficial to adapt to some of these changes.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet. I'm not sure if either side is right or wrong, but I do think this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with today. The line between separating church and state, and how we define marriage is a delicate one, and it's hard to tackle without causing offense.\n\nTo be honest, I'm torn on this one - I'm not sure if marriage should be viewed as a civil union or something more. Given that it's considered a sacrament by some, it's tricky to decide how the government should look at it. If people are baptized, they often get special tax breaks or other benefits, so I think the government should treat all unions as civil unions, regardless of their church ties. It's just about two people coming together, and the government shouldn't get involved in the details of their relationship.\n\nI also think that if we can reach a logical conclusion on this issue at a state level, it should be made into a federal law. However, pushing for a constitutional amendment just to ban gay marriage seems extreme - the constitution shouldn't be changed for something that's not a major issue. It's just not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nTo me, it's as simple as that - we shouldn't amend the constitution to define marriage or ban gay marriage. It's a matter of personal choice, and the government shouldn't interfere.",
            "To be honest, I grew up in a Christian household, which created a bit of confusion for me when it comes to homosexuality. Having close gay friends has made me think about this issue more, and while I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue that the president should decide on, but rather something that individual states should have control over.\n\nI know that many states are divided in their views, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you're living in a state that's already leaning towards accepting gay marriage, it's hard to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to make that place your home. I genuinely believe that everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not right for the president to dictate how the entire country should feel about gay marriage. George Bush, in particular, shouldn't have the authority to ban it nationwide, as he doesn't live in every state. That decision should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves. With Bush's term ending in a couple of years, I think it's just a waste of time for him to take a stance on this issue, as future presidents could just reverse his decision. Ultimately, it's the states that will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president.\n\nMy answer is clear: no, I don't think the president should have the power to decide on this issue for the whole country.",
            "Honestly, I just don't get it. Let me try to break it down. MySpace is essentially a public platform, like a bulletin board where you share things for others to see. If you post something online, it's out there for anyone to see, including school officials, not just those who access it directly through the school's account. Even if it's not under the school's name, they can still find it from their homes. So, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent something like a school shooting and saves students' lives - which is a school's responsibility - then I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to see if students are engaging in prohibited activities. I think that's an invasion of privacy, but if it leads to a safer school environment, I'm okay with it. If it's about keeping students safe, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nTo be honest, it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing rather than speaking. What I'm trying to say is that if a student posts something on Myspace and expects not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Posting something online means it's out there forever, and you never know who might see it. Even emails can come back to haunt you, and once something's on the internet, it's there to stay.\n\nIf you do something as a college student and it gets discovered later, it can cause trouble. It's not an invasion of privacy if you post something publicly. I've said it before: it's a public platform, so if officials use it to keep the school safe, I think that's fine. If they have a legitimate reason to investigate, like preventing a school shooting, then I'm okay with it.\n\nIn fact, my old teacher told me that schools have to ensure they do things like lock downs to keep students safe. It's not just about school shootings; it's about being prepared for any emergency. Even though it might seem unrelated, it's all about keeping the school safe. The school officials were just doing their job by monitoring Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like another Columbine. That's about it.",
            "Honestly, I was initially very supportive of going to war after 9/11. I was deeply affected by the event and felt a strong desire for retaliation. However, looking back, I think we rushed into it without a solid plan in place. It was an emotional response rather than a well-thought-out decision. We went in unprepared and without a clear understanding of the long-term consequences.\n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's achieved anything positive. As long as the people in the region are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to target us. It's like fighting a never-ending battle – they can't even agree with each other, let alone with us.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 made me lose interest in what happens over there. I've come to feel that they're more like savages in war, and it's not about improving their country; it's about getting rid of us. I think we should just leave and let them handle their own affairs.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe we were more driven by emotions and a desire for revenge than a rational understanding of the situation. It was a case of seeking revenge rather than solving the underlying issues. President Bush was partly driven by public opinion, and he declared war on Iraq without a clear plan. While I can see where he was coming from, I think we should have been more cautious.\n\nWe had to act after 9/11, but we could have done it in a more thoughtful and strategic way. There was a lack of unity and a clear plan for creating order in Iraq, which made things worse. I don't think we're the ones who can change those people or their ways. They'll always be like that, and it's pointless for us to stay there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify our continued presence. Once we leave, it's likely to collapse, and it's not worth the cost of staying. So, I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's due to their strict views on certain issues. I'm talking about topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While it's okay that they have strong opinions, some of these views might be seen as outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, I think they'd be less worried about losing followers.\n\nI've heard that many people, including some who were once devoted to the Catholic Church, have begun to disagree with their stance on these matters. This is because their views on issues like abortion and gay marriage might not align with the values of some individuals. As a result, people are starting to question the Church's stance and might feel that their views are outdated.\n\nTake the issue of abortion, for instance. If you're in favor of it, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community where it's strongly discouraged. The same goes for gay marriage – if you believe in it or support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's not like having a family or personal life would distract them from their devotion to God. The Church already says that priests are married to God, so why can't they have a family and dedicated relationships like everyone else in the world? It just doesn't make sense to me.",
            "Honestly, I don't have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose consciously, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. I believe it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. \n\nTo me, it seems that people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I was born straight and another person might be born gay. It's not something they can control or make a conscious decision about. It doesn't seem right to hold them responsible for something that's not their choice. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue at all. It's a personal matter that's not a security threat or a moral concern, but rather a matter of individual rights. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives or dictate who they can love. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nI'm not sure how to put it exactly, but it just seems like a matter of treating everyone with respect and equality, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think the federal government has a right to interject in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as love and relationships. \n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason not to. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. It's a completely different situation, with a multitude of factors that make it in no way comparable. It's like two sides of the same coin; you can't have heads without tails. A gay couple's relationship is built on the same fundamental aspects as a heterosexual one, with the same potential for success and satisfaction.\n\nThe issue is that same-sex couples often face unfair treatment under the law. For example, a partner may not be allowed to be with their sick loved one in the hospital or visit them because they're not considered family. This is illogical, especially considering that these couples are committed to each other for life. Studies have shown that same-sex relationships have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones, with the same factors contributing to happiness.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many couples have the same roles in their relationships, and the only difference is the sex of the partners.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, such as how a gay couple will affect their neighborhood and their children's well-being. However, these concerns are unfounded. Children of same-sex couples are no different from those of heterosexual couples; they have the same potential for success and happiness, and their parents' sexual orientation has no bearing on their upbringing.\n\nIn fact, many communities, like New York City, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and persecution in public schools. This is unacceptable. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about their love and ability to care for their children. \n\nI believe the federal government should play a significant role in making gay marriage legal across the country. The current amendment is misguided, and it's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on an entire nation, especially when it conflicts with the values of other groups. We should focus on what's fair and just, rather than what some people believe is morally right.\n\nSome people oppose gay marriage because they think gay individuals are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has stated that this is not true. We should rely on scientific research and studies, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, to understand this issue.",
            "Listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer and I wanted to share some thoughts on this. Just because a drug is considered illicit doesn't mean it's completely without benefits. I'm not saying we should make it accessible to the public, no way, not at all. However, I do think it has potential for medicinal use. It's a common misconception that just because a drug is banned, it's not beneficial. I think that's what I'm trying to get at.\n\nYeah, let me put it another way. There are plenty of controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them because they have proven benefits, even if they're not widely accepted. So, why can't the same be said for marijuana? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than the taboo surrounding it.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that comparable to alcohol. While abusing marijuana can have negative effects, so can alcohol. It's a delicate issue, but I think if we approach it carefully, we could make it work. Maybe we could regulate its use gradually, rather than making it completely legal all at once. That way, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nPeople often have a skewed view of marijuana because it's been labeled as an illicit substance. But in reality, it's not as bad as some other drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's perception of it, they might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I've been thinking about how the church has adapted to the 21st century, and it's clear that it's not as strict as it used to be. I'm not saying this as a bad thing; it's actually quite refreshing. I remember my childhood, where I'd attend church every Sunday, looking forward to seeing my friends from private school and dressing up in my favorite outfits. It was a big deal, I'd pick out a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse that complemented everything. But as I grew older, I noticed a change. They introduced a more casual, 30-minute mass, especially during the summer. People would walk in straight from the beach, and families would rush in late. Even during morning masses, where I'd always try to look polished, people started wearing jeans and khakis. It's not a bad thing; it's just a more relaxed atmosphere. The only thing I've noticed is that the church has become more laid-back. I don't know the inner workings of the church, but that's my observation.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have a problem with pedophilia, so it's not a matter of being allowed to get married or not. When someone decides to become a priest, it's a personal choice, and they're aware of their desires. Some other religions allow their clergy to be married, like Seventh-day Adventists, for example. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might consider a different faith. I think the issue is more complex than a simple solution like changing the rules.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their environment. While upbringing might play a small role, I believe it's mostly innate. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and tried to cover them up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they were aware of everything. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments at this time.",
            "(laughs) Initially, I was somewhat okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went to Iraq as a pretext, following other factors that led to the invasion. I think the Bush administration hastily connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. That really got under my skin, and the Iraq war still really bothers me.\n\nTo be honest, it seems to me that the Bush administration was dishonest with the American people and has yet to acknowledge this fact. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by it at the time. That's a serious breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to deceive the public like that. The Bush administration appears to have disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since September 11th, at least. I believe they had a preconceived intention to go to war when they took office.\n\nThat last part reminds me of the treasury secretary who wrote in his book that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration, and was also hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run - a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nIn my opinion, it's gone on long enough. Withdrawing our troops now would likely lead to problems, as there's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and more people would die. The alternative seems to be a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either, as it could create long-term problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing its job, according to news reports. The Prime Minister has little control, and even Mugtada al-Sadr's party, which we were fighting just a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in Parliament. This is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nI don't have any suggestions for a solution that I can discuss in polite company.",
            "I'm going to try to articulate my thoughts on the War in Iraq, but I'm not entirely sure where to start. I guess it's because I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but at this point, it feels like we're staying there for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It gets down to building a democracy, but that's a long-term goal that might take forever, and in the meantime, it's just causing a lot of tension. It's hard to see how this is going to play out, and I'm not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind is that this whole thing shouldn't have been called a war in the first place, since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a key point, and it's something to consider. I'm not sure why we're still trying to stay involved, especially when it's causing so much distress both here and in Iraq. It feels like we're just trying to show off our strength, but at what cost?\n\nI've been thinking a lot about this and it's really hard for me to take a clear stance. On one hand, I feel bad for the families of soldiers who are over there, and I don't want to see them get hurt. On the other hand, I'm worried that we're causing more harm by staying there, trying to impose our values on a culture that's so different from ours. It's a delicate balance, and I'm not sure what the right answer is.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think this war is going to be resolved anytime soon. It's going to take years, and it's going to be a long and complicated process. I just wish we could find a way to move forward in a way that's less destructive and more beneficial to everyone involved.",
            "I'm not sure I agree with making it legal or illegal, as it's really a matter for the churches to decide. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be against what's already been said and written. It seems like those trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another, like how most Catholics and Christians are against it except in some areas. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can or can't make illegal. The separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the US. Even considering an amendment would be contradictory to what's already been written and would restrict people's rights rather than the government's.\n\nI'm not sure why the government is getting involved in this issue, considering it's against the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. It feels like his push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's really up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There doesn't seem to be a valid reason for the amendment, except for personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive effect on society. I think I've already covered my points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "I'd like to start by saying that I think the US government wasn't entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons behind the war in Iraq.  I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they didn't have a direct connection. This played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the traumatic events of 2001, and the invasion began in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the Iraq war is eerily similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. We lost a tremendous number of American soldiers, and it's horrible. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but they didn't have a plan for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum and chaos in its wake. The US is still trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, where they tried to push out Communists and implement democracy. However, we should have known it wouldn't be a straightforward victory, and that the outcome would be far from clear-cut.\n\nWe're dealing with a situation where we're fighting the citizens of the country, not a traditional army, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency. I think the government was underprepared for the complexities of the situation and didn't plan for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq, and it's almost 2007, with many American troops still dying and struggling to train the Iraqi security forces. I believe the US government was trying to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. However, establishing a new government takes years, and we shouldn't have been so naive about it.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and difficult struggle, with many civil wars and power struggles. It's not an easy thing to implement, and I think the government made it seem like a relatively easy feat. The decision to go to war in Iraq is a tough one, and I had similar doubts during the 2004 presidential election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was that he should finish what he started, but now I'm not so sure. It's hard to abandon the people we've gotten involved with, especially after taking away their government and way of life. On the other hand, we can't ignore the high number of American casualties and the risks we're taking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe reason we're only focusing on Iraq is likely because of the oil issue and control of resources. Before invading, we claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We're not taking the same action against countries like North Korea, which actually has these weapons. I don't think the US government is thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making process. I just hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm afraid that's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, I'm thinking, and I'm coming to the realization that I'm definitely for gay marriage. This has been my stance for a while now, and the more I learn, the more I believe that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to withhold rights from individuals based on something they can't control.\n\nTo me, this is a personal issue, not something that governments or politics should be involved in, especially at the state or federal level. I know people in my neighborhood who are openly gay, and they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, contribute to the community, and deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else.\n\nIt's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to redefine the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda. I've read and learned from various sources that there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nUltimately, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not something that's scrutinized and sensationalized by the media. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it quietly, without anyone's knowledge or approval. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's front-page news – it's just not fair.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it becomes a public forum available to everyone. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Once you put something out there, it can color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably bring it up. You can't share that kind of information publicly because the internet reaches a huge audience, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they'll likely receive that post. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in that situation, but rather an individual who took it to the school. They had to act on it because they couldn't just ignore it in case something serious did happen and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's also hard to know what to take seriously because some people just joke around online. It's like that situation we had at school where someone might have been doing an experiment for a sociology class that went wrong, or it could be a very serious issue. What happened was that someone overheard a statement made in school and reported it, and when we found out who made the comment, we looked into their online profiles, specifically Facebook, where we found some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke, but became serious in the context. \n\nWhen you put things online, there's no invasion of privacy involved. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they interpret your words. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media and snoop through their profiles, but if someone brings it to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because you gave them access by being friends. If there's a danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also think it's not right for teachers to create fake social media profiles to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to be aware of their personal lives, especially when they're posting photos that might get me involved. I don't think it's my place to know that.",
            "I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At first, I believed the purpose was noble, aimed at restoring democracy in another nation. However, it seems we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of it, almost as a way to prove our power on the global stage. I'm starting to think the original motivations were questionable, particularly considering the previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein that George Bush's father was involved in.\n\nIf our initial intention was truly to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, then that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if personal interests weren't involved. In my opinion, the war has gone on for far too long. I believe we made our point within the first few months, with the initial invasion serving as a powerful statement. But with it now stretching into years, I think it's become a drawn-out conflict.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a valid reason for the war. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, it seems we're still fighting mainly because we want to prove our determination to see it through, rather than achieving a decisive victory. I believe it's time to bring this war to an end.\n\nI think the conflict has gone on long enough, and it's time for the country's government to take responsibility for their own affairs. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. Meanwhile, we have our own internal problems, such as poverty and underfunded public services, that we should be addressing. The money spent on this war could be better used to improve our own country's infrastructure, healthcare, and education.\n\nI think we've reached a point where we need to re-evaluate our priorities. We have citizens back home who are suffering, and the money being spent on this war could be better spent on their welfare. It's time for us to reassess our involvement and bring this war to a close.",
            "Hey, I was wondering if I could clarify something. You see, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue. I think it's fair to say that when you put information on the internet, you're basically making it available for anyone to see. On sites like Myspace, for instance, if you're friends with someone, they can view your profile, and that's just how it works. I mean, if you've accepted someone as your friend on Myspace, you're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nI think that's a good thing, actually - that someone was able to notice the issue and step in. However, it's a bit complicated because schools can't really have someone monitoring students' profiles all the time to prevent problems. It's not practical, and it raises questions of fairness, like why would they single out certain students? I'm not sure it's right to have someone's job be to snoop through people's profiles.\n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just browsing profiles randomly, or was there a specific reason they were looking for something? I'm not really sure. I personally have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this documentary once about a guy who was trying to prove how easy it is to get information from people online. He got a girl's screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger - pretty creepy stuff.\n\nI've had people in my classes who I don't know, and they IM me, which is a bit unsettling. They can figure out a lot about you if you post enough information online, like your photos, class schedule, and friend list. It's a tricky balance between sharing enough to stay in touch with friends and keeping your personal stuff private. I only accept people I know on my social media, but you can never really know who's looking at your stuff.\n\nI remember hearing that my roommate's high school had a thing where students were banned from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It's a bit of a gray area, to be honest.",
            "I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War now. I mean, I've changed my mind on the matter. What really matters isn't whether I was against it from the start or not. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, and it's hard to deny that when you look at the polls. From the US to Iraq and even globally, around 75 to 80% of the population thinks it was a mistake. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops serving there believe it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure what to say, but it's clear that the situation has been disastrous from the start. It was a disaster before we invaded, and now pulling out will be difficult too. The culture clash between the US and Middle Eastern countries is massive, and I don't think we can just impose our system on them. I mean, we can't expect them to adopt democracy when it's not their choice. I'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. I just don't see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for why we should stay, but I haven't been convinced. I'd be okay with a gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's interesting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, shouldn't we listen to their opinions? If they tell us to leave, and something goes wrong, we can say we were trying to follow their lead. That way, we'll at least be the good guys, even if it's not that simple in the Middle East. Anyway, I guess that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "You brought up a really valid point about gender discrimination in the United States. I definitely think it's still an issue, and I'm not just talking about women. I think it's more about the specific industry you're in, as well. I mean, in general, women still face more obstacles, like the \"glass ceiling\" where people struggle to find opportunities to work under a female leader, even when they have the qualifications for the job. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long.\n\nIt's not just women, though; men face similar challenges in certain industries, like fashion or childcare. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and care for the kids, as if it's not a traditional role for them. They might even get judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men might be taken less seriously if they're straight, simply because people assume they don't know what fashion is about.\n\nIt's all about how society has these preconceived notions, and it's hard to change that. We've made progress, but it's slow. As more women take on leadership roles and become CEOs, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, people are starting to see things from a different perspective. But it's not just about forcing change; we need to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If we push too hard, people will resist. We're at a good point now, where change is happening gradually, and I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that isn't already being done.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, accent, or education level, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent. So, it's not just about gender; it's about how society views different groups of people.",
            "To be honest, I think decriminalizing marijuana simply means it's no longer considered a crime, but rather a minor offense, like a traffic ticket. You get cited and don't have to go through the hassle of an arrest and all that comes with it. That being said, the consequences still linger, especially when it comes to things like job interviews and other serious aspects of life. Even with decriminalization, people still worry about the long-term effects, and that doesn't just disappear.\n\nOn the other hand, it's argued that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is costly. Think about it – you've got the costs of arresting, booking, and housing them, plus the expense of multiple court appearances, public defenders, judges, and prosecutors. When you're dealing with financially struggling municipalities, some places just can't afford to make that leap, even if it would free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless.\n\nDenver, being a more open-minded city, has taken a different approach. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've actually been able to allocate more funds to valuable community programs. It's not just about being permissive; it's about being responsible and making smart financial decisions.\n\nHowever, there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of complete legalization. If it were like cigarettes, you'd have people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many places. It's a complex issue, and opinions vary widely. Some might say it's awkward to have it out in the open, while others might argue it's better to be upfront about it.\n\nPersonally, I think marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles than just their motor skills, but it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. People react differently to substances, and some can handle them better than others. It's hard to generalize, but I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree to the idea because of a few reasons. Many of their customs are deeply rooted in tradition, which has been the case for a long time. On one hand, sticking to tradition is a good thing, but on the other hand, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I think it's a bit hypocritical that some Catholics expect people to follow their doctrine to the letter but are not open to those who don't fit the mold. For instance, my parents, both from different faiths, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background.\n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church preaches love and acceptance, but it doesn't always practice what it preaches. They claim to teach love for others, but they don't always put this into action when it comes to people from different faiths. I feel like the doctrine and practice don't always align because it's become outdated, but they still stick to it anyway.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in the way some priests behave. I think that people who have a history of child abuse would likely do so regardless of whether they're married or not. Being married is not a barrier to such behavior, as it's a much more complex issue. Allowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents from occurring.\n\nBut let's focus on the positive aspects. There are some good things about the Catholic Church, and I think it would be beneficial to adapt to some of these changes.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet. I'm not sure if either side is right or wrong, but I do think this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with today. The line between separating church and state, and how we define marriage is a delicate one, and it's hard to tackle without causing offense.\n\nTo be honest, I'm torn on this one - I'm not sure if marriage should be viewed as a civil union or something more. Given that it's considered a sacrament by some, it's tricky to decide how the government should look at it. If people are baptized, they often get special tax breaks or other benefits, so I think the government should treat all unions as civil unions, regardless of their church ties. It's just about two people coming together, and the government shouldn't get involved in the details of their relationship.\n\nI also think that if we can reach a logical conclusion on this issue at a state level, it should be made into a federal law. However, pushing for a constitutional amendment just to ban gay marriage seems extreme - the constitution shouldn't be changed for something that's not a major issue. It's just not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nTo me, it's as simple as that - we shouldn't amend the constitution to define marriage or ban gay marriage. It's a matter of personal choice, and the government shouldn't interfere.",
            "To be honest, I grew up in a Christian household, which created a bit of confusion for me when it comes to homosexuality. Having close gay friends has made me think about this issue more, and while I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue that the president should decide on, but rather something that individual states should have control over.\n\nI know that many states are divided in their views, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you're living in a state that's already leaning towards accepting gay marriage, it's hard to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to make that place your home. I genuinely believe that everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not right for the president to dictate how the entire country should feel about gay marriage. George Bush, in particular, shouldn't have the authority to ban it nationwide, as he doesn't live in every state. That decision should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves. With Bush's term ending in a couple of years, I think it's just a waste of time for him to take a stance on this issue, as future presidents could just reverse his decision. Ultimately, it's the states that will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president.\n\nMy answer is clear: no, I don't think the president should have the power to decide on this issue for the whole country.",
            "Honestly, I just don't get it. Let me try to break it down. MySpace is essentially a public platform, like a bulletin board where you share things for others to see. If you post something online, it's out there for anyone to see, including school officials, not just those who access it directly through the school's account. Even if it's not under the school's name, they can still find it from their homes. So, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent something like a school shooting and saves students' lives - which is a school's responsibility - then I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to see if students are engaging in prohibited activities. I think that's an invasion of privacy, but if it leads to a safer school environment, I'm okay with it. If it's about keeping students safe, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nTo be honest, it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing rather than speaking. What I'm trying to say is that if a student posts something on Myspace and expects not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Posting something online means it's out there forever, and you never know who might see it. Even emails can come back to haunt you, and once something's on the internet, it's there to stay.\n\nIf you do something as a college student and it gets discovered later, it can cause trouble. It's not an invasion of privacy if you post something publicly. I've said it before: it's a public platform, so if officials use it to keep the school safe, I think that's fine. If they have a legitimate reason to investigate, like preventing a school shooting, then I'm okay with it.\n\nIn fact, my old teacher told me that schools have to ensure they do things like lock downs to keep students safe. It's not just about school shootings; it's about being prepared for any emergency. Even though it might seem unrelated, it's all about keeping the school safe. The school officials were just doing their job by monitoring Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like another Columbine. That's about it.",
            "Honestly, I was initially very supportive of going to war after 9/11. I was deeply affected by the event and felt a strong desire for retaliation. However, looking back, I think we rushed into it without a solid plan in place. It was an emotional response rather than a well-thought-out decision. We went in unprepared and without a clear understanding of the long-term consequences.\n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's achieved anything positive. As long as the people in the region are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to target us. It's like fighting a never-ending battle – they can't even agree with each other, let alone with us.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 made me lose interest in what happens over there. I've come to feel that they're more like savages in war, and it's not about improving their country; it's about getting rid of us. I think we should just leave and let them handle their own affairs.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe we were more driven by emotions and a desire for revenge than a rational understanding of the situation. It was a case of seeking revenge rather than solving the underlying issues. President Bush was partly driven by public opinion, and he declared war on Iraq without a clear plan. While I can see where he was coming from, I think we should have been more cautious.\n\nWe had to act after 9/11, but we could have done it in a more thoughtful and strategic way. There was a lack of unity and a clear plan for creating order in Iraq, which made things worse. I don't think we're the ones who can change those people or their ways. They'll always be like that, and it's pointless for us to stay there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify our continued presence. Once we leave, it's likely to collapse, and it's not worth the cost of staying. So, I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's due to their strict views on certain issues. I'm talking about topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While it's okay that they have strong opinions, some of these views might be seen as outdated. If they adapted to a more modern perspective, I think they'd be less worried about losing followers.\n\nI've heard that many people, including some who were once devoted to the Catholic Church, have begun to disagree with their stance on these matters. This is because their views on issues like abortion and gay marriage might not align with the values of some individuals. As a result, people are starting to question the Church's stance and might feel that their views are outdated.\n\nTake the issue of abortion, for instance. If you're in favor of it, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community where it's strongly discouraged. The same goes for gay marriage – if you believe in it or support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's not like having a family or personal life would distract them from their devotion to God. The Church already says that priests are married to God, so why can't they have a family and dedicated relationships like everyone else in the world? It just doesn't make sense to me.",
            "Honestly, I don't have an issue with gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose consciously, so I don't think they should be held accountable for it. I believe it's unfair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. \n\nTo me, it seems that people are born with their sexual orientation, just like I was born straight and another person might be born gay. It's not something they can control or make a conscious decision about. It doesn't seem right to hold them responsible for something that's not their choice. \n\nI think the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue at all. It's a personal matter that's not a security threat or a moral concern, but rather a matter of individual rights. It's not their place to interfere in people's lives or dictate who they can love. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nI'm not sure how to put it exactly, but it just seems like a matter of treating everyone with respect and equality, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think the federal government has a right to interject in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as love and relationships. \n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason not to. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. It's a completely different situation, with a multitude of factors that make it in no way comparable. It's like two sides of the same coin; you can't have heads without tails. A gay couple's relationship is built on the same fundamental aspects as a heterosexual one, with the same potential for success and satisfaction.\n\nThe issue is that same-sex couples often face unfair treatment under the law. For example, a partner may not be allowed to be with their sick loved one in the hospital or visit them because they're not considered family. This is illogical, especially considering that these couples are committed to each other for life. Studies have shown that same-sex relationships have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones, with the same factors contributing to happiness.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many couples have the same roles in their relationships, and the only difference is the sex of the partners.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, such as how a gay couple will affect their neighborhood and their children's well-being. However, these concerns are unfounded. Children of same-sex couples are no different from those of heterosexual couples; they have the same potential for success and happiness, and their parents' sexual orientation has no bearing on their upbringing.\n\nIn fact, many communities, like New York City, have special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and persecution in public schools. This is unacceptable. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about their love and ability to care for their children. \n\nI believe the federal government should play a significant role in making gay marriage legal across the country. The current amendment is misguided, and it's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on an entire nation, especially when it conflicts with the values of other groups. We should focus on what's fair and just, rather than what some people believe is morally right.\n\nSome people oppose gay marriage because they think gay individuals are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has stated that this is not true. We should rely on scientific research and studies, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, to understand this issue.",
            "Listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer and I wanted to share some thoughts on this. Just because a drug is considered illicit doesn't mean it's completely without benefits. I'm not saying we should make it accessible to the public, no way, not at all. However, I do think it has potential for medicinal use. It's a common misconception that just because a drug is banned, it's not beneficial. I think that's what I'm trying to get at.\n\nYeah, let me put it another way. There are plenty of controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. We use them because they have proven benefits, even if they're not widely accepted. So, why can't the same be said for marijuana? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than the taboo surrounding it.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that comparable to alcohol. While abusing marijuana can have negative effects, so can alcohol. It's a delicate issue, but I think if we approach it carefully, we could make it work. Maybe we could regulate its use gradually, rather than making it completely legal all at once. That way, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nPeople often have a skewed view of marijuana because it's been labeled as an illicit substance. But in reality, it's not as bad as some other drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's perception of it, they might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I've been thinking about how the church has adapted to the 21st century, and it's clear that it's not as strict as it used to be. I'm not saying this as a bad thing; it's actually quite refreshing. I remember my childhood, where I'd attend church every Sunday, looking forward to seeing my friends from private school and dressing up in my favorite outfits. It was a big deal, I'd pick out a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse that complemented everything. But as I grew older, I noticed a change. They introduced a more casual, 30-minute mass, especially during the summer. People would walk in straight from the beach, and families would rush in late. Even during morning masses, where I'd always try to look polished, people started wearing jeans and khakis. It's not a bad thing; it's just a more relaxed atmosphere. The only thing I've noticed is that the church has become more laid-back. I don't know the inner workings of the church, but that's my observation.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have a problem with pedophilia, so it's not a matter of being allowed to get married or not. When someone decides to become a priest, it's a personal choice, and they're aware of their desires. Some other religions allow their clergy to be married, like Seventh-day Adventists, for example. If someone wants to be a priest and get married, they might consider a different faith. I think the issue is more complex than a simple solution like changing the rules.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their environment. While upbringing might play a small role, I believe it's mostly innate. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and tried to cover them up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they were aware of everything. As for other thoughts about the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments at this time.",
            "(laughs) Initially, I was somewhat okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I believe we went to Iraq as a pretext, following other factors that led to the invasion. I think the Bush administration hastily connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. That really got under my skin, and the Iraq war still really bothers me.\n\nTo be honest, it seems to me that the Bush administration was dishonest with the American people and has yet to acknowledge this fact. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by it at the time. That's a serious breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to deceive the public like that. The Bush administration appears to have disregarded the constitution and has been working to undermine it since September 11th, at least. I believe they had a preconceived intention to go to war when they took office.\n\nThat last part reminds me of the treasury secretary who wrote in his book that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration, and was also hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run - a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nIn my opinion, it's gone on long enough. Withdrawing our troops now would likely lead to problems, as there's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and more people would die. The alternative seems to be a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either, as it could create long-term problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing its job, according to news reports. The Prime Minister has little control, and even Mugtada al-Sadr's party, which we were fighting just a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in Parliament. This is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nI don't have any suggestions for a solution that I can discuss in polite company.",
            "I'm going to try to articulate my thoughts on the War in Iraq, but I'm not entirely sure where to start. I guess it's because I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but at this point, it feels like we're staying there for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It gets down to building a democracy, but that's a long-term goal that might take forever, and in the meantime, it's just causing a lot of tension. It's hard to see how this is going to play out, and I'm not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind is that this whole thing shouldn't have been called a war in the first place, since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a key point, and it's something to consider. I'm not sure why we're still trying to stay involved, especially when it's causing so much distress both here and in Iraq. It feels like we're just trying to show off our strength, but at what cost?\n\nI've been thinking a lot about this and it's really hard for me to take a clear stance. On one hand, I feel bad for the families of soldiers who are over there, and I don't want to see them get hurt. On the other hand, I'm worried that we're causing more harm by staying there, trying to impose our values on a culture that's so different from ours. It's a delicate balance, and I'm not sure what the right answer is.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think this war is going to be resolved anytime soon. It's going to take years, and it's going to be a long and complicated process. I just wish we could find a way to move forward in a way that's less destructive and more beneficial to everyone involved.",
            "I'm not sure I agree with making it legal or illegal, as it's really a matter for the churches to decide. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be against what's already been said and written. It seems like those trying to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another, like how most Catholics and Christians are against it except in some areas. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can or can't make illegal. The separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the US. Even considering an amendment would be contradictory to what's already been written and would restrict people's rights rather than the government's.\n\nI'm not sure why the government is getting involved in this issue, considering it's against the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. It feels like his push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's really up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There doesn't seem to be a valid reason for the amendment, except for personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive effect on society. I think I've already covered my points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "I'd like to start by saying that I think the US government wasn't entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons behind the war in Iraq.  I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they didn't have a direct connection. This played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the traumatic events of 2001, and the invasion began in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the Iraq war is eerily similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. We lost a tremendous number of American soldiers, and it's horrible. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but they didn't have a plan for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum and chaos in its wake. The US is still trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, where they tried to push out Communists and implement democracy. However, we should have known it wouldn't be a straightforward victory, and that the outcome would be far from clear-cut.\n\nWe're dealing with a situation where we're fighting the citizens of the country, not a traditional army, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency. I think the government was underprepared for the complexities of the situation and didn't plan for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq, and it's almost 2007, with many American troops still dying and struggling to train the Iraqi security forces. I believe the US government was trying to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. However, establishing a new government takes years, and we shouldn't have been so naive about it.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and difficult struggle, with many civil wars and power struggles. It's not an easy thing to implement, and I think the government made it seem like a relatively easy feat. The decision to go to war in Iraq is a tough one, and I had similar doubts during the 2004 presidential election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was that he should finish what he started, but now I'm not so sure. It's hard to abandon the people we've gotten involved with, especially after taking away their government and way of life. On the other hand, we can't ignore the high number of American casualties and the risks we're taking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe reason we're only focusing on Iraq is likely because of the oil issue and control of resources. Before invading, we claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We're not taking the same action against countries like North Korea, which actually has these weapons. I don't think the US government is thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making process. I just hope the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm afraid that's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, I'm thinking, and I'm coming to the realization that I'm definitely for gay marriage. This has been my stance for a while now, and the more I learn, the more I believe that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to withhold rights from individuals based on something they can't control.\n\nTo me, this is a personal issue, not something that governments or politics should be involved in, especially at the state or federal level. I know people in my neighborhood who are openly gay, and they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, contribute to the community, and deserve the same rights and recognition as everyone else.\n\nIt's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to redefine the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda. I've read and learned from various sources that there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nUltimately, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not something that's scrutinized and sensationalized by the media. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it quietly, without anyone's knowledge or approval. But if a gay couple wants to get married, it's front-page news – it's just not fair.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it becomes a public forum available to everyone. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Once you put something out there, it can color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably bring it up. You can't share that kind of information publicly because the internet reaches a huge audience, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they'll likely receive that post. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in that situation, but rather an individual who took it to the school. They had to act on it because they couldn't just ignore it in case something serious did happen and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's also hard to know what to take seriously because some people just joke around online. It's like that situation we had at school where someone might have been doing an experiment for a sociology class that went wrong, or it could be a very serious issue. What happened was that someone overheard a statement made in school and reported it, and when we found out who made the comment, we looked into their online profiles, specifically Facebook, where we found some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke, but became serious in the context. \n\nWhen you put things online, there's no invasion of privacy involved. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they interpret your words. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media and snoop through their profiles, but if someone brings it to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because you gave them access by being friends. If there's a danger, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI also think it's not right for teachers to create fake social media profiles to friend their students – it's the same thing. As an R.A., I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to be aware of their personal lives, especially when they're posting photos that might get me involved. I don't think it's my place to know that.",
            "I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At first, I believed the purpose was noble, aimed at restoring democracy in another nation. However, it seems we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of it, almost as a way to prove our power on the global stage. I'm starting to think the original motivations were questionable, particularly considering the previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein that George Bush's father was involved in.\n\nIf our initial intention was truly to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, then that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if personal interests weren't involved. In my opinion, the war has gone on for far too long. I believe we made our point within the first few months, with the initial invasion serving as a powerful statement. But with it now stretching into years, I think it's become a drawn-out conflict.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a valid reason for the war. However, over time, our reasons have become distorted and misconceived, it seems we're still fighting mainly because we want to prove our determination to see it through, rather than achieving a decisive victory. I believe it's time to bring this war to an end.\n\nI think the conflict has gone on long enough, and it's time for the country's government to take responsibility for their own affairs. We've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. Meanwhile, we have our own internal problems, such as poverty and underfunded public services, that we should be addressing. The money spent on this war could be better used to improve our own country's infrastructure, healthcare, and education.\n\nI think we've reached a point where we need to re-evaluate our priorities. We have citizens back home who are suffering, and the money being spent on this war could be better spent on their welfare. It's time for us to reassess our involvement and bring this war to a close.",
            "Hey, I was wondering if I could clarify something. You see, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue. I think it's fair to say that when you put information on the internet, you're basically making it available for anyone to see. On sites like Myspace, for instance, if you're friends with someone, they can view your profile, and that's just how it works. I mean, if you've accepted someone as your friend on Myspace, you're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nI think that's a good thing, actually - that someone was able to notice the issue and step in. However, it's a bit complicated because schools can't really have someone monitoring students' profiles all the time to prevent problems. It's not practical, and it raises questions of fairness, like why would they single out certain students? I'm not sure it's right to have someone's job be to snoop through people's profiles.\n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just browsing profiles randomly, or was there a specific reason they were looking for something? I'm not really sure. I personally have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw this documentary once about a guy who was trying to prove how easy it is to get information from people online. He got a girl's screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger - pretty creepy stuff.\n\nI've had people in my classes who I don't know, and they IM me, which is a bit unsettling. They can figure out a lot about you if you post enough information online, like your photos, class schedule, and friend list. It's a tricky balance between sharing enough to stay in touch with friends and keeping your personal stuff private. I only accept people I know on my social media, but you can never really know who's looking at your stuff.\n\nI remember hearing that my roommate's high school had a thing where students were banned from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students what they could and couldn't do online. It's a bit of a gray area, to be honest.",
            "I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War now. I mean, I've changed my mind on the matter. What really matters isn't whether I was against it from the start or not. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, and it's hard to deny that when you look at the polls. From the US to Iraq and even globally, around 75 to 80% of the population thinks it was a mistake. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops serving there believe it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure what to say, but it's clear that the situation has been disastrous from the start. It was a disaster before we invaded, and now pulling out will be difficult too. The culture clash between the US and Middle Eastern countries is massive, and I don't think we can just impose our system on them. I mean, we can't expect them to adopt democracy when it's not their choice. I'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. I just don't see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for why we should stay, but I haven't been convinced. I'd be okay with a gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more, but I don't see a reason why we can't leave now. It's interesting that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, shouldn't we listen to their opinions? If they tell us to leave, and something goes wrong, we can say we were trying to follow their lead. That way, we'll at least be the good guys, even if it's not that simple in the Middle East. Anyway, I guess that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "You brought up a really valid point about gender discrimination in the United States. I definitely think it's still an issue, and I'm not just talking about women. I think it's more about the specific industry you're in, as well. I mean, in general, women still face more obstacles, like the \"glass ceiling\" where people struggle to find opportunities to work under a female leader, even when they have the qualifications for the job. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long.\n\nIt's not just women, though; men face similar challenges in certain industries, like fashion or childcare. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and care for the kids, as if it's not a traditional role for them. They might even get judged for it. Similarly, in the fashion industry, men might be taken less seriously if they're straight, simply because people assume they don't know what fashion is about.\n\nIt's all about how society has these preconceived notions, and it's hard to change that. We've made progress, but it's slow. As more women take on leadership roles and become CEOs, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, people are starting to see things from a different perspective. But it's not just about forcing change; we need to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If we push too hard, people will resist. We're at a good point now, where change is happening gradually, and I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do that isn't already being done.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, accent, or education level, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might be judged for their grammar, even if they're highly intelligent. So, it's not just about gender; it's about how society views different groups of people.",
            "To be honest, I think decriminalizing marijuana simply means it's no longer considered a crime, but rather a minor offense, like a traffic ticket. You get cited and don't have to go through the hassle of an arrest and all that comes with it. That being said, the consequences still linger, especially when it comes to things like job interviews and other serious aspects of life. Even with decriminalization, people still worry about the long-term effects, and that doesn't just disappear.\n\nOn the other hand, it's argued that arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is costly. Think about it – you've got the costs of arresting, booking, and housing them, plus the expense of multiple court appearances, public defenders, judges, and prosecutors. When you're dealing with financially struggling municipalities, some places just can't afford to make that leap, even if it would free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless.\n\nDenver, being a more open-minded city, has taken a different approach. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've actually been able to allocate more funds to valuable community programs. It's not just about being permissive; it's about being responsible and making smart financial decisions.\n\nHowever, there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of complete legalization. If it were like cigarettes, you'd have people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many places. It's a complex issue, and opinions vary widely. Some might say it's awkward to have it out in the open, while others might argue it's better to be upfront about it.\n\nPersonally, I think marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles than just their motor skills, but it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. People react differently to substances, and some can handle them better than others. It's hard to generalize, but I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects.",
            "I'd agree to the idea because of a few reasons. Many of their customs are deeply rooted in tradition, which has been the case for a long time. On one hand, sticking to tradition is a good thing, but on the other hand, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I think it's a bit hypocritical that some Catholics expect people to follow their doctrine to the letter but are not open to those who don't fit the mold. For instance, my parents, both from different faiths, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background.\n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church preaches love and acceptance, but it doesn't always practice what it preaches. They claim to teach love for others, but they don't always put this into action when it comes to people from different faiths. I feel like the doctrine and practice don't always align because it's become outdated, but they still stick to it anyway.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in the way some priests behave. I think that people who have a history of child abuse would likely do so regardless of whether they're married or not. Being married is not a barrier to such behavior, as it's a much more complex issue. Allowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents from occurring.\n\nBut let's focus on the positive aspects. There are some good things about the Catholic Church, and I think it would be beneficial to adapt to some of these changes.",
            "Honestly, I'm still unsure about this issue, and I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet. I'm not sure if either side is right or wrong, but I do think this is one of the most challenging topics we're dealing with today. The line between separating church and state, and how we define marriage is a delicate one, and it's hard to tackle without causing offense.\n\nTo be honest, I'm torn on this one - I'm not sure if marriage should be viewed as a civil union or something more. Given that it's considered a sacrament by some, it's tricky to decide how the government should look at it. If people are baptized, they often get special tax breaks or other benefits, so I think the government should treat all unions as civil unions, regardless of their church ties. It's just about two people coming together, and the government shouldn't get involved in the details of their relationship.\n\nI also think that if we can reach a logical conclusion on this issue at a state level, it should be made into a federal law. However, pushing for a constitutional amendment just to ban gay marriage seems extreme - the constitution shouldn't be changed for something that's not a major issue. It's just not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nTo me, it's as simple as that - we shouldn't amend the constitution to define marriage or ban gay marriage. It's a matter of personal choice, and the government shouldn't interfere.",
            "To be honest, I grew up in a Christian household, which created a bit of confusion for me when it comes to homosexuality. Having close gay friends has made me think about this issue more, and while I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it's something that should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue that the president should decide on, but rather something that individual states should have control over.\n\nI know that many states are divided in their views, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you're living in a state that's already leaning towards accepting gay marriage, it's hard to disagree with their decision, especially since you chose to make that place your home. I genuinely believe that everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not right for the president to dictate how the entire country should feel about gay marriage. George Bush, in particular, shouldn't have the authority to ban it nationwide, as he doesn't live in every state. That decision should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves. With Bush's term ending in a couple of years, I think it's just a waste of time for him to take a stance on this issue, as future presidents could just reverse his decision. Ultimately, it's the states that will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president.\n\nMy answer is clear: no, I don't think the president should have the power to decide on this issue for the whole country.",
            "Honestly, I just don't get it. Let me try to break it down. MySpace is essentially a public platform, like a bulletin board where you share things for others to see. If you post something online, it's out there for anyone to see, including school officials, not just those who access it directly through the school's account. Even if it's not under the school's name, they can still find it from their homes. So, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent something like a school shooting and saves students' lives - which is a school's responsibility - then I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when school officials check Myspace to see if students are engaging in prohibited activities. I think that's an invasion of privacy, but if it leads to a safer school environment, I'm okay with it. If it's about keeping students safe, I don't consider it an invasion at all.\n\nTo be honest, it's a lot easier to express myself when I'm writing rather than speaking. What I'm trying to say is that if a student posts something on Myspace and expects not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Posting something online means it's out there forever, and you never know who might see it. Even emails can come back to haunt you, and once something's on the internet, it's there to stay.\n\nIf you do something as a college student and it gets discovered later, it can cause trouble. It's not an invasion of privacy if you post something publicly. I've said it before: it's a public platform, so if officials use it to keep the school safe, I think that's fine. If they have a legitimate reason to investigate, like preventing a school shooting, then I'm okay with it.\n\nIn fact, my old teacher told me that schools have to ensure they do things like lock downs to keep students safe. It's not just about school shootings; it's about being prepared for any emergency. Even though it might seem unrelated, it's all about keeping the school safe. The school officials were just doing their job by monitoring Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like another Columbine. That's about it.",
            "Honestly, I was initially very supportive of going to war after 9/11. I was deeply affected by the event and felt a strong desire for retaliation. However, looking back, I think we rushed into it without a solid plan in place. It was an emotional response rather than a well-thought-out decision. We went in unprepared and without a clear understanding of the long-term consequences.\n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's achieved anything positive. As long as the people in the region are fighting among themselves, they won't be able to target us. It's like fighting a never-ending battle – they can't even agree with each other, let alone with us.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 made me lose interest in what happens over there. I've come to feel that they're more like savages in war, and it's not about improving their country; it's about getting rid of us. I think we should just leave and let them handle their own affairs.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe we were more driven by emotions and a desire for revenge than a rational understanding of the situation. It was a case of seeking revenge rather than solving the underlying issues. President Bush was partly driven by public opinion, and he declared war on Iraq without a clear plan. While I can see where he was coming from, I think we should have been more cautious.\n\nWe had to act after 9/11, but we could have done it in a more thoughtful and strategic way. There was a lack of unity and a clear plan for creating order in Iraq, which made things worse. I don't think we're the ones who can change those people or their ways. They'll always be like that, and it's pointless for us to stay there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify our continued presence. Once we leave, it's likely to collapse, and it's not worth the cost of staying. So, I think we're only hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq."
