            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some significant changes. They're losing followers, and it's largely because they're not very accepting of many things. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control is really outdated. While I understand that they have strong views on these topics, I believe that if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to reject the Church's views on these issues, and it's causing a lot of people to turn against them.\n\nIf you're someone who supports abortion or gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a community where these things are viewed as completely wrong. It's the same with other issues – if the Church doesn't agree with your values, you might not want to be part of their community. It's hard to see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think it would have prevented the problems, but it might have made a difference.\n\nI don't get why priests can't have families or lead a normal life outside of their devotion to God. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but so are many other people who have jobs and families. It's not like they're asking for a complete separation from the world; they just want to balance their work and personal life.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, being gay isn't something people choose consciously, so it's not fair to hold them accountable for it. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice they make, and I don't think it's right to punish someone for how they're born. I haven't really thought deeply about this topic, but it seems pretty clear to me that it's wrong to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's not like being gay is something people choose; they're just born that way. I mean, just like I was born straight, and that's not something I consciously chose. It's not fair to hold them responsible for something that's not in their control. I think it's wrong to put people on a pedestal, judging them for being gay.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral values. They're overstepping their boundaries and imposing their opinions on people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nIt's pretty simple: if being gay isn't a choice, then why should the government have the right to intervene? It's not their place to dictate how people live their lives or who they love. I just don't think it's right to punish people for being themselves.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The thing is, there's really no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's a completely different situation, and there are so many nuances to it that make it hard to compare the two. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing - they're not.\n\nWhen it comes to civil rights, gay couples are often left out. For example, when you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be by your side in the hospital or visit you because they're not considered family. That just doesn't seem fair, especially when you're committed to spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. Where people get hung up is when they think that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church. But what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships. People worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are just excuses. What about children of gay couples? Can they really be any different from children of straight couples? In many places, like New York City, kids of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in public schools.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now. President Bush has strong views on gay marriage, but they're based on his personal beliefs, not fact. And let's be honest, morality is subjective and differs from person to person. To impose one group's morality on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they think being gay is a choice or a personality defect, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth, and it's time we listened to the experts, not our neighbors or popular opinion.",
            "So, I wanted to share something with you about my job at the hospital pharmacy over the summer. Just because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it has no therapeutic benefits. In fact, if we're talking about making it available to the public, I firmly believe the answer is no - absolutely not. However, if we're discussing its potential use for medicinal purposes, then yes, I think it's definitely worth considering. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of illicit substances that we use in pharmacies all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. These are controlled substances, but we use them because they have benefits and if we dismiss those benefits just because there's a stigma around marijuana, then I don't think that makes sense. \n\nI also don't think marijuana is comparable to alcohol, at least in terms of its potential for abuse. If you misuse alcohol, it can lead to serious issues, but the same thing can happen with marijuana. However, I do think it's worth integrating it into society gradually, rather than suddenly legalizing it. This way, people might learn to use it responsibly. \n\nOne of the main reasons people have a negative perception of marijuana is that it's illegal. But let's be real, it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could break down that image and show that marijuana is not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be, then people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday, get all dressed up, and see my friends from private school. However, now they've introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress way more casually. You'd see people coming in their beach clothes straight from the beach, even during the morning masses where everyone used to dress up. It's become a lot more relaxed. \n\nOne thing that really stands out to me is the change in dress code. People used to dress up, now they wear jeans or khakis. It's not a bad thing, it's just more casual. As for the church's inner workings, I'm not really aware of that, but I guess that's what it is now.\n\nRegarding the recent scandals about the Catholic church and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who are married and still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not about being allowed to get married or not. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and I think that's a big part of the problem. \n\nI mean, there are other religions that allow priests to be married, like Seventh Heaven, and their priests are still reverends or ministers. If someone really wants to practice their faith and get married, then they might want to look into a different faith. I think the root of the problem is more genetic, and people are born with these tendencies. You can't change that through marriage, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, then that's a whole different story, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.\n\nI don't have much else to say about the Catholic church, but I do think it's worth noting that if they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's shameful.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. It seemed like we went to war in Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which was later proven to be false. This really got under my skin. I think the Bush administration was openly deceiving the American people, and despite the evidence, they've never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced of the evidence at the time. That raises serious questions about the administration's integrity and their disregard for the constitution. It seems they've been trying to erode it since 9/11. \n\nI believe they came into office with the intention of going to war. A former treasury secretary mentioned this in his book, suggesting that President Bush was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein, which was also motivated by his father's administration. This was an underhanded way to achieve their goals.\n\nI think it's time we moved on from this conflict, but withdrawing now would likely lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order, also raises concerns. I'm not convinced this will work in the long run because it'll raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of their government. The news reports indicate that the interim government is struggling, the parliament is ineffective, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a complex and fractious situation, and I'm not sure how to articulate my concerns in a polite way.",
            "I've been thinking more about the war in Iraq, and I have to admit, it's been a bit of a struggle for me to keep up with everything. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, right? It feels like we went into it as a way to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks, but that's just my opinion. To be honest, I'm not really well-versed on the details, but I know we're trying to establish a democracy there, which seems like a great goal, but it's a long process. And now, it's like we're staying for oil and resources too. That's just not a good enough reason to keep it going when it's causing so much distress. It's a tough spot, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.\n\nOn one hand, I feel like we should keep trying to help them build a democracy, but on the other hand, it's like we're trying to impose our own values and systems on them, which could make things worse. And with the way things are going, it's hard to see a clear end in sight. I'm worried that if we stay, we'll just be prolonging the suffering and creating more hatred towards the US. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I know it's not going to be easy.\n\nI do think that we shouldn't call it a war anymore, though. I mean, we didn't declare it as a war through Congress, so it's not really a declared war, is it? And that's how it should be done, right? It's all just a big mess, and I'm not sure what the best way forward is.\n\nIt's hard for me because I know people I care about have family members over there, and it's tough to see them having to deal with all this. But at the same time, I feel like we're kind of destroying their lives and their culture. I'm not sure what the right thing to do is, but I know it's not going to be simple.",
            "Honestly, I have my doubts about it being right for a state to make it legal. I believe it's more the church's decision, considering the constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's explicitly mentioned, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established. \n\nI think it's not just about one particular set of people trying to make it illegal, but more about picking and choosing which church's beliefs to support over others. As we can see, many Catholics and Christians are against it, but it's not a unified stance across the board. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't enforce.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend it would be contradictory to what's already been written and could essentially restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should stay out of this issue. I'm not sure why there's a push for an amendment, except that it aligns with the president's personal Catholic beliefs. This shows that he's favoring one religion over others, which I don't think is right. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There's no concrete reason for the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have a significant impact on the economy. \n\nIf anything, it might have a positive effect on society. I think I've covered all my points.",
            "Let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government was not entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. They tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not that straightforward. The government capitalized on the public's outrage after 9/11 to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I've always been against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. In many ways, the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should've learned from its past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is heartbreaking.\n\nThe US government made a serious mistake by removing Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath. They tried to implant a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they didn't consider the long-term consequences. It's not an easy process to establish a stable democracy, and it's unrealistic to expect it to happen quickly. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and challenging process.\n\nOne of the main issues is that the US got involved in a war without being prepared for the outcome. They're still in Iraq in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. The situation is a long way from being resolved, and it's clear that the US government wasn't prepared for the void of power and chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nIt's hard to justify the continued involvement in Iraq when the government's initial reasons for going to war, such as the presence of WMDs, were proven false. North Korea, which actually had WMDs, didn't face the same level of aggression. It's clear that the US government is prioritizing its own interests, particularly access to oil resources, over the well-being of the people in Iraq.\n\nIt's difficult to make a decision on what to do next, but I hope that the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. However, given the current situation, it's hard to be optimistic.",
            "Well, let me think for a moment. I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage, and I've always been that way. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and something that's increasingly being shown to be influenced by biology rather than social factors. It's unfair to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control. I'm a firm supporter of gay marriage, and I think it's inhumane to discriminate against individuals in this way.\n\nIn my opinion, governments and politics shouldn't interfere with this issue at all. It's a personal and private matter, not something that should be decided at the state or national level. I've seen it firsthand in my own community - there are openly gay couples living just like any other family, taking care of their daily responsibilities and living their lives without any issues. It's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to impose his own interpretation of marriage on the rest of us.\n\nI've done some research, and it seems that there's a growing understanding that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. So, it's not necessarily something that's chosen, but rather something people are born with.\n\nTo me, the fact that straight couples can get married in secret without any fuss, but gay couples are put under a microscope, is a huge issue. It's something that should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle. I think it's time we treat all couples equally and respect their right to love and marry whoever they choose.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's essentially a public declaration. It's out there for anyone to see, and you can't take it back. As someone who's dealt with this in my role as an R.A., it's a reality you have to face. What you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or extreme actions, someone's bound to take notice and share it. The internet is a global platform, and if you're connected to someone who receives that bulletin, they might react. Schools, for instance, can't ignore these warnings; they have to act on them to ensure everyone's safety. However, it's also challenging to discern what's serious and what's just a joke, especially when we've seen cases like the one that happened at our school, which could have been a twisted social experiment gone wrong. In this particular instance, someone overheard a comment and reported it to the school after researching the individual's online presence. They found concerning content that, in hindsight, was meant as a joke but took on a serious tone in the context. When you put something online, you lose control over who sees it and what they make of it. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't dictate how people perceive you or what they take seriously. Schools shouldn't be monitoring students' online activities, but if concerns are raised, they do have a responsibility to investigate. It's a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety. I think school officials should focus on addressing issues raised by students, rather than actively searching for information. But if concerns are brought to their attention, they should take them seriously and act accordingly.",
            "I'm getting the feeling that the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble cause. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. It now feels like we're fighting just for the sake of it, to prove our military might, rather than for the original reason. I'm also concerned that the underlying motivations might have been questionable from the start, considering the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country with no fair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if there were no personal interests involved. Unfortunately, I think our purpose has been distorted over time. I believe we made our point with the initial invasion, which was a significant statement in itself. However, the fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, maybe even years, is just too long.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a legitimate reason for war, but I don't think that's our reason anymore. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, to avoid losing face or to claim a decisive victory. I genuinely think it's time to bring this to an end.\n\nI believe it's been long enough for the local government to take responsibility for themselves. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be better spent on our own pressing issues like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. It's like we're sacrificing our own citizens for a cause that's been lost. Our economy is being drained, and I think it's time to stop this unnecessary expenditure.\n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal improvements. The money being spent on this war could be better spent on our own citizens' welfare. It's a shame that our own people are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer valid.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I had a thought and I wanted to clarify it.  It was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue.  I think it's fair to say that when you post information online, like on Myspace, you have to know that lots of people can see it.  Even though you have to accept someone as a friend before they can view your profile, you're essentially giving them permission to see it.  It's like this whenever you put anything online - you have to be aware that a lot of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tricky situation because on one hand, it's good that someone was able to catch that potential issue and prevent something bad from happening.  On the other hand, it does raise some questions about who should be monitoring these profiles and under what circumstances.  If they're just randomly looking at everyone's profiles, that's a different story than if they're actively looking for something specific.\n\nPersonally, I've had some concerns about privacy online.  I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook and I'm aware that there are people out there who might be looking at my stuff.  I've even seen a documentary or show about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and meet up with them in a short amount of time.  It's a bit unnerving, but at the same time, I don't want to limit my online presence too much because I value being able to communicate with friends.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, but I guess that's just the way it is when you're online.  I did hear about a school that banned students from having Myspace accounts, which I thought was a bit strange because I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nThat's all I really have to say on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I feel like I have to discuss the Iraq War. To be honest, I'm worried about sounding like one of those people who only speak out against it now, but I genuinely believe it was a bad idea from the start. The general consensus around the world, except within the administration, was that it was a flawed concept. It's pretty clear, given the recent polls. In the US, Iraq, and globally, a staggering 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even a significant number of US troops currently in Iraq, around 70%, believe it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. This disaster was already unfolding before our involvement, and now trying to pull out will only add to it. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, making it extremely challenging, if not impossible, for our administration to impose democracy on a region that may not want it. We have to consider the potential consequences of invading a country, even if its leader was a ruthless dictator like Saddam. I think it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before making such a drastic decision. Withdrawing from Iraq is the most sensible option, considering the situation has only deteriorated since our involvement. I haven't heard any compelling arguments for staying, and I'm not convinced by the administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal. If they want to leave in stages over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I just can't see a valid reason for prolonging our presence. It's ironic that around 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter believe we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help, it's worth considering their opinions, especially since they're the ones who'll be living with the consequences. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least we can't be blamed if things go wrong. If we decide to help after leaving, we might at least be seen as the less-bad guys in the Middle East, which isn't saying much, but it's better than our current situation.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about this, and I believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though - it affects the specific field of work you're in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because of the glass ceiling, even though we're supposed to have equality. It's hard to find people who are willing to work under a woman, especially when society has been conditioned to think otherwise for so long. Women often see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in upper management. This isn't just a women's issue, though - the same thing happens to men in different industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\n\nIt's not common for men to stay at home and take care of the kids, and when they do, people often look down on them because they think men should be the breadwinners. This can be really tough on them, especially if they've always dreamed of being with their kids and helping raise them. In the fashion industry, males are often judged based on their style and background, and if they don't fit the typical mold, people might question their expertise. It's not just about being a man or a woman, though - it's about being taken seriously in your field.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and it's hard to change fast. But I think we're making progress, slowly. Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business, and men are staying at home to care for their kids. People are starting to realize that women might have the better job or that men can be stay-at-home dads. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist, but if you show them the good qualities, they might start to accept it. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become enforced, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though - people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against too. For example, someone from a rural area might not have the best grammar, but they're incredibly intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their accent or lack of grammatical skills. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you're perceived. I think that's another example of how discrimination can work.",
            "I think I've got a better understanding of the situation now - it's been decriminalized, not fully legalized. That means it's more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of being arrested and taken in. However, people still worry about the long-term consequences, like job interviews and things like that, even after it's been decriminalized. On the other hand, arresting people for marijuana possession is expensive - it costs a lot to bring them in, book them, and let them go, not to mention the court costs and public defenders. Some places just can't afford that, so they're not willing to make the change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things like public education and social programs. \n\nIn a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's a good idea. It's freed up a lot of money that can be spent on things that really matter. But, it's not all good - there are still reasons why marijuana shouldn't be widely available, like the fact that it could be a problem if people start smoking and driving. Plus, it's still not widely accepted in a lot of places, so it would be awkward to have it out in the open like that.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles than their motor skills, and that's not something you can generalize easily. People react to substances differently, and some people are naturally more responsible than others. But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects. It's just hard to make a blanket statement about it when people are so different.",
            "I'd say yes to the idea because it has a lot of traditional elements that have been around for a long time. It's great to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. One thing that comes to mind is the Catholic Church's weekly attendance requirement and their strict adherence to tradition. At times, I feel like the Church looks down on people who don't perfectly follow their doctrine, and they often don't accept those who aren't practicing Catholics exactly as they should be. This is evident in my own family's experience - my parents, who were from different religious backgrounds, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. The Catholic teaching of loving others is a great message, but it's not always put into action. I believe the Church sticks to outdated practices, even when they contradict their own teachings. This inconsistency is a significant issue.\n\nAs for the idea of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not convinced it would make a significant difference in the way priests behave. People who are prone to child molestation would likely continue their behavior regardless of their marital status. It's not the same as being married to a consenting adult, and I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a deterrent.\n\nUltimately, I think the real issue is the power dynamic and the lack of accountability, not the fact that priests are celibate. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily change the underlying problems that lead to these horrific acts.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this, but I haven't quite made up my mind yet. To be honest, I'm not sure who's right or wrong on this issue. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're dealing with right now. It's a delicate balance between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a complicated matter that can easily offend someone.\n\nHonestly, I'm having a hard time figuring out whether marriage should be viewed as all civil unions or something more. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining it, considering it's often seen as a sacrament. If it were viewed as a civil union, people would still get tax breaks and the government wouldn't need to consider the specifics of the marriage. In my opinion, that's what it boils down to - two people committing to each other, without the government interfering with church and state.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is involved makes it even more complicated. Essentially, it comes down to two people getting a civil union. If all states could come to a logical agreement, I think they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. The constitution shouldn't be amended for a cause that's not significant enough. It's not a massive issue, and it shouldn't require such a drastic measure to define or ban it.\n\nIt's really not that important to amend the constitution just to deal with gay marriage. Put simply, it's just not worth it.",
            "To be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and for me, homosexuality is a complex issue. I have many gay friends, which has given me a different perspective on the matter. While I may not fully agree with a gay lifestyle, I strongly believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's something the federal government should dictate, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nIt seems like many states have different political leanings, with some being more democratic and others more republican. In a democratic state, it's likely that gay marriage will be supported, and if you choose to live there, you're basically agreeing to abide by their laws. Therefore, I don't think you should disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI do think that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I believe each state should be able to decide whether to legalize gay marriage. This way, it's up to the individual states to make their own decisions, rather than having a single president impose his views on the entire country.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but I'll repeat myself: I don't think President Bush should have the power to dictate whether the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it's up to each individual state to decide how to govern itself. Since the president won't be in office forever, and his successor might have a different stance on the issue, it's best to leave it up to the states. That way, they'll have to live with the consequences of their decision, not the president.\n\nAs for whether a president should be able to impose their will on all states, I don't think so. They can't live in every state, so how could they possibly know what's best for each one? It's better to let the states decide their own fate.\n\nTo answer your question directly, I don't think it's right for the president to have that kind of power. It's just a matter of letting each state govern itself, and the president can focus on more pressing issues.",
            "I'm not sure what you're getting at, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform where you post things for anyone to see, whether it's school officials or not. If you post something online, you have to accept that people will see it, regardless of whether they're from the school or not. In my opinion, if the school officials saw the post, they had every right to because even if it wasn't under the school's name, they could have accessed it from their homes.\n\nAs long as it helps prevent something like a school shooting, which is a school's responsibility, I think it's perfectly fine. If they're going on Myspace to check if students are doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, they're essentially fishing for trouble. But if it leads to making the school a safer place, I don't consider that an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's similar to if they were to go on the internet to prevent students from doing things that put others in danger. If you post something on Myspace, not expecting to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. We all have to be careful about what we post online because it's there forever and can come back to haunt us. Even something you consider harmless can be used against you.\n\nIf a school official catches you doing something bad when you're a student, it's not an invasion of privacy when they take action. It's the same with the internet - once you post something, there's no taking it back. So if you're concerned about a school official seeing your post, maybe you shouldn't post it in the first place.\n\nIf the school officials are using the internet to make the school a safer place, I think that's okay. It's similar to what we did in my high school, where we had lockdown drills and practices to prepare for emergencies. The school officials were just doing the same thing - taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThat's basically my point - it's a public platform, and if you post something online, you have to accept the consequences.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking more about this, and I have to admit that my initial feelings about the war have changed. To be honest, I was really passionate about it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to make a difference and show them what we'd been through. But looking back, I think we jumped into it without a clear plan and without thinking about the long-term consequences. We were so caught up in the emotions and anger that we overlooked some major things.\n\nI genuinely believe that we've been there for too long without making significant progress. The more I see, the more I think that the people over there are their own worst enemies. As long as they're busy fighting with each other, they're not going to be a threat to us. The war has just become a never-ending cycle, and I'm not convinced it's doing much good.\n\nMy feelings have definitely shifted, and I'm now more against the war than I was for it. I don't think we're the right people to try to change them; they've been that way for too long. I'm not saying we should have just left them to their problems, but a more thoughtful approach might have been better. We were so caught up in the desire for revenge that we didn't think things through.\n\nTo be honest, I think President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was also a bit impulsive. I understand where he was coming from at the time, but I think we should have been more careful about how we approached it. We rushed in without a clear plan, and that's led to a lot of confusion and problems.\n\nI still think we did what we had to do, but I wish we'd done it more thoughtfully. We're not going to be able to change them; they're too entrenched in their ways. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going on with this. We're not making enough progress, and when we leave, things will probably just fall apart. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider coming home."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some significant changes. They're losing followers, and it's largely because they're not very accepting of many things. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control is really outdated. While I understand that they have strong views on these topics, I believe that if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to reject the Church's views on these issues, and it's causing a lot of people to turn against them.\n\nIf you're someone who supports abortion or gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a community where these things are viewed as completely wrong. It's the same with other issues – if the Church doesn't agree with your values, you might not want to be part of their community. It's hard to see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think it would have prevented the problems, but it might have made a difference.\n\nI don't get why priests can't have families or lead a normal life outside of their devotion to God. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but so are many other people who have jobs and families. It's not like they're asking for a complete separation from the world; they just want to balance their work and personal life.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, being gay isn't something people choose consciously, so it's not fair to hold them accountable for it. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice they make, and I don't think it's right to punish someone for how they're born. I haven't really thought deeply about this topic, but it seems pretty clear to me that it's wrong to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's not like being gay is something people choose; they're just born that way. I mean, just like I was born straight, and that's not something I consciously chose. It's not fair to hold them responsible for something that's not in their control. I think it's wrong to put people on a pedestal, judging them for being gay.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral values. They're overstepping their boundaries and imposing their opinions on people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nIt's pretty simple: if being gay isn't a choice, then why should the government have the right to intervene? It's not their place to dictate how people live their lives or who they love. I just don't think it's right to punish people for being themselves.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The thing is, there's really no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's a completely different situation, and there are so many nuances to it that make it hard to compare the two. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing - they're not.\n\nWhen it comes to civil rights, gay couples are often left out. For example, when you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be by your side in the hospital or visit you because they're not considered family. That just doesn't seem fair, especially when you're committed to spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. Where people get hung up is when they think that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church. But what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships. People worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are just excuses. What about children of gay couples? Can they really be any different from children of straight couples? In many places, like New York City, kids of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in public schools.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now. President Bush has strong views on gay marriage, but they're based on his personal beliefs, not fact. And let's be honest, morality is subjective and differs from person to person. To impose one group's morality on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they think being gay is a choice or a personality defect, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth, and it's time we listened to the experts, not our neighbors or popular opinion.",
            "So, I wanted to share something with you about my job at the hospital pharmacy over the summer. Just because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it has no therapeutic benefits. In fact, if we're talking about making it available to the public, I firmly believe the answer is no - absolutely not. However, if we're discussing its potential use for medicinal purposes, then yes, I think it's definitely worth considering. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of illicit substances that we use in pharmacies all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. These are controlled substances, but we use them because they have benefits and if we dismiss those benefits just because there's a stigma around marijuana, then I don't think that makes sense. \n\nI also don't think marijuana is comparable to alcohol, at least in terms of its potential for abuse. If you misuse alcohol, it can lead to serious issues, but the same thing can happen with marijuana. However, I do think it's worth integrating it into society gradually, rather than suddenly legalizing it. This way, people might learn to use it responsibly. \n\nOne of the main reasons people have a negative perception of marijuana is that it's illegal. But let's be real, it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could break down that image and show that marijuana is not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be, then people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday, get all dressed up, and see my friends from private school. However, now they've introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress way more casually. You'd see people coming in their beach clothes straight from the beach, even during the morning masses where everyone used to dress up. It's become a lot more relaxed. \n\nOne thing that really stands out to me is the change in dress code. People used to dress up, now they wear jeans or khakis. It's not a bad thing, it's just more casual. As for the church's inner workings, I'm not really aware of that, but I guess that's what it is now.\n\nRegarding the recent scandals about the Catholic church and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who are married and still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not about being allowed to get married or not. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and I think that's a big part of the problem. \n\nI mean, there are other religions that allow priests to be married, like Seventh Heaven, and their priests are still reverends or ministers. If someone really wants to practice their faith and get married, then they might want to look into a different faith. I think the root of the problem is more genetic, and people are born with these tendencies. You can't change that through marriage, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, then that's a whole different story, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.\n\nI don't have much else to say about the Catholic church, but I do think it's worth noting that if they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's shameful.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. It seemed like we went to war in Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which was later proven to be false. This really got under my skin. I think the Bush administration was openly deceiving the American people, and despite the evidence, they've never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced of the evidence at the time. That raises serious questions about the administration's integrity and their disregard for the constitution. It seems they've been trying to erode it since 9/11. \n\nI believe they came into office with the intention of going to war. A former treasury secretary mentioned this in his book, suggesting that President Bush was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein, which was also motivated by his father's administration. This was an underhanded way to achieve their goals.\n\nI think it's time we moved on from this conflict, but withdrawing now would likely lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order, also raises concerns. I'm not convinced this will work in the long run because it'll raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of their government. The news reports indicate that the interim government is struggling, the parliament is ineffective, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a complex and fractious situation, and I'm not sure how to articulate my concerns in a polite way.",
            "I've been thinking more about the war in Iraq, and I have to admit, it's been a bit of a struggle for me to keep up with everything. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, right? It feels like we went into it as a way to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks, but that's just my opinion. To be honest, I'm not really well-versed on the details, but I know we're trying to establish a democracy there, which seems like a great goal, but it's a long process. And now, it's like we're staying for oil and resources too. That's just not a good enough reason to keep it going when it's causing so much distress. It's a tough spot, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.\n\nOn one hand, I feel like we should keep trying to help them build a democracy, but on the other hand, it's like we're trying to impose our own values and systems on them, which could make things worse. And with the way things are going, it's hard to see a clear end in sight. I'm worried that if we stay, we'll just be prolonging the suffering and creating more hatred towards the US. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I know it's not going to be easy.\n\nI do think that we shouldn't call it a war anymore, though. I mean, we didn't declare it as a war through Congress, so it's not really a declared war, is it? And that's how it should be done, right? It's all just a big mess, and I'm not sure what the best way forward is.\n\nIt's hard for me because I know people I care about have family members over there, and it's tough to see them having to deal with all this. But at the same time, I feel like we're kind of destroying their lives and their culture. I'm not sure what the right thing to do is, but I know it's not going to be simple.",
            "Honestly, I have my doubts about it being right for a state to make it legal. I believe it's more the church's decision, considering the constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's explicitly mentioned, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established. \n\nI think it's not just about one particular set of people trying to make it illegal, but more about picking and choosing which church's beliefs to support over others. As we can see, many Catholics and Christians are against it, but it's not a unified stance across the board. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't enforce.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend it would be contradictory to what's already been written and could essentially restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should stay out of this issue. I'm not sure why there's a push for an amendment, except that it aligns with the president's personal Catholic beliefs. This shows that he's favoring one religion over others, which I don't think is right. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There's no concrete reason for the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have a significant impact on the economy. \n\nIf anything, it might have a positive effect on society. I think I've covered all my points.",
            "Let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government was not entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. They tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not that straightforward. The government capitalized on the public's outrage after 9/11 to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I've always been against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. In many ways, the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should've learned from its past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is heartbreaking.\n\nThe US government made a serious mistake by removing Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath. They tried to implant a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they didn't consider the long-term consequences. It's not an easy process to establish a stable democracy, and it's unrealistic to expect it to happen quickly. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and challenging process.\n\nOne of the main issues is that the US got involved in a war without being prepared for the outcome. They're still in Iraq in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. The situation is a long way from being resolved, and it's clear that the US government wasn't prepared for the void of power and chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nIt's hard to justify the continued involvement in Iraq when the government's initial reasons for going to war, such as the presence of WMDs, were proven false. North Korea, which actually had WMDs, didn't face the same level of aggression. It's clear that the US government is prioritizing its own interests, particularly access to oil resources, over the well-being of the people in Iraq.\n\nIt's difficult to make a decision on what to do next, but I hope that the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. However, given the current situation, it's hard to be optimistic.",
            "Well, let me think for a moment. I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage, and I've always been that way. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and something that's increasingly being shown to be influenced by biology rather than social factors. It's unfair to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control. I'm a firm supporter of gay marriage, and I think it's inhumane to discriminate against individuals in this way.\n\nIn my opinion, governments and politics shouldn't interfere with this issue at all. It's a personal and private matter, not something that should be decided at the state or national level. I've seen it firsthand in my own community - there are openly gay couples living just like any other family, taking care of their daily responsibilities and living their lives without any issues. It's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to impose his own interpretation of marriage on the rest of us.\n\nI've done some research, and it seems that there's a growing understanding that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. So, it's not necessarily something that's chosen, but rather something people are born with.\n\nTo me, the fact that straight couples can get married in secret without any fuss, but gay couples are put under a microscope, is a huge issue. It's something that should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle. I think it's time we treat all couples equally and respect their right to love and marry whoever they choose.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's essentially a public declaration. It's out there for anyone to see, and you can't take it back. As someone who's dealt with this in my role as an R.A., it's a reality you have to face. What you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or extreme actions, someone's bound to take notice and share it. The internet is a global platform, and if you're connected to someone who receives that bulletin, they might react. Schools, for instance, can't ignore these warnings; they have to act on them to ensure everyone's safety. However, it's also challenging to discern what's serious and what's just a joke, especially when we've seen cases like the one that happened at our school, which could have been a twisted social experiment gone wrong. In this particular instance, someone overheard a comment and reported it to the school after researching the individual's online presence. They found concerning content that, in hindsight, was meant as a joke but took on a serious tone in the context. When you put something online, you lose control over who sees it and what they make of it. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't dictate how people perceive you or what they take seriously. Schools shouldn't be monitoring students' online activities, but if concerns are raised, they do have a responsibility to investigate. It's a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety. I think school officials should focus on addressing issues raised by students, rather than actively searching for information. But if concerns are brought to their attention, they should take them seriously and act accordingly.",
            "I'm getting the feeling that the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble cause. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. It now feels like we're fighting just for the sake of it, to prove our military might, rather than for the original reason. I'm also concerned that the underlying motivations might have been questionable from the start, considering the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country with no fair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if there were no personal interests involved. Unfortunately, I think our purpose has been distorted over time. I believe we made our point with the initial invasion, which was a significant statement in itself. However, the fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, maybe even years, is just too long.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a legitimate reason for war, but I don't think that's our reason anymore. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, to avoid losing face or to claim a decisive victory. I genuinely think it's time to bring this to an end.\n\nI believe it's been long enough for the local government to take responsibility for themselves. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be better spent on our own pressing issues like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. It's like we're sacrificing our own citizens for a cause that's been lost. Our economy is being drained, and I think it's time to stop this unnecessary expenditure.\n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal improvements. The money being spent on this war could be better spent on our own citizens' welfare. It's a shame that our own people are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer valid.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I had a thought and I wanted to clarify it.  It was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue.  I think it's fair to say that when you post information online, like on Myspace, you have to know that lots of people can see it.  Even though you have to accept someone as a friend before they can view your profile, you're essentially giving them permission to see it.  It's like this whenever you put anything online - you have to be aware that a lot of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tricky situation because on one hand, it's good that someone was able to catch that potential issue and prevent something bad from happening.  On the other hand, it does raise some questions about who should be monitoring these profiles and under what circumstances.  If they're just randomly looking at everyone's profiles, that's a different story than if they're actively looking for something specific.\n\nPersonally, I've had some concerns about privacy online.  I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook and I'm aware that there are people out there who might be looking at my stuff.  I've even seen a documentary or show about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and meet up with them in a short amount of time.  It's a bit unnerving, but at the same time, I don't want to limit my online presence too much because I value being able to communicate with friends.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, but I guess that's just the way it is when you're online.  I did hear about a school that banned students from having Myspace accounts, which I thought was a bit strange because I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nThat's all I really have to say on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I feel like I have to discuss the Iraq War. To be honest, I'm worried about sounding like one of those people who only speak out against it now, but I genuinely believe it was a bad idea from the start. The general consensus around the world, except within the administration, was that it was a flawed concept. It's pretty clear, given the recent polls. In the US, Iraq, and globally, a staggering 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even a significant number of US troops currently in Iraq, around 70%, believe it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. This disaster was already unfolding before our involvement, and now trying to pull out will only add to it. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, making it extremely challenging, if not impossible, for our administration to impose democracy on a region that may not want it. We have to consider the potential consequences of invading a country, even if its leader was a ruthless dictator like Saddam. I think it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before making such a drastic decision. Withdrawing from Iraq is the most sensible option, considering the situation has only deteriorated since our involvement. I haven't heard any compelling arguments for staying, and I'm not convinced by the administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal. If they want to leave in stages over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I just can't see a valid reason for prolonging our presence. It's ironic that around 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter believe we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help, it's worth considering their opinions, especially since they're the ones who'll be living with the consequences. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least we can't be blamed if things go wrong. If we decide to help after leaving, we might at least be seen as the less-bad guys in the Middle East, which isn't saying much, but it's better than our current situation.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about this, and I believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though - it affects the specific field of work you're in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because of the glass ceiling, even though we're supposed to have equality. It's hard to find people who are willing to work under a woman, especially when society has been conditioned to think otherwise for so long. Women often see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in upper management. This isn't just a women's issue, though - the same thing happens to men in different industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\n\nIt's not common for men to stay at home and take care of the kids, and when they do, people often look down on them because they think men should be the breadwinners. This can be really tough on them, especially if they've always dreamed of being with their kids and helping raise them. In the fashion industry, males are often judged based on their style and background, and if they don't fit the typical mold, people might question their expertise. It's not just about being a man or a woman, though - it's about being taken seriously in your field.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and it's hard to change fast. But I think we're making progress, slowly. Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business, and men are staying at home to care for their kids. People are starting to realize that women might have the better job or that men can be stay-at-home dads. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist, but if you show them the good qualities, they might start to accept it. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become enforced, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though - people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against too. For example, someone from a rural area might not have the best grammar, but they're incredibly intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their accent or lack of grammatical skills. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you're perceived. I think that's another example of how discrimination can work.",
            "I think I've got a better understanding of the situation now - it's been decriminalized, not fully legalized. That means it's more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of being arrested and taken in. However, people still worry about the long-term consequences, like job interviews and things like that, even after it's been decriminalized. On the other hand, arresting people for marijuana possession is expensive - it costs a lot to bring them in, book them, and let them go, not to mention the court costs and public defenders. Some places just can't afford that, so they're not willing to make the change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things like public education and social programs. \n\nIn a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's a good idea. It's freed up a lot of money that can be spent on things that really matter. But, it's not all good - there are still reasons why marijuana shouldn't be widely available, like the fact that it could be a problem if people start smoking and driving. Plus, it's still not widely accepted in a lot of places, so it would be awkward to have it out in the open like that.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles than their motor skills, and that's not something you can generalize easily. People react to substances differently, and some people are naturally more responsible than others. But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects. It's just hard to make a blanket statement about it when people are so different.",
            "I'd say yes to the idea because it has a lot of traditional elements that have been around for a long time. It's great to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. One thing that comes to mind is the Catholic Church's weekly attendance requirement and their strict adherence to tradition. At times, I feel like the Church looks down on people who don't perfectly follow their doctrine, and they often don't accept those who aren't practicing Catholics exactly as they should be. This is evident in my own family's experience - my parents, who were from different religious backgrounds, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. The Catholic teaching of loving others is a great message, but it's not always put into action. I believe the Church sticks to outdated practices, even when they contradict their own teachings. This inconsistency is a significant issue.\n\nAs for the idea of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not convinced it would make a significant difference in the way priests behave. People who are prone to child molestation would likely continue their behavior regardless of their marital status. It's not the same as being married to a consenting adult, and I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a deterrent.\n\nUltimately, I think the real issue is the power dynamic and the lack of accountability, not the fact that priests are celibate. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily change the underlying problems that lead to these horrific acts.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this, but I haven't quite made up my mind yet. To be honest, I'm not sure who's right or wrong on this issue. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're dealing with right now. It's a delicate balance between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a complicated matter that can easily offend someone.\n\nHonestly, I'm having a hard time figuring out whether marriage should be viewed as all civil unions or something more. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining it, considering it's often seen as a sacrament. If it were viewed as a civil union, people would still get tax breaks and the government wouldn't need to consider the specifics of the marriage. In my opinion, that's what it boils down to - two people committing to each other, without the government interfering with church and state.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is involved makes it even more complicated. Essentially, it comes down to two people getting a civil union. If all states could come to a logical agreement, I think they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. The constitution shouldn't be amended for a cause that's not significant enough. It's not a massive issue, and it shouldn't require such a drastic measure to define or ban it.\n\nIt's really not that important to amend the constitution just to deal with gay marriage. Put simply, it's just not worth it.",
            "To be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and for me, homosexuality is a complex issue. I have many gay friends, which has given me a different perspective on the matter. While I may not fully agree with a gay lifestyle, I strongly believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's something the federal government should dictate, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nIt seems like many states have different political leanings, with some being more democratic and others more republican. In a democratic state, it's likely that gay marriage will be supported, and if you choose to live there, you're basically agreeing to abide by their laws. Therefore, I don't think you should disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI do think that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I believe each state should be able to decide whether to legalize gay marriage. This way, it's up to the individual states to make their own decisions, rather than having a single president impose his views on the entire country.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but I'll repeat myself: I don't think President Bush should have the power to dictate whether the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it's up to each individual state to decide how to govern itself. Since the president won't be in office forever, and his successor might have a different stance on the issue, it's best to leave it up to the states. That way, they'll have to live with the consequences of their decision, not the president.\n\nAs for whether a president should be able to impose their will on all states, I don't think so. They can't live in every state, so how could they possibly know what's best for each one? It's better to let the states decide their own fate.\n\nTo answer your question directly, I don't think it's right for the president to have that kind of power. It's just a matter of letting each state govern itself, and the president can focus on more pressing issues.",
            "I'm not sure what you're getting at, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform where you post things for anyone to see, whether it's school officials or not. If you post something online, you have to accept that people will see it, regardless of whether they're from the school or not. In my opinion, if the school officials saw the post, they had every right to because even if it wasn't under the school's name, they could have accessed it from their homes.\n\nAs long as it helps prevent something like a school shooting, which is a school's responsibility, I think it's perfectly fine. If they're going on Myspace to check if students are doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, they're essentially fishing for trouble. But if it leads to making the school a safer place, I don't consider that an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's similar to if they were to go on the internet to prevent students from doing things that put others in danger. If you post something on Myspace, not expecting to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. We all have to be careful about what we post online because it's there forever and can come back to haunt us. Even something you consider harmless can be used against you.\n\nIf a school official catches you doing something bad when you're a student, it's not an invasion of privacy when they take action. It's the same with the internet - once you post something, there's no taking it back. So if you're concerned about a school official seeing your post, maybe you shouldn't post it in the first place.\n\nIf the school officials are using the internet to make the school a safer place, I think that's okay. It's similar to what we did in my high school, where we had lockdown drills and practices to prepare for emergencies. The school officials were just doing the same thing - taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThat's basically my point - it's a public platform, and if you post something online, you have to accept the consequences.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking more about this, and I have to admit that my initial feelings about the war have changed. To be honest, I was really passionate about it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to make a difference and show them what we'd been through. But looking back, I think we jumped into it without a clear plan and without thinking about the long-term consequences. We were so caught up in the emotions and anger that we overlooked some major things.\n\nI genuinely believe that we've been there for too long without making significant progress. The more I see, the more I think that the people over there are their own worst enemies. As long as they're busy fighting with each other, they're not going to be a threat to us. The war has just become a never-ending cycle, and I'm not convinced it's doing much good.\n\nMy feelings have definitely shifted, and I'm now more against the war than I was for it. I don't think we're the right people to try to change them; they've been that way for too long. I'm not saying we should have just left them to their problems, but a more thoughtful approach might have been better. We were so caught up in the desire for revenge that we didn't think things through.\n\nTo be honest, I think President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was also a bit impulsive. I understand where he was coming from at the time, but I think we should have been more careful about how we approached it. We rushed in without a clear plan, and that's led to a lot of confusion and problems.\n\nI still think we did what we had to do, but I wish we'd done it more thoughtfully. We're not going to be able to change them; they're too entrenched in their ways. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going on with this. We're not making enough progress, and when we leave, things will probably just fall apart. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider coming home."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some significant changes. They're losing followers, and it's largely because they're not very accepting of many things. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control is really outdated. While I understand that they have strong views on these topics, I believe that if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their following. Many people are starting to reject the Church's views on these issues, and it's causing a lot of people to turn against them.\n\nIf you're someone who supports abortion or gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a community where these things are viewed as completely wrong. It's the same with other issues – if the Church doesn't agree with your values, you might not want to be part of their community. It's hard to see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think it would have prevented the problems, but it might have made a difference.\n\nI don't get why priests can't have families or lead a normal life outside of their devotion to God. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God, but so are many other people who have jobs and families. It's not like they're asking for a complete separation from the world; they just want to balance their work and personal life.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, being gay isn't something people choose consciously, so it's not fair to hold them accountable for it. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice they make, and I don't think it's right to punish someone for how they're born. I haven't really thought deeply about this topic, but it seems pretty clear to me that it's wrong to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's not like being gay is something people choose; they're just born that way. I mean, just like I was born straight, and that's not something I consciously chose. It's not fair to hold them responsible for something that's not in their control. I think it's wrong to put people on a pedestal, judging them for being gay.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral values. They're overstepping their boundaries and imposing their opinions on people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nIt's pretty simple: if being gay isn't a choice, then why should the government have the right to intervene? It's not their place to dictate how people live their lives or who they love. I just don't think it's right to punish people for being themselves.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I truly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The thing is, there's really no valid reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's just not true. It's a completely different situation, and there are so many nuances to it that make it hard to compare the two. It's like saying heads and tails are the same thing - they're not.\n\nWhen it comes to civil rights, gay couples are often left out. For example, when you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be by your side in the hospital or visit you because they're not considered family. That just doesn't seem fair, especially when you're committed to spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. Where people get hung up is when they think that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church. But what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If you allow someone a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships. People worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are just excuses. What about children of gay couples? Can they really be any different from children of straight couples? In many places, like New York City, kids of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in public schools.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand and make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now. President Bush has strong views on gay marriage, but they're based on his personal beliefs, not fact. And let's be honest, morality is subjective and differs from person to person. To impose one group's morality on everyone else is unfair and hypocritical, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they think being gay is a choice or a personality defect, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked that myth, and it's time we listened to the experts, not our neighbors or popular opinion.",
            "So, I wanted to share something with you about my job at the hospital pharmacy over the summer. Just because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it has no therapeutic benefits. In fact, if we're talking about making it available to the public, I firmly believe the answer is no - absolutely not. However, if we're discussing its potential use for medicinal purposes, then yes, I think it's definitely worth considering. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of illicit substances that we use in pharmacies all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. These are controlled substances, but we use them because they have benefits and if we dismiss those benefits just because there's a stigma around marijuana, then I don't think that makes sense. \n\nI also don't think marijuana is comparable to alcohol, at least in terms of its potential for abuse. If you misuse alcohol, it can lead to serious issues, but the same thing can happen with marijuana. However, I do think it's worth integrating it into society gradually, rather than suddenly legalizing it. This way, people might learn to use it responsibly. \n\nOne of the main reasons people have a negative perception of marijuana is that it's illegal. But let's be real, it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could break down that image and show that marijuana is not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be, then people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has really adapted to the 21st century, it's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday, get all dressed up, and see my friends from private school. However, now they've introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress way more casually. You'd see people coming in their beach clothes straight from the beach, even during the morning masses where everyone used to dress up. It's become a lot more relaxed. \n\nOne thing that really stands out to me is the change in dress code. People used to dress up, now they wear jeans or khakis. It's not a bad thing, it's just more casual. As for the church's inner workings, I'm not really aware of that, but I guess that's what it is now.\n\nRegarding the recent scandals about the Catholic church and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who are married and still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not about being allowed to get married or not. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and I think that's a big part of the problem. \n\nI mean, there are other religions that allow priests to be married, like Seventh Heaven, and their priests are still reverends or ministers. If someone really wants to practice their faith and get married, then they might want to look into a different faith. I think the root of the problem is more genetic, and people are born with these tendencies. You can't change that through marriage, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about it and tried to cover it up, then that's a whole different story, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.\n\nI don't have much else to say about the Catholic church, but I do think it's worth noting that if they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's shameful.",
            "I was initially okay with the idea, but I think the country was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. It seemed like we went to war in Iraq as a result of a series of pretexts. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which was later proven to be false. This really got under my skin. I think the Bush administration was openly deceiving the American people, and despite the evidence, they've never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced of the evidence at the time. That raises serious questions about the administration's integrity and their disregard for the constitution. It seems they've been trying to erode it since 9/11. \n\nI believe they came into office with the intention of going to war. A former treasury secretary mentioned this in his book, suggesting that President Bush was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein, which was also motivated by his father's administration. This was an underhanded way to achieve their goals.\n\nI think it's time we moved on from this conflict, but withdrawing now would likely lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative plan, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order, also raises concerns. I'm not convinced this will work in the long run because it'll raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of their government. The news reports indicate that the interim government is struggling, the parliament is ineffective, and radical elements are vying for control. It's a complex and fractious situation, and I'm not sure how to articulate my concerns in a polite way.",
            "I've been thinking more about the war in Iraq, and I have to admit, it's been a bit of a struggle for me to keep up with everything. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, right? It feels like we went into it as a way to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks, but that's just my opinion. To be honest, I'm not really well-versed on the details, but I know we're trying to establish a democracy there, which seems like a great goal, but it's a long process. And now, it's like we're staying for oil and resources too. That's just not a good enough reason to keep it going when it's causing so much distress. It's a tough spot, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.\n\nOn one hand, I feel like we should keep trying to help them build a democracy, but on the other hand, it's like we're trying to impose our own values and systems on them, which could make things worse. And with the way things are going, it's hard to see a clear end in sight. I'm worried that if we stay, we'll just be prolonging the suffering and creating more hatred towards the US. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I know it's not going to be easy.\n\nI do think that we shouldn't call it a war anymore, though. I mean, we didn't declare it as a war through Congress, so it's not really a declared war, is it? And that's how it should be done, right? It's all just a big mess, and I'm not sure what the best way forward is.\n\nIt's hard for me because I know people I care about have family members over there, and it's tough to see them having to deal with all this. But at the same time, I feel like we're kind of destroying their lives and their culture. I'm not sure what the right thing to do is, but I know it's not going to be simple.",
            "Honestly, I have my doubts about it being right for a state to make it legal. I believe it's more the church's decision, considering the constitution clearly states separation of church and state. It's explicitly mentioned, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established. \n\nI think it's not just about one particular set of people trying to make it illegal, but more about picking and choosing which church's beliefs to support over others. As we can see, many Catholics and Christians are against it, but it's not a unified stance across the board. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't enforce.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend it would be contradictory to what's already been written and could essentially restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should stay out of this issue. I'm not sure why there's a push for an amendment, except that it aligns with the president's personal Catholic beliefs. This shows that he's favoring one religion over others, which I don't think is right. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There's no concrete reason for the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have a significant impact on the economy. \n\nIf anything, it might have a positive effect on society. I think I've covered all my points.",
            "Let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government was not entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. They tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it's not that straightforward. The government capitalized on the public's outrage after 9/11 to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I've always been against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes. In many ways, the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should've learned from its past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is heartbreaking.\n\nThe US government made a serious mistake by removing Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath. They tried to implant a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they didn't consider the long-term consequences. It's not an easy process to establish a stable democracy, and it's unrealistic to expect it to happen quickly. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and challenging process.\n\nOne of the main issues is that the US got involved in a war without being prepared for the outcome. They're still in Iraq in 2006, and many American troops are still dying. The situation is a long way from being resolved, and it's clear that the US government wasn't prepared for the void of power and chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nIt's hard to justify the continued involvement in Iraq when the government's initial reasons for going to war, such as the presence of WMDs, were proven false. North Korea, which actually had WMDs, didn't face the same level of aggression. It's clear that the US government is prioritizing its own interests, particularly access to oil resources, over the well-being of the people in Iraq.\n\nIt's difficult to make a decision on what to do next, but I hope that the conflict ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. However, given the current situation, it's hard to be optimistic.",
            "Well, let me think for a moment. I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage, and I've always been that way. I genuinely believe it's a matter of personal preference, and something that's increasingly being shown to be influenced by biology rather than social factors. It's unfair to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control. I'm a firm supporter of gay marriage, and I think it's inhumane to discriminate against individuals in this way.\n\nIn my opinion, governments and politics shouldn't interfere with this issue at all. It's a personal and private matter, not something that should be decided at the state or national level. I've seen it firsthand in my own community - there are openly gay couples living just like any other family, taking care of their daily responsibilities and living their lives without any issues. It's ridiculous that President Bush is trying to impose his own interpretation of marriage on the rest of us.\n\nI've done some research, and it seems that there's a growing understanding that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing or environment. So, it's not necessarily something that's chosen, but rather something people are born with.\n\nTo me, the fact that straight couples can get married in secret without any fuss, but gay couples are put under a microscope, is a huge issue. It's something that should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle. I think it's time we treat all couples equally and respect their right to love and marry whoever they choose.",
            "Honestly, when you post something online, it's essentially a public declaration. It's out there for anyone to see, and you can't take it back. As someone who's dealt with this in my role as an R.A., it's a reality you have to face. What you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or extreme actions, someone's bound to take notice and share it. The internet is a global platform, and if you're connected to someone who receives that bulletin, they might react. Schools, for instance, can't ignore these warnings; they have to act on them to ensure everyone's safety. However, it's also challenging to discern what's serious and what's just a joke, especially when we've seen cases like the one that happened at our school, which could have been a twisted social experiment gone wrong. In this particular instance, someone overheard a comment and reported it to the school after researching the individual's online presence. They found concerning content that, in hindsight, was meant as a joke but took on a serious tone in the context. When you put something online, you lose control over who sees it and what they make of it. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't dictate how people perceive you or what they take seriously. Schools shouldn't be monitoring students' online activities, but if concerns are raised, they do have a responsibility to investigate. It's a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety. I think school officials should focus on addressing issues raised by students, rather than actively searching for information. But if concerns are brought to their attention, they should take them seriously and act accordingly.",
            "I'm getting the feeling that the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the goal was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble cause. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. It now feels like we're fighting just for the sake of it, to prove our military might, rather than for the original reason. I'm also concerned that the underlying motivations might have been questionable from the start, considering the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country with no fair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, but only if there were no personal interests involved. Unfortunately, I think our purpose has been distorted over time. I believe we made our point with the initial invasion, which was a significant statement in itself. However, the fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, maybe even years, is just too long.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a legitimate reason for war, but I don't think that's our reason anymore. It seems like we're still fighting for the sake of fighting, to avoid losing face or to claim a decisive victory. I genuinely think it's time to bring this to an end.\n\nI believe it's been long enough for the local government to take responsibility for themselves. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be better spent on our own pressing issues like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. It's like we're sacrificing our own citizens for a cause that's been lost. Our economy is being drained, and I think it's time to stop this unnecessary expenditure.\n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal improvements. The money being spent on this war could be better spent on our own citizens' welfare. It's a shame that our own people are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer valid.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I had a thought and I wanted to clarify it.  It was stopped because someone went online and found that there was a potential issue.  I think it's fair to say that when you post information online, like on Myspace, you have to know that lots of people can see it.  Even though you have to accept someone as a friend before they can view your profile, you're essentially giving them permission to see it.  It's like this whenever you put anything online - you have to be aware that a lot of people are going to see it.\n\nIt's a tricky situation because on one hand, it's good that someone was able to catch that potential issue and prevent something bad from happening.  On the other hand, it does raise some questions about who should be monitoring these profiles and under what circumstances.  If they're just randomly looking at everyone's profiles, that's a different story than if they're actively looking for something specific.\n\nPersonally, I've had some concerns about privacy online.  I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook and I'm aware that there are people out there who might be looking at my stuff.  I've even seen a documentary or show about someone who was able to gather information about someone online and meet up with them in a short amount of time.  It's a bit unnerving, but at the same time, I don't want to limit my online presence too much because I value being able to communicate with friends.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, but I guess that's just the way it is when you're online.  I did hear about a school that banned students from having Myspace accounts, which I thought was a bit strange because I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nThat's all I really have to say on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, but I feel like I have to discuss the Iraq War. To be honest, I'm worried about sounding like one of those people who only speak out against it now, but I genuinely believe it was a bad idea from the start. The general consensus around the world, except within the administration, was that it was a flawed concept. It's pretty clear, given the recent polls. In the US, Iraq, and globally, a staggering 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even a significant number of US troops currently in Iraq, around 70%, believe it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. This disaster was already unfolding before our involvement, and now trying to pull out will only add to it. The cultural differences between the US and the Middle East are vast, making it extremely challenging, if not impossible, for our administration to impose democracy on a region that may not want it. We have to consider the potential consequences of invading a country, even if its leader was a ruthless dictator like Saddam. I think it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before making such a drastic decision. Withdrawing from Iraq is the most sensible option, considering the situation has only deteriorated since our involvement. I haven't heard any compelling arguments for staying, and I'm not convinced by the administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal. If they want to leave in stages over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I just can't see a valid reason for prolonging our presence. It's ironic that around 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter believe we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help, it's worth considering their opinions, especially since they're the ones who'll be living with the consequences. If we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then at least we can't be blamed if things go wrong. If we decide to help after leaving, we might at least be seen as the less-bad guys in the Middle East, which isn't saying much, but it's better than our current situation.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about this, and I believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though - it affects the specific field of work you're in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because of the glass ceiling, even though we're supposed to have equality. It's hard to find people who are willing to work under a woman, especially when society has been conditioned to think otherwise for so long. Women often see a job they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in upper management. This isn't just a women's issue, though - the same thing happens to men in different industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\n\nIt's not common for men to stay at home and take care of the kids, and when they do, people often look down on them because they think men should be the breadwinners. This can be really tough on them, especially if they've always dreamed of being with their kids and helping raise them. In the fashion industry, males are often judged based on their style and background, and if they don't fit the typical mold, people might question their expertise. It's not just about being a man or a woman, though - it's about being taken seriously in your field.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because society has a set way of thinking, and it's hard to change fast. But I think we're making progress, slowly. Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business, and men are staying at home to care for their kids. People are starting to realize that women might have the better job or that men can be stay-at-home dads. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist, but if you show them the good qualities, they might start to accept it. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become enforced, and I'm not sure what more we can do that hasn't already been done.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though - people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against too. For example, someone from a rural area might not have the best grammar, but they're incredibly intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their accent or lack of grammatical skills. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you're perceived. I think that's another example of how discrimination can work.",
            "I think I've got a better understanding of the situation now - it's been decriminalized, not fully legalized. That means it's more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of being arrested and taken in. However, people still worry about the long-term consequences, like job interviews and things like that, even after it's been decriminalized. On the other hand, arresting people for marijuana possession is expensive - it costs a lot to bring them in, book them, and let them go, not to mention the court costs and public defenders. Some places just can't afford that, so they're not willing to make the change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things like public education and social programs. \n\nIn a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's a good idea. It's freed up a lot of money that can be spent on things that really matter. But, it's not all good - there are still reasons why marijuana shouldn't be widely available, like the fact that it could be a problem if people start smoking and driving. Plus, it's still not widely accepted in a lot of places, so it would be awkward to have it out in the open like that.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles than their motor skills, and that's not something you can generalize easily. People react to substances differently, and some people are naturally more responsible than others. But I do think that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects. It's just hard to make a blanket statement about it when people are so different.",
            "I'd say yes to the idea because it has a lot of traditional elements that have been around for a long time. It's great to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. One thing that comes to mind is the Catholic Church's weekly attendance requirement and their strict adherence to tradition. At times, I feel like the Church looks down on people who don't perfectly follow their doctrine, and they often don't accept those who aren't practicing Catholics exactly as they should be. This is evident in my own family's experience - my parents, who were from different religious backgrounds, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. The Catholic teaching of loving others is a great message, but it's not always put into action. I believe the Church sticks to outdated practices, even when they contradict their own teachings. This inconsistency is a significant issue.\n\nAs for the idea of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not convinced it would make a significant difference in the way priests behave. People who are prone to child molestation would likely continue their behavior regardless of their marital status. It's not the same as being married to a consenting adult, and I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a deterrent.\n\nUltimately, I think the real issue is the power dynamic and the lack of accountability, not the fact that priests are celibate. Allowing priests to be married wouldn't necessarily change the underlying problems that lead to these horrific acts.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this, but I haven't quite made up my mind yet. To be honest, I'm not sure who's right or wrong on this issue. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're dealing with right now. It's a delicate balance between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a complicated matter that can easily offend someone.\n\nHonestly, I'm having a hard time figuring out whether marriage should be viewed as all civil unions or something more. I'm not sure if the government should be involved in defining it, considering it's often seen as a sacrament. If it were viewed as a civil union, people would still get tax breaks and the government wouldn't need to consider the specifics of the marriage. In my opinion, that's what it boils down to - two people committing to each other, without the government interfering with church and state.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is involved makes it even more complicated. Essentially, it comes down to two people getting a civil union. If all states could come to a logical agreement, I think they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. The constitution shouldn't be amended for a cause that's not significant enough. It's not a massive issue, and it shouldn't require such a drastic measure to define or ban it.\n\nIt's really not that important to amend the constitution just to deal with gay marriage. Put simply, it's just not worth it.",
            "To be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and for me, homosexuality is a complex issue. I have many gay friends, which has given me a different perspective on the matter. While I may not fully agree with a gay lifestyle, I strongly believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's something the federal government should dictate, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nIt seems like many states have different political leanings, with some being more democratic and others more republican. In a democratic state, it's likely that gay marriage will be supported, and if you choose to live there, you're basically agreeing to abide by their laws. Therefore, I don't think you should disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI do think that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I believe each state should be able to decide whether to legalize gay marriage. This way, it's up to the individual states to make their own decisions, rather than having a single president impose his views on the entire country.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but I'll repeat myself: I don't think President Bush should have the power to dictate whether the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it's up to each individual state to decide how to govern itself. Since the president won't be in office forever, and his successor might have a different stance on the issue, it's best to leave it up to the states. That way, they'll have to live with the consequences of their decision, not the president.\n\nAs for whether a president should be able to impose their will on all states, I don't think so. They can't live in every state, so how could they possibly know what's best for each one? It's better to let the states decide their own fate.\n\nTo answer your question directly, I don't think it's right for the president to have that kind of power. It's just a matter of letting each state govern itself, and the president can focus on more pressing issues.",
            "I'm not sure what you're getting at, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform where you post things for anyone to see, whether it's school officials or not. If you post something online, you have to accept that people will see it, regardless of whether they're from the school or not. In my opinion, if the school officials saw the post, they had every right to because even if it wasn't under the school's name, they could have accessed it from their homes.\n\nAs long as it helps prevent something like a school shooting, which is a school's responsibility, I think it's perfectly fine. If they're going on Myspace to check if students are doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, they're essentially fishing for trouble. But if it leads to making the school a safer place, I don't consider that an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's similar to if they were to go on the internet to prevent students from doing things that put others in danger. If you post something on Myspace, not expecting to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. We all have to be careful about what we post online because it's there forever and can come back to haunt us. Even something you consider harmless can be used against you.\n\nIf a school official catches you doing something bad when you're a student, it's not an invasion of privacy when they take action. It's the same with the internet - once you post something, there's no taking it back. So if you're concerned about a school official seeing your post, maybe you shouldn't post it in the first place.\n\nIf the school officials are using the internet to make the school a safer place, I think that's okay. It's similar to what we did in my high school, where we had lockdown drills and practices to prepare for emergencies. The school officials were just doing the same thing - taking steps to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThat's basically my point - it's a public platform, and if you post something online, you have to accept the consequences.",
            "Okay, I've been thinking more about this, and I have to admit that my initial feelings about the war have changed. To be honest, I was really passionate about it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to make a difference and show them what we'd been through. But looking back, I think we jumped into it without a clear plan and without thinking about the long-term consequences. We were so caught up in the emotions and anger that we overlooked some major things.\n\nI genuinely believe that we've been there for too long without making significant progress. The more I see, the more I think that the people over there are their own worst enemies. As long as they're busy fighting with each other, they're not going to be a threat to us. The war has just become a never-ending cycle, and I'm not convinced it's doing much good.\n\nMy feelings have definitely shifted, and I'm now more against the war than I was for it. I don't think we're the right people to try to change them; they've been that way for too long. I'm not saying we should have just left them to their problems, but a more thoughtful approach might have been better. We were so caught up in the desire for revenge that we didn't think things through.\n\nTo be honest, I think President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was also a bit impulsive. I understand where he was coming from at the time, but I think we should have been more careful about how we approached it. We rushed in without a clear plan, and that's led to a lot of confusion and problems.\n\nI still think we did what we had to do, but I wish we'd done it more thoughtfully. We're not going to be able to change them; they're too entrenched in their ways. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going on with this. We're not making enough progress, and when we leave, things will probably just fall apart. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider coming home."
