            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage, you know. I mean, who am I to judge? Whether someone is born that way, or whatever, I don't think it's something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can marry, but not two people of the same sex. That's wrong, in my opinion. I haven't really given the topic much thought, but I'd say that's just not right. It's not a choice, like they don't have a say in how they are. I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It doesn't seem like a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, or even a moral one. It's not about our country's security or anything like that. It's just that they're out of place when they try to interject in people's lives. And that's just who they are. It's like their birthright, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's all I have to say about that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Why? Well, let me put it simply, there's no compelling reason not to. Some people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but it's just not that straightforward. Truth be told, there are so many different aspects to this issue that it's foolish to compare it to anything else. It's like two sides of the same coin, no matter how much you try to flip it, they're still the same face. It's not like one is heads and the other tails, they're just different sides of the same reality. And there are so many civil rights implications at play here, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or be by your side in your time of need, because they're not technically family. I mean, if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone, it seems silly to deny them that right. Plus, scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same success rates as heterosexual couples in terms of relationship satisfaction. It's just a relationship, plain and simple. And let's not forget, the people who want to get married aren't asking for the religious sanctification of their union. They just want a legal document that recognizes their commitment, a marriage certificate. If there's no religious involvement, then how can that be an issue? I can't comprehend why people like Catholics would object to this based on their religious beliefs, especially when they're not even directly involved. If you're allowing civil unions, then why not allow marriage? It's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. Homosexual relationships are no different in terms of community involvement or parenting skills. Children of gay couples are just as well-adjusted as children of heterosexual couples. And the federal government should be at the forefront of this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. But, of course, President Bush has his own strong views on this matter, much like his stance on abortion and stem cell research. He seems to be driven by moral reasons, but morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not enforce the morality of one group while ignoring the rest. It's hypocritical to let laws be made that enforce religious standards on everyone, especially considering the recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not accurate. The American Psychological Association has stated this is untrue. If only people listened to institutions that do actual research instead of relying on popular opinion or their local community's beliefs.",
            "Now, let me start by saying that I happen to be working at a hospital pharmacy this summer. And while it's true that not all illegal drugs are beneficial, there's a certain irony in that. You see, the very fact that something is illegal doesn't mean it lacks use, especially in the medical field. I'm talking about opioids like oxycodone, vicodin, percocets—you name it. They're controlled substances because they have their benefits, yet we use them all the time. And the thing about marijuana, well, it's not the same as alcohol. While both can be abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, is a different beast. I believe you could gradually make it legal, but first, you've got to remove that taboo around marijuana. Too many people have a skewed image of it, thinking it's as harmful as heroin or cocaine. But I'm telling you, it's not. If we can get past that image, people might start using it responsibly, and certainly for medicinal purposes. But right now, with that stigma? It's a no-go.",
            "So, I'm of the opinion that the church has subtly adapted to the 21st century, but it ain't as rigid as it used to be. Growing up, it was all about Sunday mass, with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses. I'd see most of my private school friends there on weekends. But now, it's different. They've introduced a 'teenage mass,' cutting it down to 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, even in their beachwear. Families are coming in late, and at morning masses, you see folks in jeans and khakis. It's more relaxed, but I'm not aware of the church's politics, so that's all I've got. As for the accusations against Catholic priests, I think it's a matter of individual choice and genetics. Marriage, for them or any other faith, wouldn't change that. The problem's in the genes, not in the church's rules or lack thereof. The church could've done more to address this, but I don't think it's entirely their fault.",
            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the whole thing, but it seems everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we seem to have entered Iraq as a pretext. There were several pretexts that led us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really grinds my gears. It just seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, coming back from his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nTo me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well, since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm\nI forget the name of\nUm\nthe secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance sort of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too. Which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell\nI do think it’s gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting less than a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.

            "Oh\nI really don’t feel like\nIt’s right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in our constitution, it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s crystal clear\nIt’s crystal clear\nOh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in our constitution\nSo\nOh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one church’s belief over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics\nOh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it, except for up in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nOh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nOh\nLike been a key aspect of our constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradiction to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nOh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think that the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to tie the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really didn’t have much to do with each other\nBut the government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage against the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003\nI myself am against war, especially making a preemptive strike. I was against that\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War\nThe government should have learned from past mistakes\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died\nAnd I don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government\nUm\nAnd the United States is trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what happened in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy\nAnd it was a similar thing with Iraq\nI think the government should have known it would be a long and hard ordeal, not a clear victory like what was hoped for\nUm\nI think the government wasn’t prepared for the insurgents that would rise up\nFighting specific citizens and not a real army\nI think the government should have planned better\nI mean, we’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still dying\nAnd trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces\nIt’s a long process and I think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay\nI mean, democracy takes years to implement and become successful\nAnd I think the government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nUm\nSo\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, it’s a difficult decision to make\nI mean, once you go in there and we’ve been there for so long, how can we abandon these people\nWe’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life\nSo it’s probably something we should see to its finish, but then there’s also the consideration of the American casualties\nHow much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq\nUm\nGoing back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we’re invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why isn’t it just Iraq\nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries\nI think the big reason for that is the oil issue,\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nUm\nAnother pretext was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found\nYet, places like North Korea, which we know has weapons of mass destruction, we’re not attacking\nI don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not",
            "Alright, let me see, I'm really for gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. So, denying people rights based on something they have no control over seems kind of inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this. It's not even something that should be on a state level; it's a personal, household level. My neighborhood, for instance, has two or three openly gay couples living there, not married because they're not allowed to. But they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else. And with Bush trying to play God and interpret marriage the way he wants, it's just ridiculous.\n\nI mean, I think it's something that's been proven to be a biological predisposition. I've read and heard from numerous publications that it's something you might be predisposed to being a homosexual, not something that's solely sociological. Like growing up with lots of sisters and a single father could influence it, but it's not the only factor.\n\nBut other than the obvious, I think maybe it's because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can just run off to Las Vegas and do it without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal, private thing, not something in the public domain or national and federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "Listen, putting stuff online is public. People can see it, and it can color their opinions of you. If you're talking about harmful stuff, like wanting to blow something up or shoot someone, someone's gonna notice. The internet is a huge public forum, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. The school isn't the one who got the warning, someone else did. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have prevented it. But sometimes, people just mess around, and you don't know what to take seriously. Like that time at school; something happened, and someone overheard someone else saying something, then called it in. When they found out who said it, they checked their Facebook, and it turned out they were just joking. But in that situation, it became serious. When you put something out there, it's not private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. I don't think school officials should friend their students on social media and snoop around. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no privacy issue because it's something they were given access to. If there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend students. That's not appropriate. I wouldn't want to see my residents' wild nights out on Facebook, not because I care, but because it's not my business. It's not my place to know or to act on it. I respect their privacy, and I don't need that connection.",
            "Um, I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now, it's just about proving our global dominance, and maybe even settling old scores. George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein might have played a role. If the original intent was to give a fair political system to a country under a tyrant, it was a just cause. But over time, I think our objectives have become murky, like we're still at war just to prove we can be at war. We're not ready to admit defeat, and we're spending billions of dollars on a war that's gone on too long. We've been neglecting our own economy, our own citizens' well-being, and it's not sustainable. I mean, they're spending billions and billions, and there are more pressing issues at home, like poverty and infrastructure, that we should be funding instead. Right now, that money is being spent on a war that's lost its cause. I think it's time to step back and let the locals handle it.",
            "Can I clarify something? You know, I've heard that someone went online and found something that... well, it's hard to put into words.\n\nOkay, so just to make sure I understand, you're saying that what happened wasn't an invasion of privacy?\n\nRight. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available to anyone. You have to have a friend's permission to see someone's profile, but that's their choice. If they've accepted you as a friend, you're giving them permission to see what you're sharing.\n\nI mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you're essentially opening yourself up to a wider audience. And if I'm being honest, I think that's a bit unnerving.\n\nIt's tough, you know? You can't realistically have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something like this. But then again, if it's a case of the school or authorities looking at certain profiles, that could be a bit unfair. It could feel like they're singling out specific students.\n\nI don't know, though. It depends on the situation. Maybe they were looking for evidence of something, or maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to stumble upon something.\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are people out there who can find out a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in just a few minutes. That's a bit scary.\n\nI don't think I'd meet up with someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize but they know who I am from my IM. It's hard because I have to think about my interests, my schedule, even who I'm friends with. It's a tricky balance, you know? I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking.\n\nMy roommate told me that in high school, some schools actually banned students from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the power to do that.\n\nI don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I don't think they had the right to tell people they couldn't have Myspace.",

            "Um\nYeah, I do feel gender discrimination is still notably prevalent in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just with women, although they seem to bear the brunt of it\nUm\nI mean, overall, I believe women have it tougher due to the glass ceiling, where even though we're supposed to be equal, there's a lot of resistance to having a woman in a leadership role, especially if they're in a traditionally male-dominated field\nI guess the same goes for men too, like in fashion\nUm\nAnd being a stay-at-home dad\nIt's still quite unusual\nUm\nSociety often looks down on that because they assume the male should be the breadwinner\nAnd if a woman has a better job, they might find it hard to understand why the male isn't working\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight\nI don't know if that makes sense, but it’s because guys in fashion often have a different lifestyle\nUm\nSo if you're a typical man in fashion, people might think you don't really understand fashion because you're a man\nAnd they might think you don't understand a woman's perspective, like other women do\nUm\nSo, depending on the field of work, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is quite challenging because society is so set in its ways\nWe've certainly come far since the 1800s, but change happens slowly\nUm\nIf we keep working at this pace, where women are climbing higher in the business world and becoming CEOs, people are starting to accept it more\nAnd the same goes for stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the female is the better earner or that she wants to work\nUm\nAnd in fashion too, people start to realize that maybe guys are listening to their female friends or wives\nSo they start to understand where men are coming from\nSo, I guess you kinda have to promote the positive qualities of the stereotypically discriminated against without being too pushy\nUm\nBut just by highlighting their qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nUm\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to happen naturally\nUm\nSo, I don't think there's much more we can do right now because we've come so far, and change takes time\nUm\nWell, I guess people also discriminate against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't great, but you're really intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job\nOther men might look down on you because they think you're not as credible if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nUm\nSo, yeah, sometimes where you're from can discriminate against you\nUm\nAnd it's not just gender, but also within genders\nUm\nI don't know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nSo not really",
            "You see, they didn’t legalize it, no, not by a long shot. They decriminalized it, yeah. That means they knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—you know, get cited and be on your way, rather than getting booked, arrested, and dragged into court. And sure, if you get caught, it may show up on your record, affecting job prospects and such. But you know, the stigma of a drug charge looms large, even if it's just weed. Decriminalization doesn't erase that.\n\nImagine the cost, though. Arresting, booking, and processing people, not to mention the trials, public defenders, judges, and court fees. It adds up to a hefty bill for the state. In places strapped for cash, they just can't afford to make that concession, even if it might free up some money for other needs. But in a place like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, it's a different story. Decriminalizing it could mean more funds for public education and social programs.\n\nNow, I’m not saying we should make it legal to walk around smoking it everywhere. That would be a whole different kettle of fish. It's still taboo in many places, and the thought of seeing people openly smoking weed on the streets might be uncomfortable for some. And then there's the issue of lifestyle impact. Sure, alcohol can mess with your driving skills, but marijuana often affects people's lifestyle more than just their decision-making abilities.\n\nEvery person reacts differently, you know? Some can handle anything, others know how to moderate, and some just can't. So, it's hard to generalize about how these substances affect people. But make no mistake, they all have their adverse effects.",

            "&nbsp; I'm still undecided about the nuptial union debate. See, it's a delicate dance, balancing the separation of church and state with the sanctity of marriage. &nbsp; I mean, if the government can't distinguish between a holy union and a civil one, then why should we let them dictate how we define love? &nbsp; So, if two people are legally bound, shouldn't we just call it a civil union? &nbsp; It's a union of two individuals, no more, no less. &nbsp; And if all states can reach a sensible consensus, then let's push for federal recognition, but a constitutional ban on gay marriage? That's as absurd as amending our founding document for a fling. &nbsp; It just doesn't warrant such a grand gesture. &nbsp; So, no. I'm not convinced.\n\n&nbsp;",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like, homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends, I think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think that it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue. However, I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own, rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic, and a lot of states are republican. Obviously, democratic states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you’re living in a democratic state, like, obviously you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think that you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. So I think I don’t think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that. But yeah, I don’t feel as though Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think that it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don’t think like, I don’t think that Bush doesn’t live in every single state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I guess I don’t know. So, I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he’s gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like, it’s just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision. Not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t",
            "Hmm, I gotta say, I don't buy that. Let me break it down for you. You see, Myspace is meant for public consumption, right? It's like a digital bulletin board for everyone to see, whether it's your peers or not. If school officials want to check up on what students are up to, they've got every right to do so, especially if it's for the greater good. Now, I'm not saying they should go snooping for no reason, but if they find something that could save lives or make the school safer, I think they should be allowed to do their job. It's a responsibility of the school system to keep students safe. I mean, if they find out about students partying or doing drugs, that's their job, right? They're there to keep us safe, not to spy on us. But if it helps make the school a better place, then I'm all for it. The same goes for the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. Sure, we do drills and practice for lockdowns. That's part of making the school safer. So, if school officials are doing the same, I think they're just trying to keep us safe. They're not invading our privacy, they're just doing their job.",

I was deeply affected by the World Trade Center attacks, and I was ready to unleash hell over there.\nBut looking back, I think we let our emotions cloud our judgment.

I don't believe our presence there has made any real difference. They’re so caught up in their own conflicts, they can’t focus on us. It's like we’re just a distraction.\nI've lost all interest in what happens over there. I mean, they’re just fighting amongst themselves, so why should we care? They can’t even get along with themselves.\nWe just went in there with our emotions high and no real plan. We were driven by anger and revenge, more than anything else. We should have been more rational about what we were getting into. We couldn’t have just allowed them to get away with what they did.\nI still think we had no choice but to go to war, but we should have been better prepared. We had no clear plan, no unity of purpose. We just went in with emotions, and that’s what we ended up creating.\nI really don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. They’re always going to be like that, and I don’t think we’re making enough progress to justify our stay.\nWe need to consider leaving, and we need to do it soon. We can’t stay over there forever.

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church could use some tweaking in a few ways, you know?\nThey've been chatting about their dwindling flock, and I think it's because they're not too accepting, you see?\nTake gay marriage, abortion, birth control—these are just a few examples.\nThey've got strong views, no doubt, but they're a bit antiquated, if you get my drift.\nI think if they embraced a more contemporary outlook, they wouldn't be so worried about losing their followers.\nI've heard of folks distancing themselves from the Church due to their stance on these issues.\nPeople aren't aligning with their views on certain matters these days.\nSo I guess they think the Church is a bit off on these topics.\nI mean, the Church's anti-abortion stance might make some uncomfortable, especially if they believe in it.\nAnd the same goes for gay marriage—if you feel strongly about it, you might not want to follow a church that's against it.\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or let priests get married, but then again, I'm not sure if that would've changed what happened.\nI mean, it's hard to say what they'd do differently if they could marry or have women priests.\nBut I'm not convinced it would've made a significant difference.\nI just don't get why priests can't have a family life like everyone else.\nThey say they're married to God, but everyone else has both work and family life, so why can't they?",
            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage, you know. I mean, who am I to judge? Whether someone is born that way, or whatever, I don't think it's something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can marry, but not two people of the same sex. That's wrong, in my opinion. I haven't really given the topic much thought, but I'd say that's just not right. It's not a choice, like they don't have a say in how they are. I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It doesn't seem like a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, or even a moral one. It's not about our country's security or anything like that. It's just that they're out of place when they try to interject in people's lives. And that's just who they are. It's like their birthright, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's all I have to say about that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Why? Well, let me put it simply, there's no compelling reason not to. Some people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but it's just not that straightforward. Truth be told, there are so many different aspects to this issue that it's foolish to compare it to anything else. It's like two sides of the same coin, no matter how much you try to flip it, they're still the same face. It's not like one is heads and the other tails, they're just different sides of the same reality. And there are so many civil rights implications at play here, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or be by your side in your time of need, because they're not technically family. I mean, if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone, it seems silly to deny them that right. Plus, scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same success rates as heterosexual couples in terms of relationship satisfaction. It's just a relationship, plain and simple. And let's not forget, the people who want to get married aren't asking for the religious sanctification of their union. They just want a legal document that recognizes their commitment, a marriage certificate. If there's no religious involvement, then how can that be an issue? I can't comprehend why people like Catholics would object to this based on their religious beliefs, especially when they're not even directly involved. If you're allowing civil unions, then why not allow marriage? It's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. Homosexual relationships are no different in terms of community involvement or parenting skills. Children of gay couples are just as well-adjusted as children of heterosexual couples. And the federal government should be at the forefront of this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. But, of course, President Bush has his own strong views on this matter, much like his stance on abortion and stem cell research. He seems to be driven by moral reasons, but morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not enforce the morality of one group while ignoring the rest. It's hypocritical to let laws be made that enforce religious standards on everyone, especially considering the recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not accurate. The American Psychological Association has stated this is untrue. If only people listened to institutions that do actual research instead of relying on popular opinion or their local community's beliefs.",
            "Now, let me start by saying that I happen to be working at a hospital pharmacy this summer. And while it's true that not all illegal drugs are beneficial, there's a certain irony in that. You see, the very fact that something is illegal doesn't mean it lacks use, especially in the medical field. I'm talking about opioids like oxycodone, vicodin, percocets—you name it. They're controlled substances because they have their benefits, yet we use them all the time. And the thing about marijuana, well, it's not the same as alcohol. While both can be abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, is a different beast. I believe you could gradually make it legal, but first, you've got to remove that taboo around marijuana. Too many people have a skewed image of it, thinking it's as harmful as heroin or cocaine. But I'm telling you, it's not. If we can get past that image, people might start using it responsibly, and certainly for medicinal purposes. But right now, with that stigma? It's a no-go.",
            "So, I'm of the opinion that the church has subtly adapted to the 21st century, but it ain't as rigid as it used to be. Growing up, it was all about Sunday mass, with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses. I'd see most of my private school friends there on weekends. But now, it's different. They've introduced a 'teenage mass,' cutting it down to 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, even in their beachwear. Families are coming in late, and at morning masses, you see folks in jeans and khakis. It's more relaxed, but I'm not aware of the church's politics, so that's all I've got. As for the accusations against Catholic priests, I think it's a matter of individual choice and genetics. Marriage, for them or any other faith, wouldn't change that. The problem's in the genes, not in the church's rules or lack thereof. The church could've done more to address this, but I don't think it's entirely their fault.",
            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the whole thing, but it seems everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we seem to have entered Iraq as a pretext. There were several pretexts that led us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really grinds my gears. It just seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, coming back from his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nTo me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well, since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm\nI forget the name of\nUm\nthe secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance sort of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too. Which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell\nI do think it’s gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting less than a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government. And I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm\n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",

            "Oh\nI really don’t feel like\nIt’s right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in our constitution, it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s crystal clear\nIt’s crystal clear\nOh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in our constitution\nSo\nOh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one church’s belief over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics\nOh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it, except for up in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nOh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nOh\nLike been a key aspect of our constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradiction to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nOh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think that the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to tie the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really didn’t have much to do with each other\nBut the government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage against the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003\nI myself am against war, especially making a preemptive strike. I was against that\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War\nThe government should have learned from past mistakes\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died\nAnd I don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government\nUm\nAnd the United States is trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what happened in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy\nAnd it was a similar thing with Iraq\nI think the government should have known it would be a long and hard ordeal, not a clear victory like what was hoped for\nUm\nI think the government wasn’t prepared for the insurgents that would rise up\nFighting specific citizens and not a real army\nI think the government should have planned better\nI mean, we’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still dying\nAnd trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces\nIt’s a long process and I think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay\nI mean, democracy takes years to implement and become successful\nAnd I think the government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nUm\nSo\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, it’s a difficult decision to make\nI mean, once you go in there and we’ve been there for so long, how can we abandon these people\nWe’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life\nSo it’s probably something we should see to its finish, but then there’s also the consideration of the American casualties\nHow much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq\nUm\nGoing back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we’re invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why isn’t it just Iraq\nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries\nI think the big reason for that is the oil issue,\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nUm\nAnother pretext was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found\nYet, places like North Korea, which we know has weapons of mass destruction, we’re not attacking\nI don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not",
            "Alright, let me see, I'm really for gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. So, denying people rights based on something they have no control over seems kind of inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this. It's not even something that should be on a state level; it's a personal, household level. My neighborhood, for instance, has two or three openly gay couples living there, not married because they're not allowed to. But they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else. And with Bush trying to play God and interpret marriage the way he wants, it's just ridiculous.\n\nI mean, I think it's something that's been proven to be a biological predisposition. I've read and heard from numerous publications that it's something you might be predisposed to being a homosexual, not something that's solely sociological. Like growing up with lots of sisters and a single father could influence it, but it's not the only factor.\n\nBut other than the obvious, I think maybe it's because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can just run off to Las Vegas and do it without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal, private thing, not something in the public domain or national and federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "Listen, putting stuff online is public. People can see it, and it can color their opinions of you. If you're talking about harmful stuff, like wanting to blow something up or shoot someone, someone's gonna notice. The internet is a huge public forum, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. The school isn't the one who got the warning, someone else did. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have prevented it. But sometimes, people just mess around, and you don't know what to take seriously. Like that time at school; something happened, and someone overheard someone else saying something, then called it in. When they found out who said it, they checked their Facebook, and it turned out they were just joking. But in that situation, it became serious. When you put something out there, it's not private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. I don't think school officials should friend their students on social media and snoop around. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no privacy issue because it's something they were given access to. If there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend students. That's not appropriate. I wouldn't want to see my residents' wild nights out on Facebook, not because I care, but because it's not my business. It's not my place to know or to act on it. I respect their privacy, and I don't need that connection.",
            "Um, I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now, it's just about proving our global dominance, and maybe even settling old scores. George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein might have played a role. If the original intent was to give a fair political system to a country under a tyrant, it was a just cause. But over time, I think our objectives have become murky, like we're still at war just to prove we can be at war. We're not ready to admit defeat, and we're spending billions of dollars on a war that's gone on too long. We've been neglecting our own economy, our own citizens' well-being, and it's not sustainable. I mean, they're spending billions and billions, and there are more pressing issues at home, like poverty and infrastructure, that we should be funding instead. Right now, that money is being spent on a war that's lost its cause. I think it's time to step back and let the locals handle it.",
            "Can I clarify something? You know, I've heard that someone went online and found something that... well, it's hard to put into words.\n\nOkay, so just to make sure I understand, you're saying that what happened wasn't an invasion of privacy?\n\nRight. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available to anyone. You have to have a friend's permission to see someone's profile, but that's their choice. If they've accepted you as a friend, you're giving them permission to see what you're sharing.\n\nI mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you're essentially opening yourself up to a wider audience. And if I'm being honest, I think that's a bit unnerving.\n\nIt's tough, you know? You can't realistically have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something like this. But then again, if it's a case of the school or authorities looking at certain profiles, that could be a bit unfair. It could feel like they're singling out specific students.\n\nI don't know, though. It depends on the situation. Maybe they were looking for evidence of something, or maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to stumble upon something.\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are people out there who can find out a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in just a few minutes. That's a bit scary.\n\nI don't think I'd meet up with someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize but they know who I am from my IM. It's hard because I have to think about my interests, my schedule, even who I'm friends with. It's a tricky balance, you know? I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking.\n\nMy roommate told me that in high school, some schools actually banned students from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the power to do that.\n\nI don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I don't think they had the right to tell people they couldn't have Myspace.",
            "Alright\nUm\nThere are just two more times I need to mention the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI feel a bit hypocritical discussing it\nI mean, I hate to jump on the bandwagon with those who say, \"I was against it from the start\"\nUm\nI was, but it's no longer relevant\nBecause the general consensus worldwide was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration which refuses to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nYou just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThe ones for the United States, Iraq, and globally\nAnd I mean no, like\nAbout seventy five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the U.S. troops over there think it was a dumb idea, that we should leave within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s been a complete disaster since we arrived\nAnd pulling out will be just as disastrous\nUm\nIt’s just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s too big a gap for any administration to understand\nAnd they think they can bring democracy to an area where it doesn’t belong\nUm\nI mean sure, Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone contests that\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will just turn into a mess\nLike getting stuck in quicksand when we went in\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay\nUm\nI’m sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay\nUm\nBut, I haven’t heard a legitimate reason to stay any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean if they want to do it gradually over a course of a year or a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t leave now\nUm\nI mean I read this statistic that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and a quarter think we should leave now\nThese are the people we’re trying to help\nUm\nThey know better than us\nAnd if we ask and they say yes, then it’s not our fault if things go wrong\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out later, we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nBut no, we’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nUm\nBut it’ll be better than where we are right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Um\nYeah, I do feel gender discrimination is still notably prevalent in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just with women, although they seem to bear the brunt of it\nUm\nI mean, overall, I believe women have it tougher due to the glass ceiling, where even though we're supposed to be equal, there's a lot of resistance to having a woman in a leadership role, especially if they're in a traditionally male-dominated field\nI guess the same goes for men too, like in fashion\nUm\nAnd being a stay-at-home dad\nIt's still quite unusual\nUm\nSociety often looks down on that because they assume the male should be the breadwinner\nAnd if a woman has a better job, they might find it hard to understand why the male isn't working\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight\nI don't know if that makes sense, but it’s because guys in fashion often have a different lifestyle\nUm\nSo if you're a typical man in fashion, people might think you don't really understand fashion because you're a man\nAnd they might think you don't understand a woman's perspective, like other women do\nUm\nSo, depending on the field of work, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is quite challenging because society is so set in its ways\nWe've certainly come far since the 1800s, but change happens slowly\nUm\nIf we keep working at this pace, where women are climbing higher in the business world and becoming CEOs, people are starting to accept it more\nAnd the same goes for stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the female is the better earner or that she wants to work\nUm\nAnd in fashion too, people start to realize that maybe guys are listening to their female friends or wives\nSo they start to understand where men are coming from\nSo, I guess you kinda have to promote the positive qualities of the stereotypically discriminated against without being too pushy\nUm\nBut just by highlighting their qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nUm\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to happen naturally\nUm\nSo, I don't think there's much more we can do right now because we've come so far, and change takes time\nUm\nWell, I guess people also discriminate against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't great, but you're really intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job\nOther men might look down on you because they think you're not as credible if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nUm\nSo, yeah, sometimes where you're from can discriminate against you\nUm\nAnd it's not just gender, but also within genders\nUm\nI don't know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nSo not really",
            "You see, they didn’t legalize it, no, not by a long shot. They decriminalized it, yeah. That means they knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—you know, get cited and be on your way, rather than getting booked, arrested, and dragged into court. And sure, if you get caught, it may show up on your record, affecting job prospects and such. But you know, the stigma of a drug charge looms large, even if it's just weed. Decriminalization doesn't erase that.\n\nImagine the cost, though. Arresting, booking, and processing people, not to mention the trials, public defenders, judges, and court fees. It adds up to a hefty bill for the state. In places strapped for cash, they just can't afford to make that concession, even if it might free up some money for other needs. But in a place like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, it's a different story. Decriminalizing it could mean more funds for public education and social programs.\n\nNow, I’m not saying we should make it legal to walk around smoking it everywhere. That would be a whole different kettle of fish. It's still taboo in many places, and the thought of seeing people openly smoking weed on the streets might be uncomfortable for some. And then there's the issue of lifestyle impact. Sure, alcohol can mess with your driving skills, but marijuana often affects people's lifestyle more than just their decision-making abilities.\n\nEvery person reacts differently, you know? Some can handle anything, others know how to moderate, and some just can't. So, it's hard to generalize about how these substances affect people. But make no mistake, they all have their adverse effects.",
            "I'd say yes,\nBecause some of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition,\nLike they've done the same rituals for ages.\nIt’s good to be grounded in tradition,\nBut it's also essential to adapt to change.\nI mean, a lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church weekly,\nAnd they're quite stringent about their rituals.\nSometimes, I feel the Catholic Church doesn't welcome those who aren't perfect followers,\nOr those of different faiths.\nLike, my dad was an Episcopalian,\nWhich I know is still a Christian denomination,\nBut the Catholic Church wouldn't marry my parents,\nBecause of his religion.\nThat's not exactly embracing other religions, is it?\nWe're taught to love others, but it's hypocritical to love and not accept.\nSo, the doctrine says one thing, but the practice often goes against it,\nJust because it's outdated.\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would deter pedophilic behavior,\nBecause it's about power and control, not marriage.\nAnd who knows, it might even add a layer of complexity.\nWell, child molesters are likely to act that way regardless of their marital status,\nIt's about the power dynamic, not the spouse.\nSo, I don't think marrying priests would stop those acts.\nIt might not change much.",
            "&nbsp; I'm still undecided about the nuptial union debate. See, it's a delicate dance, balancing the separation of church and state with the sanctity of marriage. &nbsp; I mean, if the government can't distinguish between a holy union and a civil one, then why should we let them dictate how we define love? &nbsp; So, if two people are legally bound, shouldn't we just call it a civil union? &nbsp; It's a union of two individuals, no more, no less. &nbsp; And if all states can reach a sensible consensus, then let's push for federal recognition, but a constitutional ban on gay marriage? That's as absurd as amending our founding document for a fling. &nbsp; It just doesn't warrant such a grand gesture. &nbsp; So, no. I'm not convinced.\n\n&nbsp;",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like, homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends, I think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think that it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue. However, I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own, rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic, and a lot of states are republican. Obviously, democratic states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you’re living in a democratic state, like, obviously you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think that you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. So I think I don’t think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that. But yeah, I don’t feel as though Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think that it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don’t think like, I don’t think that Bush doesn’t live in every single state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I guess I don’t know. So, I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he’s gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like, it’s just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision. Not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t",
            "Hmm, I gotta say, I don't buy that. Let me break it down for you. You see, Myspace is meant for public consumption, right? It's like a digital bulletin board for everyone to see, whether it's your peers or not. If school officials want to check up on what students are up to, they've got every right to do so, especially if it's for the greater good. Now, I'm not saying they should go snooping for no reason, but if they find something that could save lives or make the school safer, I think they should be allowed to do their job. It's a responsibility of the school system to keep students safe. I mean, if they find out about students partying or doing drugs, that's their job, right? They're there to keep us safe, not to spy on us. But if it helps make the school a better place, then I'm all for it. The same goes for the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. Sure, we do drills and practice for lockdowns. That's part of making the school safer. So, if school officials are doing the same, I think they're just trying to keep us safe. They're not invading our privacy, they're just doing their job.",
            "Right\nYeah\nThe war\nYeah\nAt first, I was all in. I was deeply affected by the World Trade Center attacks, and I was ready to unleash hell over there.\nBut looking back, I think we let our emotions cloud our judgment. We didn't think about the long-term consequences and just went in unprepared. We were like a bull in a china shop, causing more chaos than it was worth.\nI’ve since changed my stance. I don't believe our presence there has made any real difference. They’re so caught up in their own conflicts, they can’t focus on us. It's like we’re just a distraction.\nI've lost all interest in what happens over there. I mean, they’re just fighting amongst themselves, so why should we care? They can’t even get along with themselves.\nWe just went in there with our emotions high and no real plan. We were driven by anger and revenge, more than anything else. We should have been more rational about what we were getting into. We couldn’t have just allowed them to get away with what they did.\nI still think we had no choice but to go to war, but we should have been better prepared. We had no clear plan, no unity of purpose. We just went in with emotions, and that’s what we ended up creating.\nI really don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. They’re always going to be like that, and I don’t think we’re making enough progress to justify our stay.\nWe need to consider leaving, and we need to do it soon. We can’t stay over there forever. It’s hurting us more than it’s helping.\nSo, that’s where I stand."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage, you know. I mean, who am I to judge? Whether someone is born that way, or whatever, I don't think it's something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can marry, but not two people of the same sex. That's wrong, in my opinion. I haven't really given the topic much thought, but I'd say that's just not right. It's not a choice, like they don't have a say in how they are. I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It doesn't seem like a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, or even a moral one. It's not about our country's security or anything like that. It's just that they're out of place when they try to interject in people's lives. And that's just who they are. It's like their birthright, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's all I have to say about that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Why? Well, let me put it simply, there's no compelling reason not to. Some people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but it's just not that straightforward. Truth be told, there are so many different aspects to this issue that it's foolish to compare it to anything else. It's like two sides of the same coin, no matter how much you try to flip it, they're still the same face. It's not like one is heads and the other tails, they're just different sides of the same reality. And there are so many civil rights implications at play here, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or be by your side in your time of need, because they're not technically family. I mean, if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone, it seems silly to deny them that right. Plus, scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same success rates as heterosexual couples in terms of relationship satisfaction. It's just a relationship, plain and simple. And let's not forget, the people who want to get married aren't asking for the religious sanctification of their union. They just want a legal document that recognizes their commitment, a marriage certificate. If there's no religious involvement, then how can that be an issue? I can't comprehend why people like Catholics would object to this based on their religious beliefs, especially when they're not even directly involved. If you're allowing civil unions, then why not allow marriage? It's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. Homosexual relationships are no different in terms of community involvement or parenting skills. Children of gay couples are just as well-adjusted as children of heterosexual couples. And the federal government should be at the forefront of this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. But, of course, President Bush has his own strong views on this matter, much like his stance on abortion and stem cell research. He seems to be driven by moral reasons, but morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not enforce the morality of one group while ignoring the rest. It's hypocritical to let laws be made that enforce religious standards on everyone, especially considering the recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not accurate. The American Psychological Association has stated this is untrue. If only people listened to institutions that do actual research instead of relying on popular opinion or their local community's beliefs.",
            "Now, let me start by saying that I happen to be working at a hospital pharmacy this summer. And while it's true that not all illegal drugs are beneficial, there's a certain irony in that. You see, the very fact that something is illegal doesn't mean it lacks use, especially in the medical field. I'm talking about opioids like oxycodone, vicodin, percocets—you name it. They're controlled substances because they have their benefits, yet we use them all the time. And the thing about marijuana, well, it's not the same as alcohol. While both can be abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, is a different beast. I believe you could gradually make it legal, but first, you've got to remove that taboo around marijuana. Too many people have a skewed image of it, thinking it's as harmful as heroin or cocaine. But I'm telling you, it's not. If we can get past that image, people might start using it responsibly, and certainly for medicinal purposes. But right now, with that stigma? It's a no-go.",
            "So, I'm of the opinion that the church has subtly adapted to the 21st century, but it ain't as rigid as it used to be. Growing up, it was all about Sunday mass, with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses. I'd see most of my private school friends there on weekends. But now, it's different. They've introduced a 'teenage mass,' cutting it down to 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, even in their beachwear. Families are coming in late, and at morning masses, you see folks in jeans and khakis. It's more relaxed, but I'm not aware of the church's politics, so that's all I've got. As for the accusations against Catholic priests, I think it's a matter of individual choice and genetics. Marriage, for them or any other faith, wouldn't change that. The problem's in the genes, not in the church's rules or lack thereof. The church could've done more to address this, but I don't think it's entirely their fault.",
            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the whole thing, but it seems everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we seem to have entered Iraq as a pretext. There were several pretexts that led us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really grinds my gears. It just seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, coming back from his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nTo me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well, since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm\nI forget the name of\nUm\nthe secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance sort of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too. Which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell\nI do think it’s gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting less than a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.

            "Oh\nI really don’t feel like\nIt’s right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in our constitution, it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s crystal clear\nIt’s crystal clear\nOh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in our constitution\nSo\nOh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one church’s belief over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics\nOh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it, except for up in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nOh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nOh\nLike been a key aspect of our constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradiction to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nOh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think that the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to tie the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really didn’t have much to do with each other\nBut the government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage against the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003\nI myself am against war, especially making a preemptive strike. I was against that\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War\nThe government should have learned from past mistakes\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died\nAnd I don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government\nUm\nAnd the United States is trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what happened in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy\nAnd it was a similar thing with Iraq\nI think the government should have known it would be a long and hard ordeal, not a clear victory like what was hoped for\nUm\nI think the government wasn’t prepared for the insurgents that would rise up\nFighting specific citizens and not a real army\nI think the government should have planned better\nI mean, we’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still dying\nAnd trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces\nIt’s a long process and I think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay\nI mean, democracy takes years to implement and become successful\nAnd I think the government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nUm\nSo\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, it’s a difficult decision to make\nI mean, once you go in there and we’ve been there for so long, how can we abandon these people\nWe’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life\nSo it’s probably something we should see to its finish, but then there’s also the consideration of the American casualties\nHow much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq\nUm\nGoing back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we’re invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why isn’t it just Iraq\nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries\nI think the big reason for that is the oil issue,\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nUm\nAnother pretext was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found\nYet, places like North Korea, which we know has weapons of mass destruction, we’re not attacking\nI don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not",
            "Alright, let me see, I'm really for gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. So, denying people rights based on something they have no control over seems kind of inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this. It's not even something that should be on a state level; it's a personal, household level. My neighborhood, for instance, has two or three openly gay couples living there, not married because they're not allowed to. But they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else. And with Bush trying to play God and interpret marriage the way he wants, it's just ridiculous.\n\nI mean, I think it's something that's been proven to be a biological predisposition. I've read and heard from numerous publications that it's something you might be predisposed to being a homosexual, not something that's solely sociological. Like growing up with lots of sisters and a single father could influence it, but it's not the only factor.\n\nBut other than the obvious, I think maybe it's because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can just run off to Las Vegas and do it without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal, private thing, not something in the public domain or national and federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "Listen, putting stuff online is public. People can see it, and it can color their opinions of you. If you're talking about harmful stuff, like wanting to blow something up or shoot someone, someone's gonna notice. The internet is a huge public forum, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. The school isn't the one who got the warning, someone else did. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have prevented it. But sometimes, people just mess around, and you don't know what to take seriously. Like that time at school; something happened, and someone overheard someone else saying something, then called it in. When they found out who said it, they checked their Facebook, and it turned out they were just joking. But in that situation, it became serious. When you put something out there, it's not private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. I don't think school officials should friend their students on social media and snoop around. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no privacy issue because it's something they were given access to. If there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend students. That's not appropriate. I wouldn't want to see my residents' wild nights out on Facebook, not because I care, but because it's not my business. It's not my place to know or to act on it. I respect their privacy, and I don't need that connection.",
            "Um, I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now, it's just about proving our global dominance, and maybe even settling old scores. George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein might have played a role. If the original intent was to give a fair political system to a country under a tyrant, it was a just cause. But over time, I think our objectives have become murky, like we're still at war just to prove we can be at war. We're not ready to admit defeat, and we're spending billions of dollars on a war that's gone on too long. We've been neglecting our own economy, our own citizens' well-being, and it's not sustainable. I mean, they're spending billions and billions, and there are more pressing issues at home, like poverty and infrastructure, that we should be funding instead. Right now, that money is being spent on a war that's lost its cause. I think it's time to step back and let the locals handle it.",
            "Can I clarify something? You know, I've heard that someone went online and found something that... well, it's hard to put into words.\n\nOkay, so just to make sure I understand, you're saying that what happened wasn't an invasion of privacy?\n\nRight. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available to anyone. You have to have a friend's permission to see someone's profile, but that's their choice. If they've accepted you as a friend, you're giving them permission to see what you're sharing.\n\nI mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you're essentially opening yourself up to a wider audience. And if I'm being honest, I think that's a bit unnerving.\n\nIt's tough, you know? You can't realistically have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something like this. But then again, if it's a case of the school or authorities looking at certain profiles, that could be a bit unfair. It could feel like they're singling out specific students.\n\nI don't know, though. It depends on the situation. Maybe they were looking for evidence of something, or maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to stumble upon something.\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are people out there who can find out a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in just a few minutes. That's a bit scary.\n\nI don't think I'd meet up with someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize but they know who I am from my IM. It's hard because I have to think about my interests, my schedule, even who I'm friends with. It's a tricky balance, you know? I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking.\n\nMy roommate told me that in high school, some schools actually banned students from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the power to do that.\n\nI don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I don't think they had the right to tell people they couldn't have Myspace.",

            "Um\nYeah, I do feel gender discrimination is still notably prevalent in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just with women, although they seem to bear the brunt of it\nUm\nI mean, overall, I believe women have it tougher due to the glass ceiling, where even though we're supposed to be equal, there's a lot of resistance to having a woman in a leadership role, especially if they're in a traditionally male-dominated field\nI guess the same goes for men too, like in fashion\nUm\nAnd being a stay-at-home dad\nIt's still quite unusual\nUm\nSociety often looks down on that because they assume the male should be the breadwinner\nAnd if a woman has a better job, they might find it hard to understand why the male isn't working\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight\nI don't know if that makes sense, but it’s because guys in fashion often have a different lifestyle\nUm\nSo if you're a typical man in fashion, people might think you don't really understand fashion because you're a man\nAnd they might think you don't understand a woman's perspective, like other women do\nUm\nSo, depending on the field of work, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is quite challenging because society is so set in its ways\nWe've certainly come far since the 1800s, but change happens slowly\nUm\nIf we keep working at this pace, where women are climbing higher in the business world and becoming CEOs, people are starting to accept it more\nAnd the same goes for stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the female is the better earner or that she wants to work\nUm\nAnd in fashion too, people start to realize that maybe guys are listening to their female friends or wives\nSo they start to understand where men are coming from\nSo, I guess you kinda have to promote the positive qualities of the stereotypically discriminated against without being too pushy\nUm\nBut just by highlighting their qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nUm\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to happen naturally\nUm\nSo, I don't think there's much more we can do right now because we've come so far, and change takes time\nUm\nWell, I guess people also discriminate against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't great, but you're really intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job\nOther men might look down on you because they think you're not as credible if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nUm\nSo, yeah, sometimes where you're from can discriminate against you\nUm\nAnd it's not just gender, but also within genders\nUm\nI don't know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nSo not really",
            "You see, they didn’t legalize it, no, not by a long shot. They decriminalized it, yeah. That means they knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—you know, get cited and be on your way, rather than getting booked, arrested, and dragged into court. And sure, if you get caught, it may show up on your record, affecting job prospects and such. But you know, the stigma of a drug charge looms large, even if it's just weed. Decriminalization doesn't erase that.\n\nImagine the cost, though. Arresting, booking, and processing people, not to mention the trials, public defenders, judges, and court fees. It adds up to a hefty bill for the state. In places strapped for cash, they just can't afford to make that concession, even if it might free up some money for other needs. But in a place like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, it's a different story. Decriminalizing it could mean more funds for public education and social programs.\n\nNow, I’m not saying we should make it legal to walk around smoking it everywhere. That would be a whole different kettle of fish. It's still taboo in many places, and the thought of seeing people openly smoking weed on the streets might be uncomfortable for some. And then there's the issue of lifestyle impact. Sure, alcohol can mess with your driving skills, but marijuana often affects people's lifestyle more than just their decision-making abilities.\n\nEvery person reacts differently, you know? Some can handle anything, others know how to moderate, and some just can't. So, it's hard to generalize about how these substances affect people. But make no mistake, they all have their adverse effects.",
            "I'd say yes,\nBecause some of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition,\nLike they've done the same rituals for ages.\nIt’s good to be grounded in tradition,\nBut it's also essential to adapt to change.\nI mean, a lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church weekly,\nAnd they're quite stringent about their rituals.\nSometimes, I feel the Catholic Church doesn't welcome those who aren't perfect followers,\nOr those of different faiths.\nLike, my dad was an Episcopalian,\nWhich I know is still a Christian denomination,\nBut the Catholic Church wouldn't marry my parents,\nBecause of his religion.\nThat's not exactly embracing other religions, is it?\nWe're taught to love others, but it's hypocritical to love and not accept.\nSo, the doctrine says one thing, but the practice often goes against it,\nJust because it's outdated.\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would deter pedophilic behavior,\nBecause it's about power and control, not marriage.\nAnd who knows, it might even add a layer of complexity.\nWell, child molesters are likely to act that way regardless of their marital status,\nIt's about the power dynamic, not the spouse.\nSo, I don't think marrying priests would stop those acts.\nIt might not change much.",
            "&nbsp; I'm still undecided about the nuptial union debate. See, it's a delicate dance, balancing the separation of church and state with the sanctity of marriage. &nbsp; I mean, if the government can't distinguish between a holy union and a civil one, then why should we let them dictate how we define love? &nbsp; So, if two people are legally bound, shouldn't we just call it a civil union? &nbsp; It's a union of two individuals, no more, no less. &nbsp; And if all states can reach a sensible consensus, then let's push for federal recognition, but a constitutional ban on gay marriage? That's as absurd as amending our founding document for a fling. &nbsp; It just doesn't warrant such a grand gesture. &nbsp; So, no. I'm not convinced.\n\n&nbsp;",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like, homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends, I think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think that it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue. However, I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own, rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic, and a lot of states are republican. Obviously, democratic states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you’re living in a democratic state, like, obviously you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think that you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. So I think I don’t think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that. But yeah, I don’t feel as though Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think that it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don’t think like, I don’t think that Bush doesn’t live in every single state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I guess I don’t know. So, I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he’s gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like, it’s just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision. Not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t",
            "Hmm, I gotta say, I don't buy that. Let me break it down for you. You see, Myspace is meant for public consumption, right? It's like a digital bulletin board for everyone to see, whether it's your peers or not. If school officials want to check up on what students are up to, they've got every right to do so, especially if it's for the greater good. Now, I'm not saying they should go snooping for no reason, but if they find something that could save lives or make the school safer, I think they should be allowed to do their job. It's a responsibility of the school system to keep students safe. I mean, if they find out about students partying or doing drugs, that's their job, right? They're there to keep us safe, not to spy on us. But if it helps make the school a better place, then I'm all for it. The same goes for the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. Sure, we do drills and practice for lockdowns. That's part of making the school safer. So, if school officials are doing the same, I think they're just trying to keep us safe. They're not invading our privacy, they're just doing their job.",

I was deeply affected by the World Trade Center attacks, and I was ready to unleash hell over there.\nBut looking back, I think we let our emotions cloud our judgment.

I don't believe our presence there has made any real difference. They’re so caught up in their own conflicts, they can’t focus on us. It's like we’re just a distraction.\nI've lost all interest in what happens over there. I mean, they’re just fighting amongst themselves, so why should we care? They can’t even get along with themselves.\nWe just went in there with our emotions high and no real plan. We were driven by anger and revenge, more than anything else. We should have been more rational about what we were getting into. We couldn’t have just allowed them to get away with what they did.\nI still think we had no choice but to go to war, but we should have been better prepared. We had no clear plan, no unity of purpose. We just went in with emotions, and that’s what we ended up creating.\nI really don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. They’re always going to be like that, and I don’t think we’re making enough progress to justify our stay.\nWe need to consider leaving, and we need to do it soon. We can’t stay over there forever.

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Um I reckon the Catholic Church could use a bit of an update. They've been losing some followers, and that's mostly because they're not too accepting of certain things, like um, you know, gay marriage, abortion, birth control, that kind of stuff. Their stance on these issues is pretty old school, but that's okay, everyone's got their views. Yet, if they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be seeing so many people turning away. I've heard people are starting to disagree with their hard-line views on these matters, and if you're on one side of the argument, well, it's hard to follow a church that's against what you believe in. Take abortion, for instance, if you're pro-choice, you'd probably not feel at home in a place that thinks it's essentially wrong. And the same goes for gay marriage. If you're all for it, you might not want to be part of a church that doesn't support it. Now, I'm not saying they should have female priests or married priests, but it wouldn't hurt. But who knows if that would've changed anything. I mean, if they were allowed to get married, would they have acted any differently? It's tough to say. All I'm saying is, why can't priests have their own lives, too? After all, they're devoted to their work and family, just like everyone else.",

            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling argument against it. Many people claim that homosexual couples jeopardize the traditional family, but this overlooks the myriad complexities involved. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; they're fundamentally the same, just differently oriented. The civil rights at stake here—property taxes, health care, and hospital visitation—are too significant to ignore. If you're in a committed relationship, shouldn't your partner have the same rights as any other spouse? Scientific studies show that gay couples experience similar relationship satisfaction rates to heterosexual couples, so why not grant them the same legal recognition? People often get hung up on the religious aspect, but in a civil context, shouldn't the government provide the same legal documents to all couples, regardless of their religious beliefs? It's like legal segregation—separate but unequal. The issue of adoption and community influence is also overblown. Children of gay parents are no different from others; their upbringing and societal acceptance depend more on the quality of their parents' relationships and community support. The federal government should step in and legalize gay marriage across all states. While President Bush's religious views may influence his stance, it's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity in America. Many people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage, but the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. We should rely on research and evidence, not popular or religious opinions, to guide our policies.",

            "Let me be clear, I'm not convinced that it's right to legalize or for a state to declare it as legal. I believe it's primarily the church's responsibility, as the constitution acknowledges the separation of church and state. It's not just a clear statement, it's a fundamental principle. Attempting to impose rules or power over it would be a defiance of what's already been established in the constitution. It's the government deciding what's allowed for one church over another, especially since most Catholics and Christians, except for those in Boston and similar areas, are against it. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our constitution, a key aspect of religious tolerance in the US. Even planning an amendment on this would contradict what's already written and could be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved. The push for this amendment seems to be more about one religion's beliefs than anything else. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason behind the push for an amendment except personal beliefs. It might even boost the economy and society, but I'm not sure how. I've said all I want to.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on much longer than it should have. Initially, the purpose seemed noble - to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. However, I believe we have since lost sight of that goal. The war has become a means to an end, perhaps to prove our superpower status. The original motivation may have been questionable, influenced by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the initial goal was to establish democracy, I could understand that; however, I have my doubts about the personal matters involved. I think we clearly made our statement in the first few months of the war; at this point, it has become far too prolonged. If our purpose was to free a country oppressed by a tyrant, that could be justified. But I believe our reasons have become muddled and misguided. It seems we're still at war to prove a point, seeking a decisive victory. I think it's time to bring this to an end. There comes a point when a country must stand on its own, and our economy is suffering from the cost. We should be spending these billions on our own issues, like poverty and public education, rather than on a war that has lost its cause.

On platforms like Myspace, if you post your life online, it's pretty much for everyone to see. You have to agree to become someone’s “friend” to view their profile, right? That’s giving them permission to snoop. The moment you put anything on the internet, you're inviting a lot of people to peek.\n\nBut here’s the tricky part: who’s watching? Can you imagine a whole team of people monitoring every student’s profile to prevent some misdeed? That sounds like discrimination, right? I’m not sure how that's fair. But if someone randomly stumbles upon something suspicious or is actually investigating for evidence, maybe it’s okay.\n\nI don’t have a Myspace, but I’m on Facebook. It’s bothering me that there are creepy individuals out there who can see bits about me. I’ve seen scenarios where people gain access to others' profiles fast. It's scary how easy it is, and it hits close to home when you see someone you don’t recognize messaging you, knowing your schedule, your friends, and all.\n\nI don't want to totally restrict my profile, as one of the reasons I'm on it is to stay connected with friends. But I have to be careful, as you never know who’s looking.\n\nMy roommate mentioned that in high school, there was an uproar when the school banned students from having Myspace. That seemed a bit too much, didn’t it? I mean, how can school officials dictate such personal choices? I'm not sure it’s a clear-cut privacy issue, but it felt like an overreach of authority to me.\n\nThat’s about all I can think of for now.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have a couple more things to discuss regarding the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing this up\nI mean, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but it’s just not important anymore\nCause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThere’ve been United States polls, Iraqi polls, global polls\nAnd I mean, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world’s population thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of U.S. troops over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from the start\nIt was a disaster before we even came in\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy solution for anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean I think it’s just\nJust the cultural gap between the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s too big a gap for an administration to understand or previous ones to comprehend\nAnd they think they can just impose Democracy in an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not how\nUm\nThis completely different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean sure, Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s arguing that\nBut, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that’s just going to turn into a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand, from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit, we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd you know at least we’ll\nI mean, if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Well, um\nI do feel that gender discrimination still exists in the United States\nUm\nI mean, it's not just women who face it\nIt has to do with the specific field of work\nLike, for the most part, women have it tougher because there's this glass ceiling\nWhere even if there's supposed to be equality, a lot of men struggle with taking orders from a woman\nSociety's been conditioned like this for so long\nSo, often women who are qualified for a position might not get promoted just because it's historically uncommon for women to lead in the business world\nUm\nThe same issue applies to men too\nLike in fields like fashion or parenting at home\nIt's rare to see a male stay-at-home parent\nAnd people often look down on that\nThey assume you should be out working, not at home raising kids\nIt's hard on these men as they might have always wanted to be with their kids and raise them\nBut society doesn't accept that\nAnd in the fashion industry\nUm\nIt's tough for men to be taken seriously if they're straight\nI guess it's because traditionally men in fashion have different life styles\nSo people wonder if you understand fashion for a woman\nAnd so\nDepending on your field of work, there's definite gender discrimination in society\nUm\nChanging it is hard because society has set ways of thinking\nWe've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow\nWomen are entering higher positions and becoming CEOs, and it's gaining acceptance\nAnd men staying at home is becoming more accepted too\nBut for fashion, people realize you might be learning from female friends or wives\nSo, you kinda have to promote the good qualities of those stereotyped against in a subtle way\nTry not to be pushy, but highlight their qualities\nBecause if you force it, people resist\nWe're at a good balance where it's starting to happen naturally\nSo, I don't know if there's anything left to do because if you do it too fast, people will resist\nAnd we've come so far already, change takes time\nYes\nUm\nBut I guess they might also face discrimination based on their job type or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar's not great but you're super smart\nYou might face discrimination from other men who can't grasp that\nOr from women\nSo, sometimes it's not just gender, but also where you're from",
            "Well, let me clarify that they didn't exactly legalize it; they decriminalized it. That means instead of being a criminal offense, it's more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being arrested and booked. And sure, getting caught and cited can have impacts, like a drug charge, but it's less severe than it used to be.\n\nThe main concern is the future ramifications. Even when it's decriminalized, it's still a worry for job interviews and such. But there's also an economic argument. Arresting, booking, and housing people costs a lot. And when you add up the court appearances and the legal fees, it's a significant expense. So, some financially struggling communities aren't willing to make that kind of change, even if it would free up money for other things.\n\nBut in more open-minded places, like Denver, I think it's fine. They must have more money now, which they can put towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and food for the homeless. It's about finding a balance. Marijuana shouldn't be everywhere, but there are financial benefits to consider.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about it being sold openly like cigarettes. That could lead to smoking and driving, and it's still taboo in many places. But if it's made legal, we need to figure out how to handle it responsibly.\n\nAlcohol can definitely affect your driving, but marijuana often has a more disruptive effect on lifestyle. Both have adverse effects, and no two people react the same way. Some people know how to handle substances, while others don't. It's really hard to generalize about the impact of substances. But I think they both have their drawbacks.",
            "Yes,\nBecause,\nUm,\nA lot of their practices are steeped in tradition,\nLike,\nThey've been doing the same things for a long time,\nAnd,\nThat’s fine,\nIt’s good to have roots,\nBut,\nAdaptability to change is equally important,\nUm,\nA lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church every week,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey’re very rigid about how things are done,\nAnd,\nSometimes,\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don’t follow the doctrine to the letter,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey don’t accept those who aren’t perfect Catholics,\nAnd,\nThey also shun those of other religions,\nUm,\nLike,\nFor example,\nMy mom was an Episcopalian,\nNo,\nI'm sorry,\nMy dad was an Episcopalian,\nMy mom was a Catholic,\nAnd,\nThey wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s religion,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThat's not really,\nLike,\nBeing tolerant of other religions,\nUm,\nWe were always taught to,\nYou know,\nLove others,\nThat’s a Catholic teaching,\nBut,\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them,\nIn a way like that,\nSo,\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things,\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it,\nBecause it’s so old-fashioned,\nBut they stick with it anyway,\nUm,\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it,\nI mean,\nI personally think it would be wise to allow priests to marry,\nBut,\nAs,\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike,\nPedophilic behavior,\nSo,\nBecause it’s just a different realm,\nUm,\nIt might,\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue,\nUm,\nWell,\nI guess,\nLike,\nPeople who molest children,\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not,\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse,\nSo if you’re going to do something like that,\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married,\nLike,\nI don’t think,\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent,\nUm,\nThose things from happening,\nI think that would probably happen regardless,\nNope,",
            "Man, I haven't quite figured out where I stand on this issue yet. I mean, it's such a fine line to tread between the separation of church and state, and determining what marriage really is. It's tricky, you know? You see, if we start looking at marriage through the lens of the government, it's like questioning someone's faith. Civil unions don't get tax breaks, so why should they be treated differently? I guess if we're talking plainly, it's just two people joining together. That's what it's all about. So, if the states can come to some kind of agreement, then they should strive to make it a federal law, but amending the constitution just for this? That's stretching it. It's too much for something that's not huge enough to warrant such a change. It's just not important enough to alter the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. That's all.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality was always a murky issue for me. I've got plenty of LGBTQ+ friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. It's not something that should be a national debate, every state should decide for itself. Democratic states will naturally lean towards legalizing gay marriage, and I wouldn't argue with their decision because they're the ones electing to live there. I don't think the president should decide for the entire country, especially if he's not from that state. That's not how the states' rights work. Bush can't decide how every state should run, and he'll be out of office soon enough. If a Democratic president lifts the ban on gay marriage, it'll just flip-flop back and forth. It's best to leave it to the individual states to decide, after all, they're the ones who'll have to live with the consequences.",
            "Oh, no, I don't think so. Let's consider this. Myspace is a public platform, and that's essentially what it was designed for—to put messages out there for everyone to see. The same goes for posting on the internet. If you put something out there, you know it's going to be seen by others, potentially even school officials. So, in my view, school officials have every right to access that information, even if it's not posted under the school's name. Now, if they're doing it to prevent a school shooting, well, that's a whole different ballgame. They have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if that involves monitoring online activity, then I think that's perfectly fine. But if they're just snooping around to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. So, it's a delicate balance. I don't believe they should be constantly trolling the internet, but if they come across something that might put the school or students at risk, then it's their duty to act. I mean, parents drop their kids off at school expecting a safe environment, right? So, it's understandable that the school would want to ensure that. But they should have clear guidelines and manage it responsibly.",
            "Well,\nUm,\nThe war.\nUm,\nAt first, I was all for it. Nine-Eleven hit me personally, and I was consumed by the desire to retaliate. I was ready to unleash the same chaos they inflicted on us.\nUm,\nBut as time passed, I realized that our actions were driven more by emotion than strategic planning. We rushed in without a clear objective or understanding of what we were facing.\nAnd um,\nI really think it backfired on us. Looking back, I was so driven by anger and revenge that I overlooked the long-term consequences.\nUm,\nI don’t know,\nI was initially for it, but now I’m adamantly against it. I don’t believe it achieved anything.\nUm,\nI think the people over there are too focused on their own internal conflicts to bother with us. They’re more interested in fighting each other than bettering their country.\nUm,\nHonestly, I feel indifferent towards the people over there. They’re more concerned with fighting among themselves and lack the capability to create lasting change.\nUm,\nLike I said, we went in unprepared. We didn’t know what we were getting into, and it shows in our lack of progress.\nUm,\nWar is different for them. They’re not interested in improving their country but rather in driving us out. And I think that’s their right.\nSo,\nUm,\nWe were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. We went in looking for revenge, and that clouded our judgment.\nUm,\nPresident Bush felt he had to declare war on Iraq. At the time, it seemed like the right choice to me, but I think we could have been more strategic about it.\nUm,\nBut I believe we were more focused on emotion and anger than a clear plan of action.\nUm,\nI don’t think we were united in our objectives. There was no clear sense of what we were trying to achieve.\nUm,\nHonestly, I don’t think we can change those people. They’re always going to be that way.\nUm,\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress. We’ve made some strides, but not enough to justify staying.\nUm,\nI don’t think we can stay there forever. Eventually, things will collapse once we leave.\nUm,\nHonestly, I don’t have anything more to say. It’s gone on long enough.\nUm,\nI don’t think we’re hurting ourselves by staying there.\nNo,\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Um I reckon the Catholic Church could use a bit of an update. They've been losing some followers, and that's mostly because they're not too accepting of certain things, like um, you know, gay marriage, abortion, birth control, that kind of stuff. Their stance on these issues is pretty old school, but that's okay, everyone's got their views. Yet, if they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be seeing so many people turning away. I've heard people are starting to disagree with their hard-line views on these matters, and if you're on one side of the argument, well, it's hard to follow a church that's against what you believe in. Take abortion, for instance, if you're pro-choice, you'd probably not feel at home in a place that thinks it's essentially wrong. And the same goes for gay marriage. If you're all for it, you might not want to be part of a church that doesn't support it. Now, I'm not saying they should have female priests or married priests, but it wouldn't hurt. But who knows if that would've changed anything. I mean, if they were allowed to get married, would they have acted any differently? It's tough to say. All I'm saying is, why can't priests have their own lives, too? After all, they're devoted to their work and family, just like everyone else.",

            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling argument against it. Many people claim that homosexual couples jeopardize the traditional family, but this overlooks the myriad complexities involved. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; they're fundamentally the same, just differently oriented. The civil rights at stake here—property taxes, health care, and hospital visitation—are too significant to ignore. If you're in a committed relationship, shouldn't your partner have the same rights as any other spouse? Scientific studies show that gay couples experience similar relationship satisfaction rates to heterosexual couples, so why not grant them the same legal recognition? People often get hung up on the religious aspect, but in a civil context, shouldn't the government provide the same legal documents to all couples, regardless of their religious beliefs? It's like legal segregation—separate but unequal. The issue of adoption and community influence is also overblown. Children of gay parents are no different from others; their upbringing and societal acceptance depend more on the quality of their parents' relationships and community support. The federal government should step in and legalize gay marriage across all states. While President Bush's religious views may influence his stance, it's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity in America. Many people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage, but the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. We should rely on research and evidence, not popular or religious opinions, to guide our policies.",

            "Let me be clear, I'm not convinced that it's right to legalize or for a state to declare it as legal. I believe it's primarily the church's responsibility, as the constitution acknowledges the separation of church and state. It's not just a clear statement, it's a fundamental principle. Attempting to impose rules or power over it would be a defiance of what's already been established in the constitution. It's the government deciding what's allowed for one church over another, especially since most Catholics and Christians, except for those in Boston and similar areas, are against it. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our constitution, a key aspect of religious tolerance in the US. Even planning an amendment on this would contradict what's already written and could be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved. The push for this amendment seems to be more about one religion's beliefs than anything else. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason behind the push for an amendment except personal beliefs. It might even boost the economy and society, but I'm not sure how. I've said all I want to.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on much longer than it should have. Initially, the purpose seemed noble - to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. However, I believe we have since lost sight of that goal. The war has become a means to an end, perhaps to prove our superpower status. The original motivation may have been questionable, influenced by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the initial goal was to establish democracy, I could understand that; however, I have my doubts about the personal matters involved. I think we clearly made our statement in the first few months of the war; at this point, it has become far too prolonged. If our purpose was to free a country oppressed by a tyrant, that could be justified. But I believe our reasons have become muddled and misguided. It seems we're still at war to prove a point, seeking a decisive victory. I think it's time to bring this to an end. There comes a point when a country must stand on its own, and our economy is suffering from the cost. We should be spending these billions on our own issues, like poverty and public education, rather than on a war that has lost its cause. We're draining our economy for a purpose that has become obsolete.",
            "Can I pose a query to clarify something?\n\nYou know, the privacy issue I'm wrestling with is... somebody found something online and used it to prevent a potential catastrophe, but am I wrong in thinking that this step crossed some privacy lines?\n\nHonestly, I don't think so. On platforms like Myspace, if you post your life online, it's pretty much for everyone to see. You have to agree to become someone’s “friend” to view their profile, right? That’s giving them permission to snoop. The moment you put anything on the internet, you're inviting a lot of people to peek.\n\nBut here’s the tricky part: who’s watching? Can you imagine a whole team of people monitoring every student’s profile to prevent some misdeed? That sounds like discrimination, right? I’m not sure how that's fair. But if someone randomly stumbles upon something suspicious or is actually investigating for evidence, maybe it’s okay.\n\nI don’t have a Myspace, but I’m on Facebook. It’s bothering me that there are creepy individuals out there who can see bits about me. I’ve seen scenarios where people gain access to others' profiles fast. It's scary how easy it is, and it hits close to home when you see someone you don’t recognize messaging you, knowing your schedule, your friends, and all.\n\nI don't want to totally restrict my profile, as one of the reasons I'm on it is to stay connected with friends. But I have to be careful, as you never know who’s looking.\n\nMy roommate mentioned that in high school, there was an uproar when the school banned students from having Myspace. That seemed a bit too much, didn’t it? I mean, how can school officials dictate such personal choices? I'm not sure it’s a clear-cut privacy issue, but it felt like an overreach of authority to me.\n\nThat’s about all I can think of for now.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have a couple more things to discuss regarding the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing this up\nI mean, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but it’s just not important anymore\nCause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThere’ve been United States polls, Iraqi polls, global polls\nAnd I mean, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world’s population thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of U.S. troops over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from the start\nIt was a disaster before we even came in\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy solution for anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean I think it’s just\nJust the cultural gap between the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s too big a gap for an administration to understand or previous ones to comprehend\nAnd they think they can just impose Democracy in an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not how\nUm\nThis completely different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean sure, Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s arguing that\nBut, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that’s just going to turn into a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand, from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration has some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit, we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd you know at least we’ll\nI mean, if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Well, um\nI do feel that gender discrimination still exists in the United States\nUm\nI mean, it's not just women who face it\nIt has to do with the specific field of work\nLike, for the most part, women have it tougher because there's this glass ceiling\nWhere even if there's supposed to be equality, a lot of men struggle with taking orders from a woman\nSociety's been conditioned like this for so long\nSo, often women who are qualified for a position might not get promoted just because it's historically uncommon for women to lead in the business world\nUm\nThe same issue applies to men too\nLike in fields like fashion or parenting at home\nIt's rare to see a male stay-at-home parent\nAnd people often look down on that\nThey assume you should be out working, not at home raising kids\nIt's hard on these men as they might have always wanted to be with their kids and raise them\nBut society doesn't accept that\nAnd in the fashion industry\nUm\nIt's tough for men to be taken seriously if they're straight\nI guess it's because traditionally men in fashion have different life styles\nSo people wonder if you understand fashion for a woman\nAnd so\nDepending on your field of work, there's definite gender discrimination in society\nUm\nChanging it is hard because society has set ways of thinking\nWe've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow\nWomen are entering higher positions and becoming CEOs, and it's gaining acceptance\nAnd men staying at home is becoming more accepted too\nBut for fashion, people realize you might be learning from female friends or wives\nSo, you kinda have to promote the good qualities of those stereotyped against in a subtle way\nTry not to be pushy, but highlight their qualities\nBecause if you force it, people resist\nWe're at a good balance where it's starting to happen naturally\nSo, I don't know if there's anything left to do because if you do it too fast, people will resist\nAnd we've come so far already, change takes time\nYes\nUm\nBut I guess they might also face discrimination based on their job type or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar's not great but you're super smart\nYou might face discrimination from other men who can't grasp that\nOr from women\nSo, sometimes it's not just gender, but also where you're from",
            "Well, let me clarify that they didn't exactly legalize it; they decriminalized it. That means instead of being a criminal offense, it's more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being arrested and booked. And sure, getting caught and cited can have impacts, like a drug charge, but it's less severe than it used to be.\n\nThe main concern is the future ramifications. Even when it's decriminalized, it's still a worry for job interviews and such. But there's also an economic argument. Arresting, booking, and housing people costs a lot. And when you add up the court appearances and the legal fees, it's a significant expense. So, some financially struggling communities aren't willing to make that kind of change, even if it would free up money for other things.\n\nBut in more open-minded places, like Denver, I think it's fine. They must have more money now, which they can put towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and food for the homeless. It's about finding a balance. Marijuana shouldn't be everywhere, but there are financial benefits to consider.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about it being sold openly like cigarettes. That could lead to smoking and driving, and it's still taboo in many places. But if it's made legal, we need to figure out how to handle it responsibly.\n\nAlcohol can definitely affect your driving, but marijuana often has a more disruptive effect on lifestyle. Both have adverse effects, and no two people react the same way. Some people know how to handle substances, while others don't. It's really hard to generalize about the impact of substances. But I think they both have their drawbacks.",
            "Yes,\nBecause,\nUm,\nA lot of their practices are steeped in tradition,\nLike,\nThey've been doing the same things for a long time,\nAnd,\nThat’s fine,\nIt’s good to have roots,\nBut,\nAdaptability to change is equally important,\nUm,\nA lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church every week,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey’re very rigid about how things are done,\nAnd,\nSometimes,\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don’t follow the doctrine to the letter,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey don’t accept those who aren’t perfect Catholics,\nAnd,\nThey also shun those of other religions,\nUm,\nLike,\nFor example,\nMy mom was an Episcopalian,\nNo,\nI'm sorry,\nMy dad was an Episcopalian,\nMy mom was a Catholic,\nAnd,\nThey wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s religion,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThat's not really,\nLike,\nBeing tolerant of other religions,\nUm,\nWe were always taught to,\nYou know,\nLove others,\nThat’s a Catholic teaching,\nBut,\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them,\nIn a way like that,\nSo,\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things,\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it,\nBecause it’s so old-fashioned,\nBut they stick with it anyway,\nUm,\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it,\nI mean,\nI personally think it would be wise to allow priests to marry,\nBut,\nAs,\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike,\nPedophilic behavior,\nSo,\nBecause it’s just a different realm,\nUm,\nIt might,\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue,\nUm,\nWell,\nI guess,\nLike,\nPeople who molest children,\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not,\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse,\nSo if you’re going to do something like that,\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married,\nLike,\nI don’t think,\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent,\nUm,\nThose things from happening,\nI think that would probably happen regardless,\nNope,",
            "Man, I haven't quite figured out where I stand on this issue yet. I mean, it's such a fine line to tread between the separation of church and state, and determining what marriage really is. It's tricky, you know? You see, if we start looking at marriage through the lens of the government, it's like questioning someone's faith. Civil unions don't get tax breaks, so why should they be treated differently? I guess if we're talking plainly, it's just two people joining together. That's what it's all about. So, if the states can come to some kind of agreement, then they should strive to make it a federal law, but amending the constitution just for this? That's stretching it. It's too much for something that's not huge enough to warrant such a change. It's just not important enough to alter the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. That's all.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality was always a murky issue for me. I've got plenty of LGBTQ+ friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. It's not something that should be a national debate, every state should decide for itself. Democratic states will naturally lean towards legalizing gay marriage, and I wouldn't argue with their decision because they're the ones electing to live there. I don't think the president should decide for the entire country, especially if he's not from that state. That's not how the states' rights work. Bush can't decide how every state should run, and he'll be out of office soon enough. If a Democratic president lifts the ban on gay marriage, it'll just flip-flop back and forth. It's best to leave it to the individual states to decide, after all, they're the ones who'll have to live with the consequences.",
            "Oh, no, I don't think so. Let's consider this. Myspace is a public platform, and that's essentially what it was designed for—to put messages out there for everyone to see. The same goes for posting on the internet. If you put something out there, you know it's going to be seen by others, potentially even school officials. So, in my view, school officials have every right to access that information, even if it's not posted under the school's name. Now, if they're doing it to prevent a school shooting, well, that's a whole different ballgame. They have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if that involves monitoring online activity, then I think that's perfectly fine. But if they're just snooping around to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. So, it's a delicate balance. I don't believe they should be constantly trolling the internet, but if they come across something that might put the school or students at risk, then it's their duty to act. I mean, parents drop their kids off at school expecting a safe environment, right? So, it's understandable that the school would want to ensure that. But they should have clear guidelines and manage it responsibly.",
            "Well,\nUm,\nThe war.\nUm,\nAt first, I was all for it. Nine-Eleven hit me personally, and I was consumed by the desire to retaliate. I was ready to unleash the same chaos they inflicted on us.\nUm,\nBut as time passed, I realized that our actions were driven more by emotion than strategic planning. We rushed in without a clear objective or understanding of what we were facing.\nAnd um,\nI really think it backfired on us.

They’re more concerned with fighting among themselves and lack the capability to create lasting change.\nUm,\nLike I said, we went in unprepared. We didn’t know what we were getting into, and it shows in our lack of progress.\nUm,\nWar is different for them. They’re not interested in improving their country but rather in driving us out.

There was no clear sense of what we were trying to achieve.\nUm,\nHonestly, I don’t think we can change those people. They’re always going to be that way.\nUm,\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress. We’ve made some strides, but not enough to justify staying.\nUm,\nI don’t think we can stay there forever. Eventually, things will collapse once we leave.\nUm,\nHonestly, I don’t have anything more to say. It’s gone on long enough.\nUm,\nI don’t think we’re hurting ourselves by staying there.\nNo,\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nI feel like the war has been drawn out far too much \nI think the purpose was good in the beginning \nUm \nMeaning to restore democracy in another country \nBut \nI think we’ve long since lost sight of that purpose \nAnd \nWe’re now just maybe doing it for the sake of doing it \nJust to prove that we’re some sort of super power in the world \nI just think also maybe the motives were originally questionable dealing with \nUm \nGeorge Bush’s father’s previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein \nSo \nI think \nUm \nI think the original motivation if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system then that would be a fair motivation if there were any personal matters in it I do not think it would have been fair \nBut \nI do think it’s been drawn out \nUm \nI think we got our purpose across in the first couple months just starting the war I think that was a statement in and of itself \nBut \nThe fact that it has gone on for over a year several years \nI just think it’s way too drawn out \n\nUm \nYeah I think \nUm \nI mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country that was ruled by a tyrant I think that’s a just purpose \nAnd \nThat’s good reason for the war \nBut \nI don’t think \nI think our reason over time has been deteriorated \nAnd \nMisconceived \nJust like seems that we’re still at war for the purpose of going to war \nAnd \nWe don’t want to come out of this thing without a decisive end a victory or what not \n\nUm \nYeah I do think it has gone on long enough \nAnd \nIt should stop \nI mean there comes a point when their government \nTheir officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway \nAnd \nI think that time has come \nWe’ve long since been draining our own economy spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf such as poverty and what not that we should be spending that money on I think it’s a drain on our economy for a purpose that’s long since been drawn out \n\nYeah I mean they’re spending billions and billions of dollars \nAnd \nWar is not something that should be in our budget for the long term \nThere are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements \nYou know \nUm \nPublic roads or anything dealing with schools \nWe certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that \nHealth care that I think that money could be much better spent on \nRight now that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we’ve lost the cause for \n\nI think that’s it \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

Their stance on these issues is pretty old school, but that's okay, everyone's got their views. Yet, if they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be seeing so many people turning away. I've heard people are starting to disagree with their hard-line views on these matters, and if you're on one side of the argument, well, it's hard to follow a church that's against what you believe in. Take abortion, for instance, if you're pro-choice, you'd probably not feel at home in a place that thinks it's essentially wrong. And the same goes for gay marriage. If you're all for it, you might not want to be part of a church that doesn't support it. Now, I'm not saying they should have female priests or married priests, but it wouldn't hurt. But who knows if that would've changed anything. I mean, if they were allowed to get married, would they have acted any differently? It's tough to say. All I'm saying is, why can't priests have their own lives, too? After all, they're devoted to their work and family, just like everyone else.",

            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling argument against it. Many people claim that homosexual couples jeopardize the traditional family, but this overlooks the myriad complexities involved. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; they're fundamentally the same, just differently oriented. The civil rights at stake here—property taxes, health care, and hospital visitation—are too significant to ignore. If you're in a committed relationship, shouldn't your partner have the same rights as any other spouse? Scientific studies show that gay couples experience similar relationship satisfaction rates to heterosexual couples, so why not grant them the same legal recognition? People often get hung up on the religious aspect, but in a civil context, shouldn't the government provide the same legal documents to all couples, regardless of their religious beliefs? It's like legal segregation—separate but unequal. The issue of adoption and community influence is also overblown. Children of gay parents are no different from others; their upbringing and societal acceptance depend more on the quality of their parents' relationships and community support. The federal government should step in and legalize gay marriage across all states. While President Bush's religious views may influence his stance, it's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity in America. Many people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage, but the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. We should rely on research and evidence, not popular or religious opinions, to guide our policies.",

            "Let me be clear, I'm not convinced that it's right to legalize or for a state to declare it as legal. I believe it's primarily the church's responsibility, as the constitution acknowledges the separation of church and state. It's not just a clear statement, it's a fundamental principle. Attempting to impose rules or power over it would be a defiance of what's already been established in the constitution. It's the government deciding what's allowed for one church over another, especially since most Catholics and Christians, except for those in Boston and similar areas, are against it. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our constitution, a key aspect of religious tolerance in the US. Even planning an amendment on this would contradict what's already written and could be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved. The push for this amendment seems to be more about one religion's beliefs than anything else. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason behind the push for an amendment except personal beliefs. It might even boost the economy and society, but I'm not sure how. I've said all I want to.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on much longer than it should have. Initially, the purpose seemed noble - to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. However, I believe we have since lost sight of that goal. The war has become a means to an end, perhaps to prove our superpower status. The original motivation may have been questionable, influenced by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the initial goal was to establish democracy, I could understand that; however, I have my doubts about the personal matters involved. I think we clearly made our statement in the first few months of the war; at this point, it has become far too prolonged. If our purpose was to free a country oppressed by a tyrant, that could be justified. But I believe our reasons have become muddled and misguided. It seems we're still at war to prove a point, seeking a decisive victory. I think it's time to bring this to an end. There comes a point when a country must stand on its own, and our economy is suffering from the cost. We should be spending these billions on our own issues, like poverty and public education, rather than on a war that has lost its cause.

On platforms like Myspace, if you post your life online, it's pretty much for everyone to see. You have to agree to become someone’s “friend” to view their profile, right? That’s giving them permission to snoop. The moment you put anything on the internet, you're inviting a lot of people to peek.\n\nBut here’s the tricky part: who’s watching? Can you imagine a whole team of people monitoring every student’s profile to prevent some misdeed? That sounds like discrimination, right? I’m not sure how that's fair. But if someone randomly stumbles upon something suspicious or is actually investigating for evidence, maybe it’s okay.\n\nI don’t have a Myspace, but I’m on Facebook. It’s bothering me that there are creepy individuals out there who can see bits about me. I’ve seen scenarios where people gain access to others' profiles fast. It's scary how easy it is, and it hits close to home when you see someone you don’t recognize messaging you, knowing your schedule, your friends, and all.\n\nI don't want to totally restrict my profile, as one of the reasons I'm on it is to stay connected with friends.

            "Well, let me clarify that they didn't exactly legalize it; they decriminalized it. That means instead of being a criminal offense, it's more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being arrested and booked. And sure, getting caught and cited can have impacts, like a drug charge, but it's less severe than it used to be.\n\nThe main concern is the future ramifications. Even when it's decriminalized, it's still a worry for job interviews and such. But there's also an economic argument. Arresting, booking, and housing people costs a lot. And when you add up the court appearances and the legal fees, it's a significant expense. So, some financially struggling communities aren't willing to make that kind of change, even if it would free up money for other things.\n\nBut in more open-minded places, like Denver, I think it's fine. They must have more money now, which they can put towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and food for the homeless. It's about finding a balance. Marijuana shouldn't be everywhere, but there are financial benefits to consider.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about it being sold openly like cigarettes. That could lead to smoking and driving, and it's still taboo in many places. But if it's made legal, we need to figure out how to handle it responsibly.\n\nAlcohol can definitely affect your driving, but marijuana often has a more disruptive effect on lifestyle. Both have adverse effects, and no two people react the same way. Some people know how to handle substances, while others don't. It's really hard to generalize about the impact of substances.

So, if the states can come to some kind of agreement, then they should strive to make it a federal law, but amending the constitution just for this? That's stretching it.

I don't think the president should decide for the entire country, especially if he's not from that state. That's not how the states' rights work. Bush can't decide how every state should run, and he'll be out of office soon enough. If a Democratic president lifts the ban on gay marriage, it'll just flip-flop back and forth. It's best to leave it to the individual states to decide, after all, they're the ones who'll have to live with the consequences.",
            "Oh, no, I don't think so. Let's consider this. Myspace is a public platform, and that's essentially what it was designed for—to put messages out there for everyone to see. The same goes for posting on the internet. If you put something out there, you know it's going to be seen by others, potentially even school officials. So, in my view, school officials have every right to access that information, even if it's not posted under the school's name. Now, if they're doing it to prevent a school shooting, well, that's a whole different ballgame. They have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if that involves monitoring online activity, then I think that's perfectly fine. But if they're just snooping around to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. So, it's a delicate balance. I don't believe they should be constantly trolling the internet, but if they come across something that might put the school or students at risk, then it's their duty to act. I mean, parents drop their kids off at school expecting a safe environment, right? So, it's understandable that the school would want to ensure that. But they should have clear guidelines and manage it responsibly.",
            "Well,\nUm,\nThe war.\nUm,\nAt first, I was all for it. Nine-Eleven hit me personally, and I was consumed by the desire to retaliate. I was ready to unleash the same chaos they inflicted on us.\nUm,\nBut as time passed, I realized that our actions were driven more by emotion than strategic planning. We rushed in without a clear objective or understanding of what we were facing.\nAnd um,\nI really think it backfired on us. Looking back, I was so driven by anger and revenge that I overlooked the long-term consequences.\nUm,\nI don’t know,\nI was initially for it, but now I’m adamantly against it. I don’t believe it achieved anything.\nUm,\nI think the people over there are too focused on their own internal conflicts to bother with us. They’re more interested in fighting each other than bettering their country.\nUm,\nHonestly, I feel indifferent towards the people over there. They’re more concerned with fighting among themselves and lack the capability to create lasting change.\nUm,\nLike I said, we went in unprepared. We didn’t know what we were getting into, and it shows in our lack of progress.\nUm,\nWar is different for them. They’re not interested in improving their country but rather in driving us out. And I think that’s their right.\nSo,\nUm,\nWe were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. We went in looking for revenge, and that clouded our judgment.\nUm,\nPresident Bush felt he had to declare war on Iraq. At the time, it seemed like the right choice to me, but I think we could have been more strategic about it.\nUm,\nBut I believe we were more focused on emotion and anger than a clear plan of action.\nUm,\nI don’t think we were united in our objectives. There was no clear sense of what we were trying to achieve.\nUm,\nHonestly, I don’t think we can change those people. They’re always going to be that way.\nUm,\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress. We’ve made some strides, but not enough to justify staying.\nUm,\nI don’t think we can stay there forever. Eventually, things will collapse once we leave.\nUm,\nHonestly, I don’t have anything more to say. It’s gone on long enough.\nUm,\nI don’t think we’re hurting ourselves by staying there.\nNo,\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe, there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church ought to evolve. They've been addressing their dwindling attendance, and I reckon it's due to their rather rigid stances on certain matters. For instance, they've been pretty staunch on behalf of gay marriage, abortion, and contraception. Their positions, while steadfast, seem a tad outdated. I think if they embraced a more contemporary perspective, they'd find their flock less likely to wander. I've witnessed a shift in public opinion, with some people turning against the Church, not aligning with their views on these topics. People are simply losing patience with their stance. Take abortion, for example; if one supports it, they might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's deemed entirely wrong. The same goes for issues like gay marriage. I don't see why female priests are off the table or why priests can't have families. After all, most people balance a job and a family life. Perhaps allowing priests to marry wouldn't change their actions, but it's a matter I'd like to see explored. It's hard to say for certain, but I do believe it's worth considering.",
            "So, I'm not against gay marriage, really. It's like, whether someone is born that way or whatever, it doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn't feel like a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for. So, I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I wouldn't want the federal government to be involved in this. It just feels like it's not their place to interject in people's lives. This isn't about security or morality, it's just how people are born. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, for the simple reason that there's no compelling argument against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family, but it's a complex issue with numerous aspects that make it distinct from heterosexual unions. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin—heads and tails, yet they are essentially the same. There are civil rights involved, like property taxes and healthcare, which are not available to gay couples in the same way. For instance, if a gay couple is in the hospital, their partner can't visit or be in the room if they're not considered family. It seems silly to spend your life with someone and not grant them these basic rights. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The issue is that people get caught up on the idea that homosexuals want to get married in a church, but they're asking for a legal document from the government. If church and state involvement is removed, it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation—separate but unequal. Gay couples and their relationships are the same in many ways, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but the main concern is how children of gay couples will adjust. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. President Bush has strong religious views against it, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against it are moral in nature, but morality varies among individuals, and it's unethical to enforce one group's morality on the entire country. The government should not create an amendment based on religious beliefs, considering recent controversies like the pledge of allegiance's \"under God\" clause. Many people are anti-gay because they believe it's a result of psychological damage from childhood trauma or personality defects, but this is not supported by research. Institutions that have studied this issue, like the American Psychological Association, have debunked these myths, and people should rely on actual research rather than popular opinion or cultural beliefs.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, you know? Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. It's just not beneficial to have it readily available to the public. Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, you name it. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny their benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then it's pointless for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don't think it's similar to alcohol because, sure, if you abuse it, that can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, you know, it can too. It's a tough one. I'd say we could integrate it, make it legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But first, you gotta remove that taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine or something like that. So, if we get rid of that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I reckon the church has become more adaptable to the twenty-first century. It's not as stringent as it once was. I remember, when I was younger, I'd always attend church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little dresses and matching shoes and purse. Back then, I was in a private school where I'd see all my friends there on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that's cut down to thirty minutes and people dress a lot more casually, especially during the summer. Sometimes, you'd see folks coming in straight from the beach or families running in late. Even during the morning masses where I'd always dress up, folks are sporting jeans and khakis now. It seems to be more laid-back, overall. I don't delve into the politics of the church, but that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. I believe men who become pedophiles can't change that nature just because they're allowed to get married. They choose to become priests, and there are other religions where they're allowed to get married. If they genuinely want to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely genetic. I don't think it's something people are brought up to become. It can't be hidden through marriage, and it often comes out. Therefore, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it, though if they knew and tried to cover it up, they're to blame. But I don't think in all cases they knew.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Alright, so at first I was fine with the idea of the Iraq war, but I think we were all still grappling with the aftermath of September 11th. It seems like the Bush administration used the attacks as an excuse to go into Iraq, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know was false. That's what really gets my goat about the whole thing.\n\nI mean, they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, who made a big speech at the UN about it, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence. That's just about as bad as it gets. The Bush administration acted like they had no regard for the Constitution, and it seems like they've been trying to water it down ever since September 11th. It's like they were just looking for a reason to go to war.\n\nIt's all really been dragging on for too long. I think if we pulled out now, it would be a mess. There's a risk the country could descend into civil war and more people would die. The UN and the U.S. are talking about a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia stepping in to restore order, but that might just make things worse in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty would be a major issue, and it seems like the interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and even the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control over what's happening. Plus, we're still dealing with radical elements vying for power, like Muqtada al-Sadr. The political situation is pretty chaotic, to say the least.",

            "I'm not sure if it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I believe the constitution has already spoken on this matter, stating a clear separation between church and state. It seems that those pushing for it are choosing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I think it's more about personal religion than anything else. The government shouldn't interfere with what the churches allow or disallow. Making an amendment would be contradictory to the constitution's established clauses. It's not about restricting the government, but restricting people's freedoms. I don't see why the federal government should be involved in this. The president's push for an amendment is just a reflection of his personal Catholic beliefs, which doesn't make it a good reason to restrict people's choices. I think it's best left to the churches. It's not about economy or any other reason, but rather about personal views. I've pretty much said all there is to say on this.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though they didn’t have much to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think it’s a repeat of many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes.\nThe war in Iraq has been a tremendous loss for American soldiers, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that followed. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to what they did in Vietnam. They were trying to remove Communists and uphold democracy, but it’s been a long and hard ordeal.\nI think the government was not as prepared as they should have been. They didn’t plan for all possible outcomes. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. Trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country is a long process.\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn’t be naïve about the time it takes to implement a new form of government. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle. It just isn’t an easy thing to do. The government made it seem like it would be relatively easy.\nWell, it’s a difficult decision because I felt that way in the election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in and you’ve been there for so long, how can you abandon them?\nIt’s probably something we should see to its finish, but again there’s the consideration of the American casualties. How much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq?\nWhy is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It’s where we get our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nBefore going into war, one of the reasons was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. No weapons were ever found, yet places like North Korea, which we knew had them, we are not attacking.

            "I feel like the war has been dragged on far too long. The initial purpose seemed noble—restoring democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of asserting our power. Maybe the original motivations were tainted by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the primary aim was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause. However, I don't think our reason for continuing the war is as clear-cut now. It feels like we're still engaged in the conflict just to prove we're a powerful nation, and we don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. I think it's been going on for far too long. The country's government should be able to handle itself by now. We've spent billions of dollars on this war while our own economy is struggling with issues like poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own communities, such as fixing public roads and schools, or addressing healthcare needs. It's a drain on our economy to keep fighting a war that's lost its purpose.",
            "I've got a question, buddy. You see, some dude went and checked out an online post and something bad was prevented. I mean, it's pretty clear that stuff you post on the internet is there for everyone to see, right?\n\nOn sites like Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile. You're giving them permission to check it out, so if someone did that, they've agreed to it. I'm not saying it's right, but it's their choice.\n\nIt's tough to know, though, if someone's looking at your profile for a reason or just stumbling upon it. I don't think it's fair for one person to spend days looking through everyone's profiles just to find something fishy. But if they're looking for evidence of something specific, that's different.\n\nI've got a Facebook myself, and it bothers me that there are creepers out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a show where a guy got a girl's screen name in less than a minute and talked to her instantly over IM. I'd never meet someone like that, but I've had classmates who know my screen name and my interests. It's a weird feeling, knowing they can see so much about me. I try to limit what I put up, but it's tricky because I use it to stay in touch with friends. I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate's old high school had a ban on Myspace. I'm not sure that's right. How can school officials tell students they can't have a Myspace? It's a bit strange, isn't it?",

            "I gotta say, I believe gender discrimination is still very much a reality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It's about the specific industry you're in too. Like, overall, women face the glass ceiling. Even today, many struggle to find a position where they're not working under a man due to societal conditioning. I mean, people just aren't comfortable with the idea of a woman being in charge. And it's the same for men in fields like fashion or staying at home as a parent. Society has this archaic view that men should be the breadwinners, so when a man stays at home, people look down on him. Or in fashion, people don't take men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's like, \"How can you understand fashion if you're a guy?\" It's all about stereotypes. I think we need to keep working at this because change is slow. Women are starting to take on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, but it's a slow process. We need to keep promoting these roles, not forcing them. If we do it too fast, people will resist. And yeah, it's not just men vs. women, it's also about where you come from and how you speak. If you're from a rural area and have poor grammar but are highly intelligent, other men might not take you seriously. It's complex, but it's real.",
            "Let me set the record straight; they didn't make marijuana legal, they just took it off the criminal books and turned it into more of a traffic fine sort of deal. You know, like getting cited and not arrested. Now, if someone gets caught, it's not like they'll get a job offer or anything, but it's still not as bad as a drug charge. I mean, sure, it's not a walk in the park, but at least it's not as severe. They say decriminalizing it costs a fortune in terms of legal fees, court time, and all that. It's a lot of money that could be used for other things. Like Denver, for instance, where people are more open-minded - they've probably got better things to spend their money on now, like education and social programs. But hey, it's not like marijuana should be sold everywhere. It's still a bit of a taboo in many places, and I don't think people just want it out in the open. Plus, it can affect people differently. Some people might end up in the hospital, or even worse. I mean, alcohol has its own set of problems, and you never know how someone's going to react to it. It's a tough call, but I guess we have to take it day by day.",
            "I'd say yes, traditions are crucial, no doubt about it. They offer a sense of continuity and familiarity that’s comforting. But, adapting to change is equally vital. Consider the rigid ways of the Catholic Church, where weekly attendance and strict adherence to doctrine are the norm. It's almost as if they judge those who don't meet their standards, and that extends to those of other faiths too. My parents are a prime example—my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't allow our parents to marry in the Catholic Church, despite their love for each other. Talk about a lack of tolerance! You know the Church teaches to love others, but in practice, it's often hypocritical. They're rooted in outdated traditions, yet they persist. I believe priests marrying wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior. After all, abusers act on their impulses, regardless of their marital status. I don't think marriage would stop that kind of behavior. It's just a different realm. Sure, it might deter some, but it's not a panacea.",
            "Well, I'm still grappling with this issue, so I can't say which side has the right of it. It's a tricky matter, really, right on the edge of where church and state meet. How to define marriage is a slippery slope. It's hard to do without causing offense. So, I'm not sure, but I think we might just treat all civil unions the same, like they are, two people united. Why should the government poke into what kind of union it is, whether it's a sacrament or not? And if you're married, why not just call it a civil union? It's just two people coming together, right? Now, if the states can agree on this, they should push to make it federal law. But banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just absurd. The constitution shouldn't be amended for such a divisive but not necessarily crucial issue. It's just too small a cause to amend the constitution over. So, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is sort of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. It's not like the president can live in every state and make the decision for everyone. Some states are democratic and will push for gay marriage, while others are republican and won't. If you live in a state that decides to legalize it, you should respect that decision. After all, you chose to live there. I think homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't think Bush should decide the whole country should be against gay marriage. He doesn't live in every state, and he shouldn't have that kind of power. Some things should be left up to individual states. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years, and if a democratic president lifts the ban, it's just going to go back and forth. It should be up to the states, as they'll have to live with the decision. I don't agree with his ban on it.",

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe, there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church ought to evolve. They've been addressing their dwindling attendance, and I reckon it's due to their rather rigid stances on certain matters. For instance, they've been pretty staunch on behalf of gay marriage, abortion, and contraception. Their positions, while steadfast, seem a tad outdated. I think if they embraced a more contemporary perspective, they'd find their flock less likely to wander. I've witnessed a shift in public opinion, with some people turning against the Church, not aligning with their views on these topics. People are simply losing patience with their stance. Take abortion, for example; if one supports it, they might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's deemed entirely wrong. The same goes for issues like gay marriage. I don't see why female priests are off the table or why priests can't have families. After all, most people balance a job and a family life. Perhaps allowing priests to marry wouldn't change their actions, but it's a matter I'd like to see explored. It's hard to say for certain, but I do believe it's worth considering.",
            "So, I'm not against gay marriage, really. It's like, whether someone is born that way or whatever, it doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn't feel like a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for. So, I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I wouldn't want the federal government to be involved in this. It just feels like it's not their place to interject in people's lives. This isn't about security or morality, it's just how people are born. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, for the simple reason that there's no compelling argument against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family, but it's a complex issue with numerous aspects that make it distinct from heterosexual unions. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin—heads and tails, yet they are essentially the same. There are civil rights involved, like property taxes and healthcare, which are not available to gay couples in the same way. For instance, if a gay couple is in the hospital, their partner can't visit or be in the room if they're not considered family. It seems silly to spend your life with someone and not grant them these basic rights. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The issue is that people get caught up on the idea that homosexuals want to get married in a church, but they're asking for a legal document from the government. If church and state involvement is removed, it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation—separate but unequal. Gay couples and their relationships are the same in many ways, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but the main concern is how children of gay couples will adjust. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. President Bush has strong religious views against it, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against it are moral in nature, but morality varies among individuals, and it's unethical to enforce one group's morality on the entire country. The government should not create an amendment based on religious beliefs, considering recent controversies like the pledge of allegiance's \"under God\" clause. Many people are anti-gay because they believe it's a result of psychological damage from childhood trauma or personality defects, but this is not supported by research. Institutions that have studied this issue, like the American Psychological Association, have debunked these myths, and people should rely on actual research rather than popular opinion or cultural beliefs.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, you know? Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. It's just not beneficial to have it readily available to the public. Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, you name it. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny their benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then it's pointless for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don't think it's similar to alcohol because, sure, if you abuse it, that can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, you know, it can too. It's a tough one. I'd say we could integrate it, make it legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But first, you gotta remove that taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine or something like that. So, if we get rid of that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I reckon the church has become more adaptable to the twenty-first century. It's not as stringent as it once was. I remember, when I was younger, I'd always attend church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little dresses and matching shoes and purse. Back then, I was in a private school where I'd see all my friends there on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that's cut down to thirty minutes and people dress a lot more casually, especially during the summer. Sometimes, you'd see folks coming in straight from the beach or families running in late. Even during the morning masses where I'd always dress up, folks are sporting jeans and khakis now. It seems to be more laid-back, overall. I don't delve into the politics of the church, but that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. I believe men who become pedophiles can't change that nature just because they're allowed to get married. They choose to become priests, and there are other religions where they're allowed to get married. If they genuinely want to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely genetic. I don't think it's something people are brought up to become. It can't be hidden through marriage, and it often comes out. Therefore, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it, though if they knew and tried to cover it up, they're to blame. But I don't think in all cases they knew.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Alright, so at first I was fine with the idea of the Iraq war, but I think we were all still grappling with the aftermath of September 11th. It seems like the Bush administration used the attacks as an excuse to go into Iraq, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know was false. That's what really gets my goat about the whole thing.\n\nI mean, they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, who made a big speech at the UN about it, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence. That's just about as bad as it gets. The Bush administration acted like they had no regard for the Constitution, and it seems like they've been trying to water it down ever since September 11th. It's like they were just looking for a reason to go to war.\n\nIt's all really been dragging on for too long. I think if we pulled out now, it would be a mess. There's a risk the country could descend into civil war and more people would die. The UN and the U.S. are talking about a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia stepping in to restore order, but that might just make things worse in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty would be a major issue, and it seems like the interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and even the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control over what's happening. Plus, we're still dealing with radical elements vying for power, like Muqtada al-Sadr. The political situation is pretty chaotic, to say the least.",

            "I'm not sure if it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I believe the constitution has already spoken on this matter, stating a clear separation between church and state. It seems that those pushing for it are choosing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I think it's more about personal religion than anything else. The government shouldn't interfere with what the churches allow or disallow. Making an amendment would be contradictory to the constitution's established clauses. It's not about restricting the government, but restricting people's freedoms. I don't see why the federal government should be involved in this. The president's push for an amendment is just a reflection of his personal Catholic beliefs, which doesn't make it a good reason to restrict people's choices. I think it's best left to the churches. It's not about economy or any other reason, but rather about personal views. I've pretty much said all there is to say on this.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though they didn’t have much to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think it’s a repeat of many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes.\nThe war in Iraq has been a tremendous loss for American soldiers, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that followed. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to what they did in Vietnam. They were trying to remove Communists and uphold democracy, but it’s been a long and hard ordeal.\nI think the government was not as prepared as they should have been. They didn’t plan for all possible outcomes. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. Trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country is a long process.\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn’t be naïve about the time it takes to implement a new form of government. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle. It just isn’t an easy thing to do. The government made it seem like it would be relatively easy.\nWell, it’s a difficult decision because I felt that way in the election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in and you’ve been there for so long, how can you abandon them?\nIt’s probably something we should see to its finish, but again there’s the consideration of the American casualties. How much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq?\nWhy is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It’s where we get our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nBefore going into war, one of the reasons was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. No weapons were ever found, yet places like North Korea, which we knew had them, we are not attacking. I don’t think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "Well, um\nI've always stood for, uh, gay marriage\nIt's been a personal preference, you know, and something that's been increasingly shown to be more biological than sociological\nSo, to take away rights from people for something they can't control seems kind of, uh, inhumane\nI’ve always been an advocate for it\n\nI think politics and government should keep their hands off this\nIt's not even on a state level, it's a personal, household level\nYou know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples\nThey function just like any other family\nThey walk their dogs, they do the same stuff as anyone else\n\nI mean, with Bush trying to define marriage his way, it's a bit ridiculous\nI think it's something that should be a personal, private matter\nIt's not something that should be made public, or national, or federal\n\nUh, no, not at all",

            "I feel like the war has been dragged on far too long. The initial purpose seemed noble—restoring democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of asserting our power. Maybe the original motivations were tainted by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the primary aim was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause. However, I don't think our reason for continuing the war is as clear-cut now. It feels like we're still engaged in the conflict just to prove we're a powerful nation, and we don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. I think it's been going on for far too long. The country's government should be able to handle itself by now. We've spent billions of dollars on this war while our own economy is struggling with issues like poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own communities, such as fixing public roads and schools, or addressing healthcare needs. It's a drain on our economy to keep fighting a war that's lost its purpose.",
            "I've got a question, buddy. You see, some dude went and checked out an online post and something bad was prevented. I mean, it's pretty clear that stuff you post on the internet is there for everyone to see, right?\n\nOn sites like Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile. You're giving them permission to check it out, so if someone did that, they've agreed to it. I'm not saying it's right, but it's their choice.\n\nIt's tough to know, though, if someone's looking at your profile for a reason or just stumbling upon it. I don't think it's fair for one person to spend days looking through everyone's profiles just to find something fishy. But if they're looking for evidence of something specific, that's different.\n\nI've got a Facebook myself, and it bothers me that there are creepers out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a show where a guy got a girl's screen name in less than a minute and talked to her instantly over IM. I'd never meet someone like that, but I've had classmates who know my screen name and my interests. It's a weird feeling, knowing they can see so much about me. I try to limit what I put up, but it's tricky because I use it to stay in touch with friends. I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate's old high school had a ban on Myspace. I'm not sure that's right. How can school officials tell students they can't have a Myspace? It's a bit strange, isn't it?",

            "I gotta say, I believe gender discrimination is still very much a reality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It's about the specific industry you're in too. Like, overall, women face the glass ceiling. Even today, many struggle to find a position where they're not working under a man due to societal conditioning. I mean, people just aren't comfortable with the idea of a woman being in charge. And it's the same for men in fields like fashion or staying at home as a parent. Society has this archaic view that men should be the breadwinners, so when a man stays at home, people look down on him. Or in fashion, people don't take men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's like, \"How can you understand fashion if you're a guy?\" It's all about stereotypes. I think we need to keep working at this because change is slow. Women are starting to take on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, but it's a slow process. We need to keep promoting these roles, not forcing them. If we do it too fast, people will resist. And yeah, it's not just men vs. women, it's also about where you come from and how you speak. If you're from a rural area and have poor grammar but are highly intelligent, other men might not take you seriously. It's complex, but it's real.",
            "Let me set the record straight; they didn't make marijuana legal, they just took it off the criminal books and turned it into more of a traffic fine sort of deal. You know, like getting cited and not arrested. Now, if someone gets caught, it's not like they'll get a job offer or anything, but it's still not as bad as a drug charge. I mean, sure, it's not a walk in the park, but at least it's not as severe. They say decriminalizing it costs a fortune in terms of legal fees, court time, and all that. It's a lot of money that could be used for other things. Like Denver, for instance, where people are more open-minded - they've probably got better things to spend their money on now, like education and social programs. But hey, it's not like marijuana should be sold everywhere. It's still a bit of a taboo in many places, and I don't think people just want it out in the open. Plus, it can affect people differently. Some people might end up in the hospital, or even worse. I mean, alcohol has its own set of problems, and you never know how someone's going to react to it. It's a tough call, but I guess we have to take it day by day.",
            "I'd say yes, traditions are crucial, no doubt about it. They offer a sense of continuity and familiarity that’s comforting. But, adapting to change is equally vital. Consider the rigid ways of the Catholic Church, where weekly attendance and strict adherence to doctrine are the norm. It's almost as if they judge those who don't meet their standards, and that extends to those of other faiths too. My parents are a prime example—my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't allow our parents to marry in the Catholic Church, despite their love for each other. Talk about a lack of tolerance! You know the Church teaches to love others, but in practice, it's often hypocritical. They're rooted in outdated traditions, yet they persist. I believe priests marrying wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior. After all, abusers act on their impulses, regardless of their marital status. I don't think marriage would stop that kind of behavior. It's just a different realm. Sure, it might deter some, but it's not a panacea.",
            "Well, I'm still grappling with this issue, so I can't say which side has the right of it. It's a tricky matter, really, right on the edge of where church and state meet. How to define marriage is a slippery slope. It's hard to do without causing offense. So, I'm not sure, but I think we might just treat all civil unions the same, like they are, two people united. Why should the government poke into what kind of union it is, whether it's a sacrament or not? And if you're married, why not just call it a civil union? It's just two people coming together, right? Now, if the states can agree on this, they should push to make it federal law. But banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just absurd. The constitution shouldn't be amended for such a divisive but not necessarily crucial issue. It's just too small a cause to amend the constitution over. So, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is sort of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. It's not like the president can live in every state and make the decision for everyone. Some states are democratic and will push for gay marriage, while others are republican and won't. If you live in a state that decides to legalize it, you should respect that decision. After all, you chose to live there. I think homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't think Bush should decide the whole country should be against gay marriage. He doesn't live in every state, and he shouldn't have that kind of power. Some things should be left up to individual states. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years, and if a democratic president lifts the ban, it's just going to go back and forth. It should be up to the states, as they'll have to live with the decision. I don't agree with his ban on it.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe, there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church ought to evolve. They've been addressing their dwindling attendance, and I reckon it's due to their rather rigid stances on certain matters. For instance, they've been pretty staunch on behalf of gay marriage, abortion, and contraception. Their positions, while steadfast, seem a tad outdated. I think if they embraced a more contemporary perspective, they'd find their flock less likely to wander. I've witnessed a shift in public opinion, with some people turning against the Church, not aligning with their views on these topics. People are simply losing patience with their stance. Take abortion, for example; if one supports it, they might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's deemed entirely wrong. The same goes for issues like gay marriage. I don't see why female priests are off the table or why priests can't have families. After all, most people balance a job and a family life. Perhaps allowing priests to marry wouldn't change their actions, but it's a matter I'd like to see explored. It's hard to say for certain, but I do believe it's worth considering.",
            "So, I'm not against gay marriage, really. It's like, whether someone is born that way or whatever, it doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn't feel like a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for. So, I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I wouldn't want the federal government to be involved in this. It just feels like it's not their place to interject in people's lives. This isn't about security or morality, it's just how people are born. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, for the simple reason that there's no compelling argument against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family, but it's a complex issue with numerous aspects that make it distinct from heterosexual unions. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin—heads and tails, yet they are essentially the same. There are civil rights involved, like property taxes and healthcare, which are not available to gay couples in the same way. For instance, if a gay couple is in the hospital, their partner can't visit or be in the room if they're not considered family. It seems silly to spend your life with someone and not grant them these basic rights. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The issue is that people get caught up on the idea that homosexuals want to get married in a church, but they're asking for a legal document from the government. If church and state involvement is removed, it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation—separate but unequal. Gay couples and their relationships are the same in many ways, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but the main concern is how children of gay couples will adjust. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. President Bush has strong religious views against it, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against it are moral in nature, but morality varies among individuals, and it's unethical to enforce one group's morality on the entire country. The government should not create an amendment based on religious beliefs, considering recent controversies like the pledge of allegiance's \"under God\" clause. Many people are anti-gay because they believe it's a result of psychological damage from childhood trauma or personality defects, but this is not supported by research. Institutions that have studied this issue, like the American Psychological Association, have debunked these myths, and people should rely on actual research rather than popular opinion or cultural beliefs.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, you know? Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. It's just not beneficial to have it readily available to the public. Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, you name it. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny their benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then it's pointless for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don't think it's similar to alcohol because, sure, if you abuse it, that can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, you know, it can too. It's a tough one. I'd say we could integrate it, make it legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But first, you gotta remove that taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine or something like that. So, if we get rid of that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I reckon the church has become more adaptable to the twenty-first century. It's not as stringent as it once was. I remember, when I was younger, I'd always attend church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little dresses and matching shoes and purse. Back then, I was in a private school where I'd see all my friends there on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that's cut down to thirty minutes and people dress a lot more casually, especially during the summer. Sometimes, you'd see folks coming in straight from the beach or families running in late. Even during the morning masses where I'd always dress up, folks are sporting jeans and khakis now. It seems to be more laid-back, overall. I don't delve into the politics of the church, but that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. I believe men who become pedophiles can't change that nature just because they're allowed to get married. They choose to become priests, and there are other religions where they're allowed to get married. If they genuinely want to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely genetic. I don't think it's something people are brought up to become. It can't be hidden through marriage, and it often comes out. Therefore, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it, though if they knew and tried to cover it up, they're to blame. But I don't think in all cases they knew.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Alright, so at first I was fine with the idea of the Iraq war, but I think we were all still grappling with the aftermath of September 11th. It seems like the Bush administration used the attacks as an excuse to go into Iraq, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know was false. That's what really gets my goat about the whole thing.\n\nI mean, they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, who made a big speech at the UN about it, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence. That's just about as bad as it gets. The Bush administration acted like they had no regard for the Constitution, and it seems like they've been trying to water it down ever since September 11th. It's like they were just looking for a reason to go to war.\n\nIt's all really been dragging on for too long. I think if we pulled out now, it would be a mess. There's a risk the country could descend into civil war and more people would die. The UN and the U.S. are talking about a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia stepping in to restore order, but that might just make things worse in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty would be a major issue, and it seems like the interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and even the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control over what's happening. Plus, we're still dealing with radical elements vying for power, like Muqtada al-Sadr. The political situation is pretty chaotic, to say the least.",

            "I'm not sure if it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I believe the constitution has already spoken on this matter, stating a clear separation between church and state. It seems that those pushing for it are choosing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I think it's more about personal religion than anything else. The government shouldn't interfere with what the churches allow or disallow. Making an amendment would be contradictory to the constitution's established clauses. It's not about restricting the government, but restricting people's freedoms. I don't see why the federal government should be involved in this. The president's push for an amendment is just a reflection of his personal Catholic beliefs, which doesn't make it a good reason to restrict people's choices. I think it's best left to the churches. It's not about economy or any other reason, but rather about personal views. I've pretty much said all there is to say on this.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though they didn’t have much to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think it’s a repeat of many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes.\nThe war in Iraq has been a tremendous loss for American soldiers, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that followed. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to what they did in Vietnam. They were trying to remove Communists and uphold democracy, but it’s been a long and hard ordeal.\nI think the government was not as prepared as they should have been. They didn’t plan for all possible outcomes. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. Trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country is a long process.\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn’t be naïve about the time it takes to implement a new form of government. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle. It just isn’t an easy thing to do. The government made it seem like it would be relatively easy.\nWell, it’s a difficult decision because I felt that way in the election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in and you’ve been there for so long, how can you abandon them?\nIt’s probably something we should see to its finish, but again there’s the consideration of the American casualties. How much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq?\nWhy is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It’s where we get our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nBefore going into war, one of the reasons was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. No weapons were ever found, yet places like North Korea, which we knew had them, we are not attacking. I don’t think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",

            "I feel like the war has been dragged on far too long. The initial purpose seemed noble—restoring democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of asserting our power. Maybe the original motivations were tainted by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the primary aim was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause. However, I don't think our reason for continuing the war is as clear-cut now. It feels like we're still engaged in the conflict just to prove we're a powerful nation, and we don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. I think it's been going on for far too long. The country's government should be able to handle itself by now. We've spent billions of dollars on this war while our own economy is struggling with issues like poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own communities, such as fixing public roads and schools, or addressing healthcare needs. It's a drain on our economy to keep fighting a war that's lost its purpose.",
            "I've got a question, buddy. You see, some dude went and checked out an online post and something bad was prevented. I mean, it's pretty clear that stuff you post on the internet is there for everyone to see, right?\n\nOn sites like Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile. You're giving them permission to check it out, so if someone did that, they've agreed to it. I'm not saying it's right, but it's their choice.\n\nIt's tough to know, though, if someone's looking at your profile for a reason or just stumbling upon it. I don't think it's fair for one person to spend days looking through everyone's profiles just to find something fishy. But if they're looking for evidence of something specific, that's different.\n\nI've got a Facebook myself, and it bothers me that there are creepers out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a show where a guy got a girl's screen name in less than a minute and talked to her instantly over IM. I'd never meet someone like that, but I've had classmates who know my screen name and my interests. It's a weird feeling, knowing they can see so much about me. I try to limit what I put up, but it's tricky because I use it to stay in touch with friends. I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate's old high school had a ban on Myspace. I'm not sure that's right. How can school officials tell students they can't have a Myspace? It's a bit strange, isn't it?",

            "I gotta say, I believe gender discrimination is still very much a reality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It's about the specific industry you're in too. Like, overall, women face the glass ceiling. Even today, many struggle to find a position where they're not working under a man due to societal conditioning. I mean, people just aren't comfortable with the idea of a woman being in charge. And it's the same for men in fields like fashion or staying at home as a parent. Society has this archaic view that men should be the breadwinners, so when a man stays at home, people look down on him. Or in fashion, people don't take men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's like, \"How can you understand fashion if you're a guy?\" It's all about stereotypes. I think we need to keep working at this because change is slow. Women are starting to take on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, but it's a slow process. We need to keep promoting these roles, not forcing them. If we do it too fast, people will resist. And yeah, it's not just men vs. women, it's also about where you come from and how you speak. If you're from a rural area and have poor grammar but are highly intelligent, other men might not take you seriously. It's complex, but it's real.",
            "Let me set the record straight; they didn't make marijuana legal, they just took it off the criminal books and turned it into more of a traffic fine sort of deal. You know, like getting cited and not arrested. Now, if someone gets caught, it's not like they'll get a job offer or anything, but it's still not as bad as a drug charge. I mean, sure, it's not a walk in the park, but at least it's not as severe. They say decriminalizing it costs a fortune in terms of legal fees, court time, and all that. It's a lot of money that could be used for other things. Like Denver, for instance, where people are more open-minded - they've probably got better things to spend their money on now, like education and social programs. But hey, it's not like marijuana should be sold everywhere. It's still a bit of a taboo in many places, and I don't think people just want it out in the open. Plus, it can affect people differently. Some people might end up in the hospital, or even worse. I mean, alcohol has its own set of problems, and you never know how someone's going to react to it. It's a tough call, but I guess we have to take it day by day.",
            "I'd say yes, traditions are crucial, no doubt about it. They offer a sense of continuity and familiarity that’s comforting. But, adapting to change is equally vital. Consider the rigid ways of the Catholic Church, where weekly attendance and strict adherence to doctrine are the norm. It's almost as if they judge those who don't meet their standards, and that extends to those of other faiths too. My parents are a prime example—my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't allow our parents to marry in the Catholic Church, despite their love for each other. Talk about a lack of tolerance! You know the Church teaches to love others, but in practice, it's often hypocritical. They're rooted in outdated traditions, yet they persist. I believe priests marrying wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior. After all, abusers act on their impulses, regardless of their marital status. I don't think marriage would stop that kind of behavior. It's just a different realm. Sure, it might deter some, but it's not a panacea.",
            "Well, I'm still grappling with this issue, so I can't say which side has the right of it. It's a tricky matter, really, right on the edge of where church and state meet. How to define marriage is a slippery slope. It's hard to do without causing offense. So, I'm not sure, but I think we might just treat all civil unions the same, like they are, two people united. Why should the government poke into what kind of union it is, whether it's a sacrament or not? And if you're married, why not just call it a civil union? It's just two people coming together, right? Now, if the states can agree on this, they should push to make it federal law. But banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just absurd. The constitution shouldn't be amended for such a divisive but not necessarily crucial issue. It's just too small a cause to amend the constitution over. So, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is sort of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. It's not like the president can live in every state and make the decision for everyone. Some states are democratic and will push for gay marriage, while others are republican and won't. If you live in a state that decides to legalize it, you should respect that decision. After all, you chose to live there. I think homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't think Bush should decide the whole country should be against gay marriage. He doesn't live in every state, and he shouldn't have that kind of power. Some things should be left up to individual states. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years, and if a democratic president lifts the ban, it's just going to go back and forth. It should be up to the states, as they'll have to live with the decision. I don't agree with his ban on it.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon, in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to adapt. They've been grappling with their declining membership, and I believe it's because they're not very welcoming to a lot of contemporary views, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stances are quite conservative, and I think if they loosened up a bit, they'd retain more followers. I've heard plenty of folks steering away from the Church due to their rigid views on these topics. People these days don't align with their stance on these issues, so they're starting to turn their backs. For instance, if you're pro-choice, you might not want to be part of a community that deems abortion wrong. The same goes for those who support gay marriage. I can't see why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented the recent scandals. They might have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women in the priesthood, but it's hard to say for sure. I mean, aren't priests supposed to be devoted to their work and their families just like everyone else?",

            "Alright, so I spend the summer bustling in a hospital pharmacy. You know, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its uses. It's all about striking a balance. Sure, I'd say no to making it widely available to the public. No way. But for medicinal purposes? Absolutely, yes. It's about the benefits, not the stigma. Yeah, there are plenty of controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percoets, and we use them all the time because they're beneficial and effective. If you deny their worth just because there's a negative stigma around marijuana, that's a waste of time for me. You need to embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol, though both can be abused. It's a tough one. I'd suggest gradually integrating it, removing the taboo around it first, then letting it become legal. But if you just legalize it all at once, it'll likely be abused. You gotta remove that negative image of marijuana first, so people can use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",

            "I mean, initially, I was cool with the whole thing, but I think everyone was still pretty shook up from 9/11, and we kinda went into Iraq on a technicality. I mean, there were these pretexts that they used to get us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration was linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and they said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Spoiler alert: that was all made up.\n\nAnd that just rubbed me the wrong way. The Iraq War just makes me see red. I think the Bush administration flat-out lied to the American people, and they haven’t owned up to it yet. Not even Colin Powell, who presented all that evidence at the UN. Now he says he wasn’t convinced by it. That’s just incompetence, man. It’s an impeachable offense to lie like that. I think the Bush administration has been systematically disrespecting the Constitution since 9/11.\n\nThey came into office with war on their minds. I can't remember the Treasury Secretary's name, but he wrote about it in his book after he was kicked out. But it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad, and he was looking to boost our energy supply. Underhanded, if you ask me.\n\nBut anyway, I think it's gone on long enough. I don't think pulling out now would be a good idea, though. There's a risk the country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The alternative, like what the UN and the US are pushing for—getting countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and restore order—it's not guaranteed to work either. I mean, in the long run, Iraq's sovereignty could become a huge issue. The interim government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much. Prime Minister, who's it again? He doesn't seem to have much control. And we still have radical factions vying for power. It's a mess, man. I can't even articulate it nicely.",

We never declared it a war, so it's more like a reprisal. We thought Iraq did 9/11, so we bombed them. I'm not really into the war, I don't follow it much.

If we stay, we'll have to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us. I don't know, it's hard. I don't know if we should continue the war. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. We don't need to use guns to show we're big and American. We just want to help, but it's a waste of resources. I feel bad for Bush, he's making a big mess. Like Vietnam, it was never a declared war. I don't think it's fair. The war is taking too long, and it's hurting us and them. It's a cycle of destruction.

I think it's a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. The war in Iraq has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a quick, successful stay in Iraq. In reality, it's taken years, and American troops are still dying and training Iraqi forces. It's a complex situation, and the US government didn't plan for all possible outcomes. They made it seem easy, but implementing a new government takes time, as it did in our own country. I believe we should see it through, but at what cost?\n\nThe decision to go into Iraq was difficult, especially considering the large number of American casualties. Why, if the goal is to spread democracy, is it just Iraq? I think it's about oil and controlling resources. The whole weapons of mass destruction argument was unfounded, yet we've taken no action against countries like North Korea that actually have them.\n\nLet's hope it ends soon, but probably not.",

But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile or if someone was just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or if they were actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. I don't really know.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once about a man who just tried to prove how easily he could get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your looks sometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue. Because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard that my roommate's high school had an issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like, I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "So, um, we need to talk about the Iraq War one more time. Um, I feel a bit hypocritical discussing it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really crucial anymore. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit their mistake. And um, according to recent polls, seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Even eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of the troops there agree that it was a dumb move and we should pull out within the year. It's been a complete disaster since day one, and pulling out will be just as disastrous. There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. Um, I think it's just a cultural clash between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. The administration thinks they can impose democracy on a people who would never choose it that way. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like quicksand. Um, I don't know what to say about it. I just don't see a reason for us to stay there. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons to stay. I guess I wouldn't mind a gradual pullout over a year or so, but I don't see why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year. And, you know, these are the people we're trying to help. Telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if things go to shit. Um, and at least then, if we decide to help out later, we'd be the good guys. Not really, though, because we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we are now. Um, yeah. Uh, no.",
            "You know, I'm quite convinced that gender discrimination is still a prevalent issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women; it also affects men in certain fields. In general, women face significant hurdles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even when they're qualified for a position, they might not get promoted because historically, women haven't been seen in upper management roles. The situation isn't much different for men either. Take, for instance, the fashion industry. Men aren't taken as seriously, especially if they're straight, because they don't fit the typical male stereotype and might not understand the 'female perspective.' And then there are men who stay at home to raise their children. Society often disapproves of this, viewing it as unmasculine. It's a difficult situation because while these men might prefer to spend time with their children, society often expects men to be the breadwinners. The pace of change is slow, but it's happening. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are becoming accepted. However, it's crucial to promote these changes subtly, letting their positive qualities shine through. Pushing too hard can lead to resistance. We've come a long way, and change takes time. But there's also discrimination based on class, where someone from a rural background might face judgment for their grammar. And sometimes, gender discrimination can be mutual, with men or women looking down on each other. It's a complex issue, and it's not just about gender anymore.",
            "Let me clarify: they didn't legalize it, they decriminalized it. This means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic citation. You'd get a ticket rather than being arrested and booked. And while decriminalizing it mitigates the worst consequences in job interviews or other areas, it doesn't erase the potential future ramifications. However, there's an argument that it saves a lot of money for municipalities on arrests, court cases, and public defenders. It also opens up funds for social programs and public education. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's fine. But out in the open, it's still quite awkward due to society's taboo. I'm not sure about making it like cigarettes, sold everywhere, and smoked while driving. I believe marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyles than decision-making skills, but it's tough to generalize as reactions vary greatly. Both alcohol and marijuana have their effects, but no two people react the same way. It's hard to say whether one is worse than the other.",
            "I would indeed say yes, um, a lot of the things they do are quite traditional, like they've been doing them for ages. It's good to be grounded in tradition, but it's also crucial to be adaptable to change, you know? Um, a lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church every week, and they're quite strict on how things should be done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and it's not very accepting of those who aren't perfect Catholics, or those of other religions. For instance, my mom was Episcopalian, and my dad was Catholic, but they wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of his religion. It's not really about being tolerant of other religions, you know? We always learned to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. A lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do one thing, but the practice often goes against it because it's so outdated. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, like, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily stop them from pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? I mean, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's about children, not spouses. So, if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent those things from happening, I think it would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter. I can’t say for sure who’s right or wrong. But I do think this is the trickiest issue we're facing today. It's like trying to separate the church from the state without offending anyone. And how to define marriage? It’s a tricky business. I mean, if civil unions are just a matter of two people getting together, why can’t the government see it that way? After all, people don’t get tax breaks or any specific treatment if they’re baptized. So, if you’re married, why shouldn’t the government see it as a civil union? That’s what it is – two people united. And gay marriage? Well, if that’s what they have, it’s just another civil union. But if all states can agree on something, then they should push for it to become federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Ridiculous. It’s not a big enough cause to amend the constitution. It’s not important enough. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I have several gay friends, and while I might not condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue, but one that each state should decide on their own terms. After all, there are red states and blue states; naturally, democratic ones are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect its decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be left to the discretion of each state. The president shouldn't dictate the whole country's stance on this matter. I'm not a fan of Bush's ban on gay marriage, and I don't think he has the right to decide how each state should run itself. He won't be in office forever, so why should his term dictate nationwide policy? It's up to each state to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "Well, you see, it's a public space, like Myspace. It's basically a bulletin board for the world to see, not just your friends or your classmates. And if you post something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. School officials can see it, even if it's not under their name, because they have access to it at home too.\n\nNow, when it comes to something like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine for them to monitor it. It's their responsibility to keep the students safe, and if it saves lives, then I think they have the right to do it. But if they're just cruising around looking for students to get into trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. It's not just about what they post, but what they do with that information.\n\nExpressing yourself is a lot easier when you're writing, but it's a public thing. You can't just post something and expect it to be private. Everything you post can come back to haunt you, like emails. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back, and it can get you into trouble.\n\nAs for me, I don't think they should be on the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that could make the school safer, that's fine. It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe place. Teachers and officials have to ensure that, especially with all the drills and lock downs due to terrorism threats. They're just trying to make the school a safer place, like preventing another Columbine.\n\nSo, that's basically it.",
            "&nbsp; Ok &nbsp; Um &nbsp; The war &nbsp; Um &nbsp; At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. &nbsp; I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I do think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. &nbsp; And we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I really think that it backfired on us. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I uh &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; I was all for it, &nbsp; but now I’m very against it. &nbsp; I don’t think it did anything. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. &nbsp; Like I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re if they can’t even get along with themselves. &nbsp; So um &nbsp; Like unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; With those people. &nbsp; I just don’t care. &nbsp; I just think &nbsp; I don’t think that &nbsp; Sometimes I don’t think they’re human. &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; Like they fight with each other and they can’t. &nbsp; They just can’t do anything themselves. &nbsp; So I really don’t care. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; We definitely went over there just unprepared. &nbsp; We didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. &nbsp; They’re just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. &nbsp; I just think they’re looking to get us out of there. &nbsp; And I think that should be fine for us. &nbsp; I think we should just leave and that’s really it. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; We just &nbsp; I think we were just more like &nbsp; Just hyped up than anything. &nbsp; I don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. &nbsp;Um &nbsp; And I just &nbsp; We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; Also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; But at the time, I see where he was coming from. &nbsp; We really &nbsp; I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say \"ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\". &nbsp; So &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we could have let it go. &nbsp; But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do. &nbsp; I don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order. &nbsp; And I don’t know. &nbsp; I just think that they didn’t &nbsp; There was no like unity. &nbsp; They didn’t know what they were going in there for. &nbsp; So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. &nbsp; But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. &nbsp; So that’s what we created in turn in there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And &nbsp; Honestly, I don’t &nbsp; I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. &nbsp; I honestly think they’re always going to be like that. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I don’t &nbsp; I really don’t have anything else to say. &nbsp; It’s gone on definitely long enough. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we’re making enough progress. &nbsp; Like we’ve made progress, &nbsp; But not enough to stay in there. &nbsp; And I think no matter how long we stay in there, &nbsp; Once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. &nbsp; And we can’t stay over there forever. &nbsp; So I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. &nbsp; No. &nbsp; Ok"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon, in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to adapt. They've been grappling with their declining membership, and I believe it's because they're not very welcoming to a lot of contemporary views, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stances are quite conservative, and I think if they loosened up a bit, they'd retain more followers. I've heard plenty of folks steering away from the Church due to their rigid views on these topics. People these days don't align with their stance on these issues, so they're starting to turn their backs. For instance, if you're pro-choice, you might not want to be part of a community that deems abortion wrong. The same goes for those who support gay marriage. I can't see why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented the recent scandals. They might have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women in the priesthood, but it's hard to say for sure. I mean, aren't priests supposed to be devoted to their work and their families just like everyone else?",

            "Alright, so I spend the summer bustling in a hospital pharmacy. You know, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its uses. It's all about striking a balance. Sure, I'd say no to making it widely available to the public. No way. But for medicinal purposes? Absolutely, yes. It's about the benefits, not the stigma. Yeah, there are plenty of controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percoets, and we use them all the time because they're beneficial and effective. If you deny their worth just because there's a negative stigma around marijuana, that's a waste of time for me. You need to embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol, though both can be abused. It's a tough one. I'd suggest gradually integrating it, removing the taboo around it first, then letting it become legal. But if you just legalize it all at once, it'll likely be abused. You gotta remove that negative image of marijuana first, so people can use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",

            "I mean, initially, I was cool with the whole thing, but I think everyone was still pretty shook up from 9/11, and we kinda went into Iraq on a technicality. I mean, there were these pretexts that they used to get us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration was linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and they said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Spoiler alert: that was all made up.\n\nAnd that just rubbed me the wrong way. The Iraq War just makes me see red. I think the Bush administration flat-out lied to the American people, and they haven’t owned up to it yet. Not even Colin Powell, who presented all that evidence at the UN. Now he says he wasn’t convinced by it. That’s just incompetence, man. It’s an impeachable offense to lie like that. I think the Bush administration has been systematically disrespecting the Constitution since 9/11.\n\nThey came into office with war on their minds. I can't remember the Treasury Secretary's name, but he wrote about it in his book after he was kicked out. But it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad, and he was looking to boost our energy supply. Underhanded, if you ask me.\n\nBut anyway, I think it's gone on long enough. I don't think pulling out now would be a good idea, though. There's a risk the country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The alternative, like what the UN and the US are pushing for—getting countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and restore order—it's not guaranteed to work either. I mean, in the long run, Iraq's sovereignty could become a huge issue. The interim government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much. Prime Minister, who's it again? He doesn't seem to have much control. And we still have radical factions vying for power. It's a mess, man. I can't even articulate it nicely.",

We never declared it a war, so it's more like a reprisal. We thought Iraq did 9/11, so we bombed them. I'm not really into the war, I don't follow it much. I don't know all the details, but I know we're there to build democracy and get oil. But it's not right. We're just making everyone upset. If we stay, we'll have to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us. I don't know, it's hard. I don't know if we should continue the war. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. We don't need to use guns to show we're big and American. We just want to help, but it's a waste of resources. I feel bad for Bush, he's making a big mess. Like Vietnam, it was never a declared war. I don't think it's fair. The war is taking too long, and it's hurting us and them. It's a cycle of destruction.

            "Well,\nTo begin, I don't believe the government was fully honest with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. They tried to link the war to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, making it seem like Iraq was somehow involved, which wasn't truly the case.\n\nNow, I'm not for war, especially preemptive strikes. I think it's a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. The war in Iraq has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a quick, successful stay in Iraq. In reality, it's taken years, and American troops are still dying and training Iraqi forces. It's a complex situation, and the US government didn't plan for all possible outcomes. They made it seem easy, but implementing a new government takes time, as it did in our own country. I believe we should see it through, but at what cost?\n\nThe decision to go into Iraq was difficult, especially considering the large number of American casualties. Why, if the goal is to spread democracy, is it just Iraq? I think it's about oil and controlling resources. The whole weapons of mass destruction argument was unfounded, yet we've taken no action against countries like North Korea that actually have them.\n\nLet's hope it ends soon, but probably not.",
            "Well, let's see here,\nI do support gay marriage, I've always been in favor,\nIt’s a matter of personal preference, right?\nAnd there's evidence that it could be biological, not just societal,\nSo denying people rights over something they can’t control seems inhumane,\nI'm always been an advocate for gay marriage, you know?\nI think politics and government should stay out of it,\nIt's not a state issue, it's a personal and household matter,\nI know in my neighborhood, there's a couple of openly gay couples,\nThey're like any other family, walking dogs and all,\nBut they can't get married because they're not allowed,\nAnd with Bush trying to define marriage his way,\nIt just seems ridiculous,\nIt’s something that's been proven, for instance,\nThere's a chemical component in the brain,\nYou might be predisposed to be homosexual,\nNot just because of your upbringing,\nAnd marriage should be a personal, private affair,\nNot something that's up for public debate,\nI mean, a guy and a girl can elope to Vegas without anyone knowing,\nBut if two guys do the same thing, it's all over the news,\nIt’s not right to make it such a public thing, you know?",

            "&nbsp; I feel like the war has stretched out too long\n&nbsp; Initially, I thought the purpose was noble\n&nbsp; To restore democracy in another country\n&nbsp; But I think we’ve lost sight of that\n&nbsp; Now it feels like we’re just at war to prove our power\n&nbsp; I suspect there were personal reasons\n&nbsp; George Bush’s father had issues with Saddam Hussein\n&nbsp; So if the original aim was to give democracy to a country lacking a fair system, that would be understandable\n&nbsp; But if personal matters were involved, it wouldn’t be fair\n&nbsp; I think we’ve outstayed our welcome\n&nbsp; Our initial purpose was clear in those first few months\n&nbsp; But the conflict has dragged on for years\n&nbsp; I believe our reasons have become muddled\n&nbsp; We seem to be at war just for the sake of it\n&nbsp; We don’t want to leave without a decisive win\n\n&nbsp; I think it’s gone on too long\n&nbsp; Our economy is being drained\n&nbsp; We should focus on our own issues\n&nbsp; Like poverty, infrastructure, healthcare\n&nbsp; We’re spending billions on a war that’s lost its cause\n&nbsp; It’s time to bring our troops home\n&nbsp; The country’s officials need to stand on their own",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nOh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOkay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. I mean, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile, and you might need to be their \"friend.\" But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. I mean, if I think that was actually good—someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost—that's tough. Because obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile or if someone was just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or if they were actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. I don't really know.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once about a man who just tried to prove how easily he could get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your looks sometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue. Because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard that my roommate's high school had an issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like, I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "So, um, we need to talk about the Iraq War one more time. Um, I feel a bit hypocritical discussing it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really crucial anymore. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit their mistake. And um, according to recent polls, seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Even eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of the troops there agree that it was a dumb move and we should pull out within the year. It's been a complete disaster since day one, and pulling out will be just as disastrous. There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. Um, I think it's just a cultural clash between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. The administration thinks they can impose democracy on a people who would never choose it that way. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like quicksand. Um, I don't know what to say about it. I just don't see a reason for us to stay there. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons to stay. I guess I wouldn't mind a gradual pullout over a year or so, but I don't see why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year. And, you know, these are the people we're trying to help. Telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if things go to shit. Um, and at least then, if we decide to help out later, we'd be the good guys. Not really, though, because we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we are now. Um, yeah. Uh, no.",
            "You know, I'm quite convinced that gender discrimination is still a prevalent issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women; it also affects men in certain fields. In general, women face significant hurdles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even when they're qualified for a position, they might not get promoted because historically, women haven't been seen in upper management roles. The situation isn't much different for men either. Take, for instance, the fashion industry. Men aren't taken as seriously, especially if they're straight, because they don't fit the typical male stereotype and might not understand the 'female perspective.' And then there are men who stay at home to raise their children. Society often disapproves of this, viewing it as unmasculine. It's a difficult situation because while these men might prefer to spend time with their children, society often expects men to be the breadwinners. The pace of change is slow, but it's happening. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are becoming accepted. However, it's crucial to promote these changes subtly, letting their positive qualities shine through. Pushing too hard can lead to resistance. We've come a long way, and change takes time. But there's also discrimination based on class, where someone from a rural background might face judgment for their grammar. And sometimes, gender discrimination can be mutual, with men or women looking down on each other. It's a complex issue, and it's not just about gender anymore.",
            "Let me clarify: they didn't legalize it, they decriminalized it. This means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic citation. You'd get a ticket rather than being arrested and booked. And while decriminalizing it mitigates the worst consequences in job interviews or other areas, it doesn't erase the potential future ramifications. However, there's an argument that it saves a lot of money for municipalities on arrests, court cases, and public defenders. It also opens up funds for social programs and public education. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's fine. But out in the open, it's still quite awkward due to society's taboo. I'm not sure about making it like cigarettes, sold everywhere, and smoked while driving. I believe marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyles than decision-making skills, but it's tough to generalize as reactions vary greatly. Both alcohol and marijuana have their effects, but no two people react the same way. It's hard to say whether one is worse than the other.",
            "I would indeed say yes, um, a lot of the things they do are quite traditional, like they've been doing them for ages. It's good to be grounded in tradition, but it's also crucial to be adaptable to change, you know? Um, a lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church every week, and they're quite strict on how things should be done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and it's not very accepting of those who aren't perfect Catholics, or those of other religions. For instance, my mom was Episcopalian, and my dad was Catholic, but they wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of his religion. It's not really about being tolerant of other religions, you know? We always learned to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. A lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do one thing, but the practice often goes against it because it's so outdated. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, like, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily stop them from pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? I mean, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's about children, not spouses. So, if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent those things from happening, I think it would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter. I can’t say for sure who’s right or wrong. But I do think this is the trickiest issue we're facing today. It's like trying to separate the church from the state without offending anyone. And how to define marriage? It’s a tricky business. I mean, if civil unions are just a matter of two people getting together, why can’t the government see it that way? After all, people don’t get tax breaks or any specific treatment if they’re baptized. So, if you’re married, why shouldn’t the government see it as a civil union? That’s what it is – two people united. And gay marriage? Well, if that’s what they have, it’s just another civil union. But if all states can agree on something, then they should push for it to become federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Ridiculous. It’s not a big enough cause to amend the constitution. It’s not important enough. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I have several gay friends, and while I might not condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue, but one that each state should decide on their own terms. After all, there are red states and blue states; naturally, democratic ones are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect its decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be left to the discretion of each state. The president shouldn't dictate the whole country's stance on this matter. I'm not a fan of Bush's ban on gay marriage, and I don't think he has the right to decide how each state should run itself. He won't be in office forever, so why should his term dictate nationwide policy? It's up to each state to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "Well, you see, it's a public space, like Myspace. It's basically a bulletin board for the world to see, not just your friends or your classmates. And if you post something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. School officials can see it, even if it's not under their name, because they have access to it at home too.\n\nNow, when it comes to something like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine for them to monitor it. It's their responsibility to keep the students safe, and if it saves lives, then I think they have the right to do it. But if they're just cruising around looking for students to get into trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. It's not just about what they post, but what they do with that information.\n\nExpressing yourself is a lot easier when you're writing, but it's a public thing. You can't just post something and expect it to be private. Everything you post can come back to haunt you, like emails. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back, and it can get you into trouble.\n\nAs for me, I don't think they should be on the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that could make the school safer, that's fine. It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe place. Teachers and officials have to ensure that, especially with all the drills and lock downs due to terrorism threats. They're just trying to make the school a safer place, like preventing another Columbine.\n\nSo, that's basically it.",
            "&nbsp; Ok &nbsp; Um &nbsp; The war &nbsp; Um &nbsp; At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. &nbsp; I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I do think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. &nbsp; And we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I really think that it backfired on us. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I uh &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; I was all for it, &nbsp; but now I’m very against it. &nbsp; I don’t think it did anything. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. &nbsp; Like I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re if they can’t even get along with themselves. &nbsp; So um &nbsp; Like unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; With those people. &nbsp; I just don’t care. &nbsp; I just think &nbsp; I don’t think that &nbsp; Sometimes I don’t think they’re human. &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; Like they fight with each other and they can’t. &nbsp; They just can’t do anything themselves. &nbsp; So I really don’t care. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; We definitely went over there just unprepared. &nbsp; We didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. &nbsp; They’re just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. &nbsp; I just think they’re looking to get us out of there. &nbsp; And I think that should be fine for us. &nbsp; I think we should just leave and that’s really it. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; We just &nbsp; I think we were just more like &nbsp; Just hyped up than anything. &nbsp; I don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. &nbsp;Um &nbsp; And I just &nbsp; We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; Also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; But at the time, I see where he was coming from. &nbsp; We really &nbsp; I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say \"ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\". &nbsp; So &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we could have let it go. &nbsp; But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do. &nbsp; I don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order. &nbsp; And I don’t know. &nbsp; I just think that they didn’t &nbsp; There was no like unity. &nbsp; They didn’t know what they were going in there for. &nbsp; So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. &nbsp; But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. &nbsp; So that’s what we created in turn in there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And &nbsp; Honestly, I don’t &nbsp; I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. &nbsp; I honestly think they’re always going to be like that. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I don’t &nbsp; I really don’t have anything else to say. &nbsp; It’s gone on definitely long enough. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we’re making enough progress. &nbsp; Like we’ve made progress, &nbsp; But not enough to stay in there. &nbsp; And I think no matter how long we stay in there, &nbsp; Once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. &nbsp; And we can’t stay over there forever. &nbsp; So I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. &nbsp; No. &nbsp; Ok"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon, in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to adapt. They've been grappling with their declining membership, and I believe it's because they're not very welcoming to a lot of contemporary views, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stances are quite conservative, and I think if they loosened up a bit, they'd retain more followers. I've heard plenty of folks steering away from the Church due to their rigid views on these topics. People these days don't align with their stance on these issues, so they're starting to turn their backs. For instance, if you're pro-choice, you might not want to be part of a community that deems abortion wrong. The same goes for those who support gay marriage. I can't see why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented the recent scandals. They might have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women in the priesthood, but it's hard to say for sure. I mean, aren't priests supposed to be devoted to their work and their families just like everyone else?",

            "Alright, so I spend the summer bustling in a hospital pharmacy. You know, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its uses. It's all about striking a balance. Sure, I'd say no to making it widely available to the public. No way. But for medicinal purposes? Absolutely, yes. It's about the benefits, not the stigma. Yeah, there are plenty of controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percoets, and we use them all the time because they're beneficial and effective. If you deny their worth just because there's a negative stigma around marijuana, that's a waste of time for me. You need to embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol, though both can be abused. It's a tough one. I'd suggest gradually integrating it, removing the taboo around it first, then letting it become legal. But if you just legalize it all at once, it'll likely be abused. You gotta remove that negative image of marijuana first, so people can use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",

            "I mean, initially, I was cool with the whole thing, but I think everyone was still pretty shook up from 9/11, and we kinda went into Iraq on a technicality. I mean, there were these pretexts that they used to get us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration was linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and they said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Spoiler alert: that was all made up.\n\nAnd that just rubbed me the wrong way. The Iraq War just makes me see red. I think the Bush administration flat-out lied to the American people, and they haven’t owned up to it yet. Not even Colin Powell, who presented all that evidence at the UN. Now he says he wasn’t convinced by it. That’s just incompetence, man. It’s an impeachable offense to lie like that. I think the Bush administration has been systematically disrespecting the Constitution since 9/11.\n\nThey came into office with war on their minds. I can't remember the Treasury Secretary's name, but he wrote about it in his book after he was kicked out. But it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad, and he was looking to boost our energy supply. Underhanded, if you ask me.\n\nBut anyway, I think it's gone on long enough. I don't think pulling out now would be a good idea, though. There's a risk the country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The alternative, like what the UN and the US are pushing for—getting countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and restore order—it's not guaranteed to work either. I mean, in the long run, Iraq's sovereignty could become a huge issue. The interim government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much. Prime Minister, who's it again? He doesn't seem to have much control. And we still have radical factions vying for power. It's a mess, man. I can't even articulate it nicely.",

If we stay, we'll have to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us. I don't know, it's hard. I don't know if we should continue the war. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. We don't need to use guns to show we're big and American. We just want to help, but it's a waste of resources. I feel bad for Bush, he's making a big mess. Like Vietnam, it was never a declared war. I don't think it's fair. The war is taking too long, and it's hurting us and them. It's a cycle of destruction. I don't want it to end because of the families involved. But I don't want to impose our culture on them. It's going to make things worse. I think this is going to go on for years. That's it. Ok.",
            "&nbsp;  i don't feel quite right about this.  it's not my place to make it legal or for a state to declare it as such  i believe it's up to the churches.  the constitution even spells it out: separation of church and state  i think trying to enforce it would be against what's already written in stone  and the people pushing for it, i think it's choosing one church's belief over another  most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few places like Boston  i don't think it's up to the government to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal or legal  &nbsp;  separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution and our religious tolerance here  and making an amendment about it would be wrong, contradicting what's already there  and it's one of the few amendments that could restrict people, not the government  so i don't feel it's right  &nbsp;  no, i don't think the federal government or any government should be involved.  it's his personal beliefs as a Catholic, pushing for this amendment  it's showing a preference for his religion over others  i think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official  and there's no reason behind it other than personal views  it might even boost society, i don't know how, but i think it could be better than not doing it  &nbsp;  um, i think i've said it all  &nbsp;",
            "Well,\nTo begin, I don't believe the government was fully honest with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. They tried to link the war to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, making it seem like Iraq was somehow involved, which wasn't truly the case.\n\nNow, I'm not for war, especially preemptive strikes. I think it's a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. The war in Iraq has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a quick, successful stay in Iraq. In reality, it's taken years, and American troops are still dying and training Iraqi forces. It's a complex situation, and the US government didn't plan for all possible outcomes. They made it seem easy, but implementing a new government takes time, as it did in our own country. I believe we should see it through, but at what cost?\n\nThe decision to go into Iraq was difficult, especially considering the large number of American casualties. Why, if the goal is to spread democracy, is it just Iraq? I think it's about oil and controlling resources. The whole weapons of mass destruction argument was unfounded, yet we've taken no action against countries like North Korea that actually have them.\n\nLet's hope it ends soon, but probably not.",

            "&nbsp; I feel like the war has stretched out too long\n&nbsp; Initially, I thought the purpose was noble\n&nbsp; To restore democracy in another country\n&nbsp; But I think we’ve lost sight of that\n&nbsp; Now it feels like we’re just at war to prove our power\n&nbsp; I suspect there were personal reasons\n&nbsp; George Bush’s father had issues with Saddam Hussein\n&nbsp; So if the original aim was to give democracy to a country lacking a fair system, that would be understandable\n&nbsp; But if personal matters were involved, it wouldn’t be fair\n&nbsp; I think we’ve outstayed our welcome\n&nbsp; Our initial purpose was clear in those first few months\n&nbsp; But the conflict has dragged on for years\n&nbsp; I believe our reasons have become muddled\n&nbsp; We seem to be at war just for the sake of it\n&nbsp; We don’t want to leave without a decisive win\n\n&nbsp; I think it’s gone on too long\n&nbsp; Our economy is being drained\n&nbsp; We should focus on our own issues\n&nbsp; Like poverty, infrastructure, healthcare\n&nbsp; We’re spending billions on a war that’s lost its cause\n&nbsp; It’s time to bring our troops home\n&nbsp; The country’s officials need to stand on their own",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nOh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOkay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. I mean, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile, and you might need to be their \"friend.\" But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. I mean, if I think that was actually good—someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost—that's tough. Because obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile or if someone was just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or if they were actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. I don't really know.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once about a man who just tried to prove how easily he could get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your looks sometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue. Because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard that my roommate's high school had an issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like, I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "So, um, we need to talk about the Iraq War one more time. Um, I feel a bit hypocritical discussing it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really crucial anymore. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit their mistake. And um, according to recent polls, seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Even eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of the troops there agree that it was a dumb move and we should pull out within the year. It's been a complete disaster since day one, and pulling out will be just as disastrous. There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. Um, I think it's just a cultural clash between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. The administration thinks they can impose democracy on a people who would never choose it that way. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like quicksand. Um, I don't know what to say about it. I just don't see a reason for us to stay there. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons to stay. I guess I wouldn't mind a gradual pullout over a year or so, but I don't see why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year. And, you know, these are the people we're trying to help. Telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if things go to shit. Um, and at least then, if we decide to help out later, we'd be the good guys. Not really, though, because we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we are now. Um, yeah. Uh, no.",
            "You know, I'm quite convinced that gender discrimination is still a prevalent issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women; it also affects men in certain fields. In general, women face significant hurdles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even when they're qualified for a position, they might not get promoted because historically, women haven't been seen in upper management roles. The situation isn't much different for men either. Take, for instance, the fashion industry. Men aren't taken as seriously, especially if they're straight, because they don't fit the typical male stereotype and might not understand the 'female perspective.' And then there are men who stay at home to raise their children. Society often disapproves of this, viewing it as unmasculine. It's a difficult situation because while these men might prefer to spend time with their children, society often expects men to be the breadwinners. The pace of change is slow, but it's happening. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are becoming accepted. However, it's crucial to promote these changes subtly, letting their positive qualities shine through. Pushing too hard can lead to resistance. We've come a long way, and change takes time. But there's also discrimination based on class, where someone from a rural background might face judgment for their grammar. And sometimes, gender discrimination can be mutual, with men or women looking down on each other. It's a complex issue, and it's not just about gender anymore.",
            "Let me clarify: they didn't legalize it, they decriminalized it. This means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic citation. You'd get a ticket rather than being arrested and booked. And while decriminalizing it mitigates the worst consequences in job interviews or other areas, it doesn't erase the potential future ramifications. However, there's an argument that it saves a lot of money for municipalities on arrests, court cases, and public defenders. It also opens up funds for social programs and public education. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's fine. But out in the open, it's still quite awkward due to society's taboo. I'm not sure about making it like cigarettes, sold everywhere, and smoked while driving. I believe marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyles than decision-making skills, but it's tough to generalize as reactions vary greatly. Both alcohol and marijuana have their effects, but no two people react the same way. It's hard to say whether one is worse than the other.",
            "I would indeed say yes, um, a lot of the things they do are quite traditional, like they've been doing them for ages. It's good to be grounded in tradition, but it's also crucial to be adaptable to change, you know? Um, a lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church every week, and they're quite strict on how things should be done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and it's not very accepting of those who aren't perfect Catholics, or those of other religions. For instance, my mom was Episcopalian, and my dad was Catholic, but they wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of his religion. It's not really about being tolerant of other religions, you know? We always learned to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. A lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do one thing, but the practice often goes against it because it's so outdated. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, like, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily stop them from pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? I mean, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's about children, not spouses. So, if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent those things from happening, I think it would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter. I can’t say for sure who’s right or wrong. But I do think this is the trickiest issue we're facing today. It's like trying to separate the church from the state without offending anyone. And how to define marriage? It’s a tricky business. I mean, if civil unions are just a matter of two people getting together, why can’t the government see it that way? After all, people don’t get tax breaks or any specific treatment if they’re baptized. So, if you’re married, why shouldn’t the government see it as a civil union? That’s what it is – two people united. And gay marriage? Well, if that’s what they have, it’s just another civil union. But if all states can agree on something, then they should push for it to become federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Ridiculous. It’s not a big enough cause to amend the constitution. It’s not important enough. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I have several gay friends, and while I might not condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue, but one that each state should decide on their own terms. After all, there are red states and blue states; naturally, democratic ones are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect its decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be left to the discretion of each state. The president shouldn't dictate the whole country's stance on this matter. I'm not a fan of Bush's ban on gay marriage, and I don't think he has the right to decide how each state should run itself. He won't be in office forever, so why should his term dictate nationwide policy? It's up to each state to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "Well, you see, it's a public space, like Myspace. It's basically a bulletin board for the world to see, not just your friends or your classmates. And if you post something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. School officials can see it, even if it's not under their name, because they have access to it at home too.\n\nNow, when it comes to something like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine for them to monitor it. It's their responsibility to keep the students safe, and if it saves lives, then I think they have the right to do it. But if they're just cruising around looking for students to get into trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. It's not just about what they post, but what they do with that information.\n\nExpressing yourself is a lot easier when you're writing, but it's a public thing. You can't just post something and expect it to be private. Everything you post can come back to haunt you, like emails. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back, and it can get you into trouble.\n\nAs for me, I don't think they should be on the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that could make the school safer, that's fine. It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe place. Teachers and officials have to ensure that, especially with all the drills and lock downs due to terrorism threats. They're just trying to make the school a safer place, like preventing another Columbine.\n\nSo, that's basically it.",
            "&nbsp; Ok &nbsp; Um &nbsp; The war &nbsp; Um &nbsp; At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. &nbsp; I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I do think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. &nbsp; And we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I really think that it backfired on us. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I uh &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; I was all for it, &nbsp; but now I’m very against it. &nbsp; I don’t think it did anything. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. &nbsp; Like I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re if they can’t even get along with themselves. &nbsp; So um &nbsp; Like unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; With those people. &nbsp; I just don’t care. &nbsp; I just think &nbsp; I don’t think that &nbsp; Sometimes I don’t think they’re human. &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; Like they fight with each other and they can’t. &nbsp; They just can’t do anything themselves. &nbsp; So I really don’t care. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; We definitely went over there just unprepared. &nbsp; We didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. &nbsp; They’re just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. &nbsp; I just think they’re looking to get us out of there. &nbsp; And I think that should be fine for us. &nbsp; I think we should just leave and that’s really it. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; We just &nbsp; I think we were just more like &nbsp; Just hyped up than anything. &nbsp; I don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. &nbsp;Um &nbsp; And I just &nbsp; We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; Also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; But at the time, I see where he was coming from. &nbsp; We really &nbsp; I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say \"ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\". &nbsp; So &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we could have let it go. &nbsp; But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do. &nbsp; I don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order. &nbsp; And I don’t know. &nbsp; I just think that they didn’t &nbsp; There was no like unity. &nbsp; They didn’t know what they were going in there for. &nbsp; So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. &nbsp; But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. &nbsp; So that’s what we created in turn in there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And &nbsp; Honestly, I don’t &nbsp; I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. &nbsp; I honestly think they’re always going to be like that. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I don’t &nbsp; I really don’t have anything else to say. &nbsp; It’s gone on definitely long enough. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we’re making enough progress. &nbsp; Like we’ve made progress, &nbsp; But not enough to stay in there. &nbsp; And I think no matter how long we stay in there, &nbsp; Once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. &nbsp; And we can’t stay over there forever. &nbsp; So I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. &nbsp; No. &nbsp; Ok"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "Alright, so there are a few points where I think the Catholic Church needs to shift. I've heard they're losing some of their flock because they're not so accepting of various views. Take, for instance, issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stance on these is quite steadfast, which is fine, but it seems a bit outdated. If they could adopt a more contemporary viewpoint, they might not have to worry about dwindling attendance. I've noticed some people are starting to veer away from the Church due to their perspectives on these issues. It's like, if you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a denomination where that's considered wrong. The same goes for LGBTQ+ rights—if you strongly believe in them, you might not want to be part of a faith that doesn't agree. I don't see why female priests or married priests should be an issue, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented past scandals. Maybe they would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests, but it's hard to tell. I mean, it's not like priests are married to their work and nothing else—everyone's got a family life and other commitments. So why can't priests have that too?",
            "I'm not inherently opposed to same-sex marriage. Whether people are born gay or come to it later, I don't believe it's a choice or something they can consciously decide. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can't marry, but two people of the same sex can't either. It seems like they don't have a choice in who they are attracted to, just as I didn't choose to be straight. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who they are, and I don't think they should be punished or put on a stage for it. I don't think the government has any right to interject in people's personal lives. It's just how they're born, and it doesn't affect the security of our country. It's just them being themselves, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Honestly, there isn't a compelling reason not to. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's so much more complex than that. There are so many facets to it that it can't be equated to heterosexual relationships. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; heads and tails are not one and the same. Yet, in many respects, they are the same. Civil rights such as property taxes and healthcare are affected. A partner in a gay relationship can't be in the room with you if you're sick, can't visit you, because they're not technically considered family. That's absurd if you're spending the rest of your life together. Numerous scientific studies show that homosexual couples enjoy the same level of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, the same thing. The issue often lies in the fact that homosexuals aren't asking to marry in a church, but for a legal document from the government. If it's not about church or state, it shouldn't be an issue. I struggle to understand why people like Catholics can get hung up on it being against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriages? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They're the same in many ways - relationship roles played by different partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, children's adjustments, and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. But it's a new concept, hard to quantify. The main concern is how children are treated by peers and society. In New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and protests. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. They can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state. An amendment reversing the status quo is in order. President Bush has strong views on this, aligning with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. His reasons are mostly moral, but morality varies. It's unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It's hypocritical for the government to ban gay marriage while facing recent controversies like the \"under god\" pledge. Many are anti-gay because they believe homosexuals are psychologically damaged due to trauma or personality defects. The American Psychological Association debunks this, advising people to listen to actual research and institutions, not just neighbors and friends' opinions.",
            "So, well, I've been slinging pills at a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I gotta tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's all bad news. Take, for instance, oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are all controlled substances, but they've got their uses. I'd say keep them around for medicinal purposes. But just because something's illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. You get my drift? There are plenty of drugs that are illegal but have their place in medicine. Why should marijuana be any different? I think the taboo around it is holding us back, you know? It's not like heroine or cocaine—it's not all bad. We just need to remove that stigma and let people use it responsibly, maybe even medicinally. But maybe not all at once, we gotta ease into it. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, but both can be misused if you let them. Just gotta change the image of marijuana first, and then people might see it for what it can be.",
            "Um\nI reckon the church has kinda adapted to the twenty-first century already\nUm\nNot as strict as it used to be\nI recall growing up, I'd always go to church every Sunday\nAnd\nI'd have these cute little dresses\nAnd\nMatching shoes\nAnd\nA matching purse\nBack then, I went to a private school\nAnd\nI'd see all my friends there on the weekends\nAnd\nWe'd just go\nBut\nNow, they've got this youth mass\nAnd\nThey cut it down to thirty minutes\nPeople are a lot more casual\nEspecially during the summer, you'd see people in beach clothes, straight from the beach\nAnd\nFamilies running in late\nSo yeah, it's become more chill\nEven at the morning masses where I used to get all dressed up\nPeople wear jeans and khakis now\nI mean, khakis are nice but\nA lot more casual\nAs for other things\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed\nLike\nThat's the church I know\nI don't know the politics, but\nYeah\nThat's it\n[OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or priests to marry?]\nUm\nI think these things couldn't have been avoided\nBecause\nThere are married men who still become pedophiles\nAnd\nThey still have an attraction towards young kids\nSo\nI think it's not about the marriage thing\nUm\nIt's more about the person\nUm\nThey choose to become a priest\nUm\nThere are religions where they're allowed to marry, like on Seventh Heaven\nI don't know if he's a reverend or a minister or something\nBut\nThey're allowed to marry\nSo\nI know it's different\nBut\nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and get married, they should maybe think about a different faith\n[OK, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm\nAbout which part?\n[Um]\nJust the changing ways\n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess]\nOh, on the pedophilia\n[Mm hmm]\nUm\nI think, like, the whole sexuality thing\nUm\nI think it's mostly genetics\nI don't think people just become it\nI think they're born that way\nI don't think it has much to do with how they're brought up\nIt might have a little more to do in this case\nBut\nI think it's their genetics\nAnd\nYou can't really hide that through marriage\nYou could try\nBut\nThen it usually comes out\nSo\nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening\nUm\nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them\nBut\nI don't think in all cases they knew\n[OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUm, no",
            "Haha\nInitially, I was alright with the concept, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we kind of stumbled into Iraq with some flimsy excuses.\nThe Bush administration tried to link Iraq to bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, all of which turned out to be false. That really set my teeth on edge, and the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just sheer malfeasance of office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th are astounding. It seems like they came into office with a war in mind.\nI can't recall the name of the treasury secretary who made this claim in his book after being forced out, but it appears that Bush Jr. was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein and maybe to increase our energy supply, all underhanded and dishonest. It's gone on long enough, but a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths. The UN and US are now considering a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that might not be ideal either, as it could cause long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The Interim government is crumbling, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister's grip on the political process is weak, and radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party holds significant influence. It's a mess, and I can't articulate my thoughts in polite company.",
            "Alright then, let's dive into this. You want to talk about the Iraq War, huh? Not sure I'm the best person for this. I mean, it's not like I have a degree in political science or anything. But, alright, let me give it a shot.\n\nMmm, okay, so what I feel about the whole Iraq War thing is that it's just kind of pointless. I mean, it's not like it was a proper war, you know? It was more like a bit of revenge for 9/11. They figured it was Iraq that did the attacks, so we went and got back at them. But, I mean, I'm not really into the whole war thing, so I don't keep up with all the details.\n\nBut what I do know is that we're over there trying to build some sort of democracy, right? And maybe we're after their oil too? But, you know, it's not really worth it. It's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and build this democracy, which is gonna take forever. And if we leave, they'll be pissed at us for messing everything up and they'll have to start over. It's a real mess.\n\nYou know, this is hard. I don't really know much about it. I just feel bad for George Bush because it's making him look like one of the worst presidents ever. It's like the Vietnam War all over again. It's like, why are we still there? We didn't even declare it a war, you know? We just went and did it.\n\nI mean, I don't think it's a real war anymore. I feel like we're just over there to show off our big guns and stuff. But I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it's not really a war, you know? It's just a big mess.\n\nBut then again, I feel bad for the families of the soldiers over there. It's not fair to them. They've got lives too, you know? And now their kids don't have a safe place to go to school. And all those different groups are just killing each other because of their beliefs.\n\nBut, if we stay, we're just gonna make things worse. We'll be trying to mold them into some sort of second United States, and it'll just make Al-Qaeda even worse. I don't think it's gonna end anytime soon. It's just gonna go on and on.\n\nThat's about it, I guess. It's a real confusing situation.",
            "Well, honestly, I think it's a bit much to try and make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I mean, it's all about respecting the constitution's clear separation of church and state. It's right there, as clear as day, and I believe that attempting to impose any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of our constitutional principles. So, I'm not convinced that it's up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to declare illegal or legal. I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, and I believe that this is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government. Separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our constitution, and any amendment trying to restrict it would be wrong and contradictory to our founding principles. I don't see why the federal government should be involved anyway. It seems like this is just a push from a Catholic perspective, and I don't see how it will impact the economy or society. If anything, it might have a positive impact. I've said my piece, I think.",

I don't think the government was fully honest with the American people about the war's reason\nBefore invading Iraq, they attempted to connect the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but in reality, they weren't that linked\nThe government played on our emotions after the 9/11 attacks\nThe war began in 2003\nMe, I'm pretty much against war, especially preemptive strikes\nI think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the Vietnam War\nThe government should have learned from their past mistakes\nA ton of American soldiers died\nThey were removing the government and I don't think the American government was ready for what was to come\nThey removed the Iraqi government and tried to impose democracy, like they did in Vietnam to remove Communists\nThe government should have known it would be a long, tough process, not an easy victory\nWe're still there, almost 2006, and we're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces\nI think the government wasn't prepared and they tried to deceive us into thinking it would be a short, successful stay\nI mean, it's not easy to implement a new government and democracy was a struggle in our own country too\nI think the government made it seem like an easy task\nSo, the war in Iraq\nIt's a tough call\nI was thinking about the presidential election in 2004\nOne of my reasons for considering Bush was to finish what started, but now it's hard to leave after being there so long and having taken away their government\nWe can't just abandon them\nBut then there's the issue of the countless American casualties\nHow much more are we willing to risk for a democratic Iraq?\nGoing back to the reason for invading Iraq, why just Iraq?\nWhy not other countries?\nI think it's about oil, controlling resources\nAnd before the war, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found\nMeanwhile, places like North Korea, with known weapons, get a pass\nI don't think the government is being thorough or truthful enough with their decisions\nI just hope it ends soon, but probably not",

I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much for everyone to see, right? Myspace, for instance, you have to be a member to see someone's profile, and you usually need to be their friend. But if you accept them, then you're giving them permission to see it.

            "You know, I do believe that gender discrimination is still very much an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It really depends on the particular field of work you're in. For instance, women often face a glass ceiling where, despite their qualifications, they may not get promoted because historically women haven't been in the upper echelons of the business world. And it's not just men who face this issue. Fatherhood at home is often frowned upon by society, which expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men are often not taken seriously, especially if they're straight, because of societal expectations about gender roles. So, depending on the field, gender discrimination is definitely a reality.\n\nChanging these perceptions is slow because society has deeply ingrained mindsets. While we've made progress from the 1800s, change takes time. Women rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs is a step forward, and men staying at home is becoming more accepted. But it's a slow process, and we have to continue working at it. Promoting the positive qualities of those who are stereotypically discriminated against can help, but we can't force change too quickly or people will resist. We need to be patient and let societal attitudes evolve naturally.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't just about gender. It can also be about one's background. If you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't perfect, but you're intelligent and work your way up to a CEO position, other men might judge you harshly. So, it's not just about gender but also about where you come from and how you fit into society's expectations.",
            "I guess they didn't make it legal, they just moved it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, like a traffic ticket. If you get caught, you'll get cited, but no jail time. But, job interviews might still be tough. Decriminalizing it doesn't erase past convictions, but it saves money. Arresting, booking, and housing people costs a lot, and so does the court process. Many communities won't decriminalize it due to drug policies and finances. However, in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's a non-issue, and the savings go to education, social programs, and food assistance. I'm not saying it should be everywhere, but the financial aspect is compelling. It shouldn't be like cigarettes, sold everywhere and smoked in public. It's still taboo in many places.

You don't believe it should be a national issue, and you'd prefer each state make its own decision. After all, it's not like the president lives in every state and should make decisions for the entire country. Most states are democratic or republican, and it makes sense that democratic states would push for gay marriage. If you live in a state that's democratic, you should respect that decision, as you chose to live there. It's not like you're from every single state, and Bush shouldn't get to decide how each one operates. He's just gonna be out of office in a couple of years. It's best to leave decisions like this up to individual states, as they're the ones who'll be dealing with the consequences. Plus, if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban, it'll just be back and forth. So, let's leave it to the states, alright?",
            "Now look, I don't really care\nI mean, school shootings are serious business\nYou know, when you're talking about kids' lives on the line, it's sorta important to keep an eye on things\nAnd if that means checking up on what students are doing on the internet, well, I get it\nI mean, it's a public space, right?\nSo if a kid is putting stuff out there that could get them in trouble, yeah, school officials have every right to check it out\nIt's not like they're just snooping for no reason\nThey're doing it to keep the school safe, you know?\nBut if they're just going on there to catch students in the act of doing something wrong, that's where it gets a bit shady\nIt starts feeling like an invasion of privacy\nBut if they're trying to stop something bad from happening, like a school shooting or something, well, that's a different story\nThey're just doing their job, making sure the school is a safer place\nAnd you know, it's a public thing, posting on the internet, so if you're not expecting to get in trouble, that's on you\nYou can't really complain about someone seeing what you've put out there\nAnd it's not just about posting on the internet\nIt's about the whole concept of privacy\nLike, if you send an email to someone and it gets lost or ends up in the wrong hands, it's out there forever\nYou can't take it back\nAnd if you don't watch what you say, it can come back to haunt you\nLike, one day you might end up being some big shot and then someone finds that old email you sent when you were a college student\nIt's a big world out there, and nothing really stays hidden for long\nSo if school officials are trying to keep the students safe, well, good for them\nAs long as they're not just doing it to catch someone in the act of doing something wrong\nThey're just doing their job, making sure the school is a safer place for everyone\nAnd I mean, who likes having those kinds of surprises come back to haunt you, right?",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nInitially, I was all for it. The events of nine eleven had a profound personal impact on me.\nUm\nAt first, I was all for going there and causing as much disruption as they did to us.\nUm\nI believe that, due to the emotional nature of the event, we overlooked many things and didn't consider the long-term implications.\nAnd we went over there unprepared, without a well-thought-out plan.\nUm\nI really think it backfired on us.\nUm\nI don’t know\nI was all for it initially,\nBut now I’m very against it.\nI don’t think it has achieved anything.\nUm\nI think the people over there,\nAs long as they’re fighting among themselves, they can’t fight against us too.\nLike, I don’t think our presence over there will help if they can’t even get along.\nSo um\nLike, unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone one definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Alright, so there are a few points where I think the Catholic Church needs to shift. I've heard they're losing some of their flock because they're not so accepting of various views. Take, for instance, issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stance on these is quite steadfast, which is fine, but it seems a bit outdated. If they could adopt a more contemporary viewpoint, they might not have to worry about dwindling attendance. I've noticed some people are starting to veer away from the Church due to their perspectives on these issues. It's like, if you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a denomination where that's considered wrong. The same goes for LGBTQ+ rights—if you strongly believe in them, you might not want to be part of a faith that doesn't agree. I don't see why female priests or married priests should be an issue, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented past scandals. Maybe they would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests, but it's hard to tell. I mean, it's not like priests are married to their work and nothing else—everyone's got a family life and other commitments. So why can't priests have that too?",
            "I'm not inherently opposed to same-sex marriage. Whether people are born gay or come to it later, I don't believe it's a choice or something they can consciously decide. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can't marry, but two people of the same sex can't either. It seems like they don't have a choice in who they are attracted to, just as I didn't choose to be straight. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who they are, and I don't think they should be punished or put on a stage for it. I don't think the government has any right to interject in people's personal lives. It's just how they're born, and it doesn't affect the security of our country. It's just them being themselves, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Honestly, there isn't a compelling reason not to. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's so much more complex than that. There are so many facets to it that it can't be equated to heterosexual relationships. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; heads and tails are not one and the same. Yet, in many respects, they are the same. Civil rights such as property taxes and healthcare are affected. A partner in a gay relationship can't be in the room with you if you're sick, can't visit you, because they're not technically considered family. That's absurd if you're spending the rest of your life together. Numerous scientific studies show that homosexual couples enjoy the same level of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, the same thing. The issue often lies in the fact that homosexuals aren't asking to marry in a church, but for a legal document from the government. If it's not about church or state, it shouldn't be an issue. I struggle to understand why people like Catholics can get hung up on it being against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriages? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They're the same in many ways - relationship roles played by different partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, children's adjustments, and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. But it's a new concept, hard to quantify. The main concern is how children are treated by peers and society. In New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and protests. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. They can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state. An amendment reversing the status quo is in order. President Bush has strong views on this, aligning with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. His reasons are mostly moral, but morality varies. It's unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It's hypocritical for the government to ban gay marriage while facing recent controversies like the \"under god\" pledge. Many are anti-gay because they believe homosexuals are psychologically damaged due to trauma or personality defects. The American Psychological Association debunks this, advising people to listen to actual research and institutions, not just neighbors and friends' opinions.",
            "So, well, I've been slinging pills at a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I gotta tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's all bad news. Take, for instance, oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are all controlled substances, but they've got their uses. I'd say keep them around for medicinal purposes. But just because something's illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. You get my drift? There are plenty of drugs that are illegal but have their place in medicine. Why should marijuana be any different? I think the taboo around it is holding us back, you know? It's not like heroine or cocaine—it's not all bad. We just need to remove that stigma and let people use it responsibly, maybe even medicinally. But maybe not all at once, we gotta ease into it. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, but both can be misused if you let them. Just gotta change the image of marijuana first, and then people might see it for what it can be.",
            "Um\nI reckon the church has kinda adapted to the twenty-first century already\nUm\nNot as strict as it used to be\nI recall growing up, I'd always go to church every Sunday\nAnd\nI'd have these cute little dresses\nAnd\nMatching shoes\nAnd\nA matching purse\nBack then, I went to a private school\nAnd\nI'd see all my friends there on the weekends\nAnd\nWe'd just go\nBut\nNow, they've got this youth mass\nAnd\nThey cut it down to thirty minutes\nPeople are a lot more casual\nEspecially during the summer, you'd see people in beach clothes, straight from the beach\nAnd\nFamilies running in late\nSo yeah, it's become more chill\nEven at the morning masses where I used to get all dressed up\nPeople wear jeans and khakis now\nI mean, khakis are nice but\nA lot more casual\nAs for other things\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed\nLike\nThat's the church I know\nI don't know the politics, but\nYeah\nThat's it\n[OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or priests to marry?]\nUm\nI think these things couldn't have been avoided\nBecause\nThere are married men who still become pedophiles\nAnd\nThey still have an attraction towards young kids\nSo\nI think it's not about the marriage thing\nUm\nIt's more about the person\nUm\nThey choose to become a priest\nUm\nThere are religions where they're allowed to marry, like on Seventh Heaven\nI don't know if he's a reverend or a minister or something\nBut\nThey're allowed to marry\nSo\nI know it's different\nBut\nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and get married, they should maybe think about a different faith\n[OK, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm\nAbout which part?\n[Um]\nJust the changing ways\n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess]\nOh, on the pedophilia\n[Mm hmm]\nUm\nI think, like, the whole sexuality thing\nUm\nI think it's mostly genetics\nI don't think people just become it\nI think they're born that way\nI don't think it has much to do with how they're brought up\nIt might have a little more to do in this case\nBut\nI think it's their genetics\nAnd\nYou can't really hide that through marriage\nYou could try\nBut\nThen it usually comes out\nSo\nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening\nUm\nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them\nBut\nI don't think in all cases they knew\n[OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUm, no",
            "Haha\nInitially, I was alright with the concept, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we kind of stumbled into Iraq with some flimsy excuses.\nThe Bush administration tried to link Iraq to bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, all of which turned out to be false. That really set my teeth on edge, and the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just sheer malfeasance of office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th are astounding. It seems like they came into office with a war in mind.\nI can't recall the name of the treasury secretary who made this claim in his book after being forced out, but it appears that Bush Jr. was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein and maybe to increase our energy supply, all underhanded and dishonest. It's gone on long enough, but a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths. The UN and US are now considering a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that might not be ideal either, as it could cause long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The Interim government is crumbling, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister's grip on the political process is weak, and radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party holds significant influence. It's a mess, and I can't articulate my thoughts in polite company.",
            "Alright then, let's dive into this. You want to talk about the Iraq War, huh? Not sure I'm the best person for this. I mean, it's not like I have a degree in political science or anything. But, alright, let me give it a shot.\n\nMmm, okay, so what I feel about the whole Iraq War thing is that it's just kind of pointless. I mean, it's not like it was a proper war, you know? It was more like a bit of revenge for 9/11. They figured it was Iraq that did the attacks, so we went and got back at them. But, I mean, I'm not really into the whole war thing, so I don't keep up with all the details.\n\nBut what I do know is that we're over there trying to build some sort of democracy, right? And maybe we're after their oil too? But, you know, it's not really worth it. It's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and build this democracy, which is gonna take forever. And if we leave, they'll be pissed at us for messing everything up and they'll have to start over. It's a real mess.\n\nYou know, this is hard. I don't really know much about it. I just feel bad for George Bush because it's making him look like one of the worst presidents ever. It's like the Vietnam War all over again. It's like, why are we still there? We didn't even declare it a war, you know? We just went and did it.\n\nI mean, I don't think it's a real war anymore. I feel like we're just over there to show off our big guns and stuff. But I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it's not really a war, you know? It's just a big mess.\n\nBut then again, I feel bad for the families of the soldiers over there. It's not fair to them. They've got lives too, you know? And now their kids don't have a safe place to go to school. And all those different groups are just killing each other because of their beliefs.\n\nBut, if we stay, we're just gonna make things worse. We'll be trying to mold them into some sort of second United States, and it'll just make Al-Qaeda even worse. I don't think it's gonna end anytime soon. It's just gonna go on and on.\n\nThat's about it, I guess. It's a real confusing situation.",
            "Well, honestly, I think it's a bit much to try and make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I mean, it's all about respecting the constitution's clear separation of church and state. It's right there, as clear as day, and I believe that attempting to impose any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of our constitutional principles. So, I'm not convinced that it's up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to declare illegal or legal. I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, and I believe that this is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government. Separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our constitution, and any amendment trying to restrict it would be wrong and contradictory to our founding principles. I don't see why the federal government should be involved anyway. It seems like this is just a push from a Catholic perspective, and I don't see how it will impact the economy or society. If anything, it might have a positive impact. I've said my piece, I think.",

            "Can I ask a quick question? I'm not sure, but I feel like something was prevented because someone went online and found something. I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much for everyone to see, right? Myspace, for instance, you have to be a member to see someone's profile, and you usually need to be their friend. But if you accept them, then you're giving them permission to see it. So, anytime you put something online, you know a lot of people are going to see it. If someone saw something and prevented a life from being lost, that's a tough situation. I mean, I can't imagine just one person watching everyone's profiles all the time. But if it was for research or something, maybe that's different. I don't really know. I don't have a Myspace, but I do have Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there seeing my stuff. I heard a story about a guy who found someone's screen name and started talking to them. I personally wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who know my screen name even though I don't recognize them. It's weird because they can see my interests, my class schedule, and my friends. It's a tricky issue because I want to communicate with my friends, but I also want to protect my privacy. It's hard to balance. I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can look at what, so...",

            "You know, I do believe that gender discrimination is still very much an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It really depends on the particular field of work you're in. For instance, women often face a glass ceiling where, despite their qualifications, they may not get promoted because historically women haven't been in the upper echelons of the business world. And it's not just men who face this issue. Fatherhood at home is often frowned upon by society, which expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men are often not taken seriously, especially if they're straight, because of societal expectations about gender roles. So, depending on the field, gender discrimination is definitely a reality.\n\nChanging these perceptions is slow because society has deeply ingrained mindsets. While we've made progress from the 1800s, change takes time. Women rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs is a step forward, and men staying at home is becoming more accepted. But it's a slow process, and we have to continue working at it. Promoting the positive qualities of those who are stereotypically discriminated against can help, but we can't force change too quickly or people will resist. We need to be patient and let societal attitudes evolve naturally.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't just about gender. It can also be about one's background. If you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't perfect, but you're intelligent and work your way up to a CEO position, other men might judge you harshly. So, it's not just about gender but also about where you come from and how you fit into society's expectations.",
            "I guess they didn't make it legal, they just moved it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, like a traffic ticket. If you get caught, you'll get cited, but no jail time. But, job interviews might still be tough. Decriminalizing it doesn't erase past convictions, but it saves money. Arresting, booking, and housing people costs a lot, and so does the court process. Many communities won't decriminalize it due to drug policies and finances. However, in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's a non-issue, and the savings go to education, social programs, and food assistance. I'm not saying it should be everywhere, but the financial aspect is compelling. It shouldn't be like cigarettes, sold everywhere and smoked in public. It's still taboo in many places. Both alcohol and marijuana have adverse effects, but people react differently. Some handle it better than others. But they're both harmful, and it's hard to generalize.",
            "Well, I'd say yes\nBecause\nUm\nA lot of their ways are very traditional  ya know?\nLike they've done things the same way for ages\nAnd\nIt’s good to hold onto the old ways\nBut\nYou gotta be open to change too\nUm\nI reckon\nA lot of Catholics are stringent about attending church weekly\nAnd\nUm\nThey’ve got strict rules on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes  I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the rules to the letter\nAnd\nUm\nThey don't embrace others who aren't spotless Catholics\nAnd\nUm\nLike\nTake my parents for instance\nMy dad was Episcopal, my mom a Catholic\nAnd they weren’t married in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s faith\n\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s not really\nLike\nShowing tolerance to other religions\nUm\nWe were always taught to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic thing\nBut\nIt’s kinda hypocritical to preach love while not accepting others\nIn that way\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do certain things\nBut the actual practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would change it\nI mean\nI think it'd be wise to let priests marry\nBut\nUm\nI don’t think that’d stop them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nIt’s just a different plane of existence\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that’d be a problem\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest kids\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a kid which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re gonna do something like that\nYou’re probably gonna do it whether you’re married or not\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to marry would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think it’d happen regardless",
            "I've gotta be honest, I'm still undecided on this. It's a tricky topic, as you know, not far from the separation of church and state and how we define marriage. I can't definitively say who's right or wrong here, but I think we're treading on delicate ground.\n\nI mean, if all states can agree on a reasonable stance, then they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That's just absurd. Our constitution shouldn't be amended for something this divisive, even if it's important to some. It's just not big enough to warrant changing the constitution, especially to outlaw something as fundamental as marriage.",
            "You were raised in a Christian household, so this whole thing with homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for you. You have many gay friends and you understand that it's a lifestyle you might not personally agree with, but you do think it should be legalized. You don't believe it should be a national issue, and you'd prefer each state make its own decision. After all, it's not like the president lives in every state and should make decisions for the entire country. Most states are democratic or republican, and it makes sense that democratic states would push for gay marriage. If you live in a state that's democratic, you should respect that decision, as you chose to live there. It's not like you're from every single state, and Bush shouldn't get to decide how each one operates. He's just gonna be out of office in a couple of years. It's best to leave decisions like this up to individual states, as they're the ones who'll be dealing with the consequences. Plus, if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban, it'll just be back and forth. So, let's leave it to the states, alright?",
            "Now look, I don't really care\nI mean, school shootings are serious business\nYou know, when you're talking about kids' lives on the line, it's sorta important to keep an eye on things\nAnd if that means checking up on what students are doing on the internet, well, I get it\nI mean, it's a public space, right?\nSo if a kid is putting stuff out there that could get them in trouble, yeah, school officials have every right to check it out\nIt's not like they're just snooping for no reason\nThey're doing it to keep the school safe, you know?\nBut if they're just going on there to catch students in the act of doing something wrong, that's where it gets a bit shady\nIt starts feeling like an invasion of privacy\nBut if they're trying to stop something bad from happening, like a school shooting or something, well, that's a different story\nThey're just doing their job, making sure the school is a safer place\nAnd you know, it's a public thing, posting on the internet, so if you're not expecting to get in trouble, that's on you\nYou can't really complain about someone seeing what you've put out there\nAnd it's not just about posting on the internet\nIt's about the whole concept of privacy\nLike, if you send an email to someone and it gets lost or ends up in the wrong hands, it's out there forever\nYou can't take it back\nAnd if you don't watch what you say, it can come back to haunt you\nLike, one day you might end up being some big shot and then someone finds that old email you sent when you were a college student\nIt's a big world out there, and nothing really stays hidden for long\nSo if school officials are trying to keep the students safe, well, good for them\nAs long as they're not just doing it to catch someone in the act of doing something wrong\nThey're just doing their job, making sure the school is a safer place for everyone\nAnd I mean, who likes having those kinds of surprises come back to haunt you, right?",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "Alright, so there are a few points where I think the Catholic Church needs to shift. I've heard they're losing some of their flock because they're not so accepting of various views. Take, for instance, issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stance on these is quite steadfast, which is fine, but it seems a bit outdated. If they could adopt a more contemporary viewpoint, they might not have to worry about dwindling attendance. I've noticed some people are starting to veer away from the Church due to their perspectives on these issues. It's like, if you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a denomination where that's considered wrong. The same goes for LGBTQ+ rights—if you strongly believe in them, you might not want to be part of a faith that doesn't agree. I don't see why female priests or married priests should be an issue, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented past scandals. Maybe they would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests, but it's hard to tell. I mean, it's not like priests are married to their work and nothing else—everyone's got a family life and other commitments. So why can't priests have that too?",
            "I'm not inherently opposed to same-sex marriage. Whether people are born gay or come to it later, I don't believe it's a choice or something they can consciously decide. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can't marry, but two people of the same sex can't either. It seems like they don't have a choice in who they are attracted to, just as I didn't choose to be straight. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who they are, and I don't think they should be punished or put on a stage for it. I don't think the government has any right to interject in people's personal lives. It's just how they're born, and it doesn't affect the security of our country. It's just them being themselves, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Honestly, there isn't a compelling reason not to. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's so much more complex than that. There are so many facets to it that it can't be equated to heterosexual relationships. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; heads and tails are not one and the same. Yet, in many respects, they are the same. Civil rights such as property taxes and healthcare are affected. A partner in a gay relationship can't be in the room with you if you're sick, can't visit you, because they're not technically considered family. That's absurd if you're spending the rest of your life together. Numerous scientific studies show that homosexual couples enjoy the same level of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, the same thing. The issue often lies in the fact that homosexuals aren't asking to marry in a church, but for a legal document from the government. If it's not about church or state, it shouldn't be an issue. I struggle to understand why people like Catholics can get hung up on it being against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriages? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They're the same in many ways - relationship roles played by different partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, children's adjustments, and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. But it's a new concept, hard to quantify. The main concern is how children are treated by peers and society. In New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and protests. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. They can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state. An amendment reversing the status quo is in order. President Bush has strong views on this, aligning with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. His reasons are mostly moral, but morality varies. It's unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It's hypocritical for the government to ban gay marriage while facing recent controversies like the \"under god\" pledge. Many are anti-gay because they believe homosexuals are psychologically damaged due to trauma or personality defects. The American Psychological Association debunks this, advising people to listen to actual research and institutions, not just neighbors and friends' opinions.",
            "So, well, I've been slinging pills at a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I gotta tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's all bad news. Take, for instance, oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are all controlled substances, but they've got their uses. I'd say keep them around for medicinal purposes. But just because something's illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. You get my drift? There are plenty of drugs that are illegal but have their place in medicine. Why should marijuana be any different? I think the taboo around it is holding us back, you know? It's not like heroine or cocaine—it's not all bad. We just need to remove that stigma and let people use it responsibly, maybe even medicinally. But maybe not all at once, we gotta ease into it. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, but both can be misused if you let them. Just gotta change the image of marijuana first, and then people might see it for what it can be.",
            "Um\nI reckon the church has kinda adapted to the twenty-first century already\nUm\nNot as strict as it used to be\nI recall growing up, I'd always go to church every Sunday\nAnd\nI'd have these cute little dresses\nAnd\nMatching shoes\nAnd\nA matching purse\nBack then, I went to a private school\nAnd\nI'd see all my friends there on the weekends\nAnd\nWe'd just go\nBut\nNow, they've got this youth mass\nAnd\nThey cut it down to thirty minutes\nPeople are a lot more casual\nEspecially during the summer, you'd see people in beach clothes, straight from the beach\nAnd\nFamilies running in late\nSo yeah, it's become more chill\nEven at the morning masses where I used to get all dressed up\nPeople wear jeans and khakis now\nI mean, khakis are nice but\nA lot more casual\nAs for other things\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed\nLike\nThat's the church I know\nI don't know the politics, but\nYeah\nThat's it\n[OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or priests to marry?]\nUm\nI think these things couldn't have been avoided\nBecause\nThere are married men who still become pedophiles\nAnd\nThey still have an attraction towards young kids\nSo\nI think it's not about the marriage thing\nUm\nIt's more about the person\nUm\nThey choose to become a priest\nUm\nThere are religions where they're allowed to marry, like on Seventh Heaven\nI don't know if he's a reverend or a minister or something\nBut\nThey're allowed to marry\nSo\nI know it's different\nBut\nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and get married, they should maybe think about a different faith\n[OK, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm\nAbout which part?\n[Um]\nJust the changing ways\n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess]\nOh, on the pedophilia\n[Mm hmm]\nUm\nI think, like, the whole sexuality thing\nUm\nI think it's mostly genetics\nI don't think people just become it\nI think they're born that way\nI don't think it has much to do with how they're brought up\nIt might have a little more to do in this case\nBut\nI think it's their genetics\nAnd\nYou can't really hide that through marriage\nYou could try\nBut\nThen it usually comes out\nSo\nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening\nUm\nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them\nBut\nI don't think in all cases they knew\n[OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUm, no",
            "Haha\nInitially, I was alright with the concept, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we kind of stumbled into Iraq with some flimsy excuses.\nThe Bush administration tried to link Iraq to bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, all of which turned out to be false. That really set my teeth on edge, and the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just sheer malfeasance of office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th are astounding. It seems like they came into office with a war in mind.\nI can't recall the name of the treasury secretary who made this claim in his book after being forced out, but it appears that Bush Jr. was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein and maybe to increase our energy supply, all underhanded and dishonest. It's gone on long enough, but a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths. The UN and US are now considering a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that might not be ideal either, as it could cause long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The Interim government is crumbling, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister's grip on the political process is weak, and radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party holds significant influence. It's a mess, and I can't articulate my thoughts in polite company.",
            "Alright then, let's dive into this. You want to talk about the Iraq War, huh? Not sure I'm the best person for this. I mean, it's not like I have a degree in political science or anything. But, alright, let me give it a shot.\n\nMmm, okay, so what I feel about the whole Iraq War thing is that it's just kind of pointless. I mean, it's not like it was a proper war, you know? It was more like a bit of revenge for 9/11. They figured it was Iraq that did the attacks, so we went and got back at them. But, I mean, I'm not really into the whole war thing, so I don't keep up with all the details.\n\nBut what I do know is that we're over there trying to build some sort of democracy, right? And maybe we're after their oil too? But, you know, it's not really worth it. It's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and build this democracy, which is gonna take forever. And if we leave, they'll be pissed at us for messing everything up and they'll have to start over. It's a real mess.\n\nYou know, this is hard. I don't really know much about it. I just feel bad for George Bush because it's making him look like one of the worst presidents ever. It's like the Vietnam War all over again. It's like, why are we still there? We didn't even declare it a war, you know? We just went and did it.\n\nI mean, I don't think it's a real war anymore. I feel like we're just over there to show off our big guns and stuff. But I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it's not really a war, you know? It's just a big mess.\n\nBut then again, I feel bad for the families of the soldiers over there. It's not fair to them. They've got lives too, you know? And now their kids don't have a safe place to go to school. And all those different groups are just killing each other because of their beliefs.\n\nBut, if we stay, we're just gonna make things worse. We'll be trying to mold them into some sort of second United States, and it'll just make Al-Qaeda even worse. I don't think it's gonna end anytime soon. It's just gonna go on and on.\n\nThat's about it, I guess. It's a real confusing situation.",
            "Well, honestly, I think it's a bit much to try and make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I mean, it's all about respecting the constitution's clear separation of church and state. It's right there, as clear as day, and I believe that attempting to impose any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of our constitutional principles. So, I'm not convinced that it's up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to declare illegal or legal. I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, and I believe that this is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government. Separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our constitution, and any amendment trying to restrict it would be wrong and contradictory to our founding principles. I don't see why the federal government should be involved anyway. It seems like this is just a push from a Catholic perspective, and I don't see how it will impact the economy or society. If anything, it might have a positive impact. I've said my piece, I think.",

I don't think the government was fully honest with the American people about the war's reason\nBefore invading Iraq, they attempted to connect the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but in reality, they weren't that linked\nThe government played on our emotions after the 9/11 attacks\nThe war began in 2003\nMe, I'm pretty much against war, especially preemptive strikes\nI think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the Vietnam War\nThe government should have learned from their past mistakes\nA ton of American soldiers died\nThey were removing the government and I don't think the American government was ready for what was to come\nThey removed the Iraqi government and tried to impose democracy, like they did in Vietnam to remove Communists\nThe government should have known it would be a long, tough process, not an easy victory\nWe're still there, almost 2006, and we're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces\nI think the government wasn't prepared and they tried to deceive us into thinking it would be a short, successful stay\nI mean, it's not easy to implement a new government and democracy was a struggle in our own country too\nI think the government made it seem like an easy task\nSo, the war in Iraq\nIt's a tough call\nI was thinking about the presidential election in 2004\nOne of my reasons for considering Bush was to finish what started, but now it's hard to leave after being there so long and having taken away their government\nWe can't just abandon them\nBut then there's the issue of the countless American casualties\nHow much more are we willing to risk for a democratic Iraq?\nGoing back to the reason for invading Iraq, why just Iraq?\nWhy not other countries?\nI think it's about oil, controlling resources\nAnd before the war, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found\nMeanwhile, places like North Korea, with known weapons, get a pass\nI don't think the government is being thorough or truthful enough with their decisions\nI just hope it ends soon, but probably not",

I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much for everyone to see, right? Myspace, for instance, you have to be a member to see someone's profile, and you usually need to be their friend. But if you accept them, then you're giving them permission to see it.

            "You know, I do believe that gender discrimination is still very much an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It really depends on the particular field of work you're in. For instance, women often face a glass ceiling where, despite their qualifications, they may not get promoted because historically women haven't been in the upper echelons of the business world. And it's not just men who face this issue. Fatherhood at home is often frowned upon by society, which expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men are often not taken seriously, especially if they're straight, because of societal expectations about gender roles. So, depending on the field, gender discrimination is definitely a reality.\n\nChanging these perceptions is slow because society has deeply ingrained mindsets. While we've made progress from the 1800s, change takes time. Women rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs is a step forward, and men staying at home is becoming more accepted. But it's a slow process, and we have to continue working at it. Promoting the positive qualities of those who are stereotypically discriminated against can help, but we can't force change too quickly or people will resist. We need to be patient and let societal attitudes evolve naturally.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't just about gender. It can also be about one's background. If you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't perfect, but you're intelligent and work your way up to a CEO position, other men might judge you harshly. So, it's not just about gender but also about where you come from and how you fit into society's expectations.",
            "I guess they didn't make it legal, they just moved it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, like a traffic ticket. If you get caught, you'll get cited, but no jail time. But, job interviews might still be tough. Decriminalizing it doesn't erase past convictions, but it saves money. Arresting, booking, and housing people costs a lot, and so does the court process. Many communities won't decriminalize it due to drug policies and finances. However, in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's a non-issue, and the savings go to education, social programs, and food assistance. I'm not saying it should be everywhere, but the financial aspect is compelling. It shouldn't be like cigarettes, sold everywhere and smoked in public. It's still taboo in many places.

You don't believe it should be a national issue, and you'd prefer each state make its own decision. After all, it's not like the president lives in every state and should make decisions for the entire country. Most states are democratic or republican, and it makes sense that democratic states would push for gay marriage. If you live in a state that's democratic, you should respect that decision, as you chose to live there. It's not like you're from every single state, and Bush shouldn't get to decide how each one operates. He's just gonna be out of office in a couple of years. It's best to leave decisions like this up to individual states, as they're the ones who'll be dealing with the consequences. Plus, if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban, it'll just be back and forth. So, let's leave it to the states, alright?",
            "Now look, I don't really care\nI mean, school shootings are serious business\nYou know, when you're talking about kids' lives on the line, it's sorta important to keep an eye on things\nAnd if that means checking up on what students are doing on the internet, well, I get it\nI mean, it's a public space, right?\nSo if a kid is putting stuff out there that could get them in trouble, yeah, school officials have every right to check it out\nIt's not like they're just snooping for no reason\nThey're doing it to keep the school safe, you know?\nBut if they're just going on there to catch students in the act of doing something wrong, that's where it gets a bit shady\nIt starts feeling like an invasion of privacy\nBut if they're trying to stop something bad from happening, like a school shooting or something, well, that's a different story\nThey're just doing their job, making sure the school is a safer place\nAnd you know, it's a public thing, posting on the internet, so if you're not expecting to get in trouble, that's on you\nYou can't really complain about someone seeing what you've put out there\nAnd it's not just about posting on the internet\nIt's about the whole concept of privacy\nLike, if you send an email to someone and it gets lost or ends up in the wrong hands, it's out there forever\nYou can't take it back\nAnd if you don't watch what you say, it can come back to haunt you\nLike, one day you might end up being some big shot and then someone finds that old email you sent when you were a college student\nIt's a big world out there, and nothing really stays hidden for long\nSo if school officials are trying to keep the students safe, well, good for them\nAs long as they're not just doing it to catch someone in the act of doing something wrong\nThey're just doing their job, making sure the school is a safer place for everyone\nAnd I mean, who likes having those kinds of surprises come back to haunt you, right?",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nInitially, I was all for it. The events of nine eleven had a profound personal impact on me.\nUm\nAt first, I was all for going there and causing as much disruption as they did to us.\nUm\nI believe that, due to the emotional nature of the event, we overlooked many things and didn't consider the long-term implications.\nAnd we went over there unprepared, without a well-thought-out plan.\nUm\nI really think it backfired on us.\nUm\nI don’t know\nI was all for it initially,\nBut now I’m very against it.\nI don’t think it has achieved anything.\nUm\nI think the people over there,\nAs long as they’re fighting among themselves, they can’t fight against us too.\nLike, I don’t think our presence over there will help if they can’t even get along.\nSo um\nLike, unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone one definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"
