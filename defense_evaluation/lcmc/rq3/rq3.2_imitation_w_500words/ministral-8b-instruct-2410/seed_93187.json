            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe, there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church ought to evolve. They've been addressing their dwindling attendance, and I reckon it's due to their rather rigid stances on certain matters. For instance, they've been pretty staunch on behalf of gay marriage, abortion, and contraception. Their positions, while steadfast, seem a tad outdated. I think if they embraced a more contemporary perspective, they'd find their flock less likely to wander. I've witnessed a shift in public opinion, with some people turning against the Church, not aligning with their views on these topics. People are simply losing patience with their stance. Take abortion, for example; if one supports it, they might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's deemed entirely wrong. The same goes for issues like gay marriage. I don't see why female priests are off the table or why priests can't have families. After all, most people balance a job and a family life. Perhaps allowing priests to marry wouldn't change their actions, but it's a matter I'd like to see explored. It's hard to say for certain, but I do believe it's worth considering.",
            "So, I'm not against gay marriage, really. It's like, whether someone is born that way or whatever, it doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn't feel like a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for. So, I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I wouldn't want the federal government to be involved in this. It just feels like it's not their place to interject in people's lives. This isn't about security or morality, it's just how people are born. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, for the simple reason that there's no compelling argument against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family, but it's a complex issue with numerous aspects that make it distinct from heterosexual unions. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin—heads and tails, yet they are essentially the same. There are civil rights involved, like property taxes and healthcare, which are not available to gay couples in the same way. For instance, if a gay couple is in the hospital, their partner can't visit or be in the room if they're not considered family. It seems silly to spend your life with someone and not grant them these basic rights. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The issue is that people get caught up on the idea that homosexuals want to get married in a church, but they're asking for a legal document from the government. If church and state involvement is removed, it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation—separate but unequal. Gay couples and their relationships are the same in many ways, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but the main concern is how children of gay couples will adjust. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. President Bush has strong religious views against it, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against it are moral in nature, but morality varies among individuals, and it's unethical to enforce one group's morality on the entire country. The government should not create an amendment based on religious beliefs, considering recent controversies like the pledge of allegiance's \"under God\" clause. Many people are anti-gay because they believe it's a result of psychological damage from childhood trauma or personality defects, but this is not supported by research. Institutions that have studied this issue, like the American Psychological Association, have debunked these myths, and people should rely on actual research rather than popular opinion or cultural beliefs.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, you know? Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. It's just not beneficial to have it readily available to the public. Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, you name it. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny their benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then it's pointless for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don't think it's similar to alcohol because, sure, if you abuse it, that can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, you know, it can too. It's a tough one. I'd say we could integrate it, make it legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But first, you gotta remove that taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine or something like that. So, if we get rid of that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I reckon the church has become more adaptable to the twenty-first century. It's not as stringent as it once was. I remember, when I was younger, I'd always attend church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little dresses and matching shoes and purse. Back then, I was in a private school where I'd see all my friends there on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that's cut down to thirty minutes and people dress a lot more casually, especially during the summer. Sometimes, you'd see folks coming in straight from the beach or families running in late. Even during the morning masses where I'd always dress up, folks are sporting jeans and khakis now. It seems to be more laid-back, overall. I don't delve into the politics of the church, but that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. I believe men who become pedophiles can't change that nature just because they're allowed to get married. They choose to become priests, and there are other religions where they're allowed to get married. If they genuinely want to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely genetic. I don't think it's something people are brought up to become. It can't be hidden through marriage, and it often comes out. Therefore, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it, though if they knew and tried to cover it up, they're to blame. But I don't think in all cases they knew.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Alright, so at first I was fine with the idea of the Iraq war, but I think we were all still grappling with the aftermath of September 11th. It seems like the Bush administration used the attacks as an excuse to go into Iraq, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know was false. That's what really gets my goat about the whole thing.\n\nI mean, they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, who made a big speech at the UN about it, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence. That's just about as bad as it gets. The Bush administration acted like they had no regard for the Constitution, and it seems like they've been trying to water it down ever since September 11th. It's like they were just looking for a reason to go to war.\n\nIt's all really been dragging on for too long. I think if we pulled out now, it would be a mess. There's a risk the country could descend into civil war and more people would die. The UN and the U.S. are talking about a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia stepping in to restore order, but that might just make things worse in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty would be a major issue, and it seems like the interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and even the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control over what's happening. Plus, we're still dealing with radical elements vying for power, like Muqtada al-Sadr. The political situation is pretty chaotic, to say the least.",

            "I'm not sure if it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I believe the constitution has already spoken on this matter, stating a clear separation between church and state. It seems that those pushing for it are choosing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I think it's more about personal religion than anything else. The government shouldn't interfere with what the churches allow or disallow. Making an amendment would be contradictory to the constitution's established clauses. It's not about restricting the government, but restricting people's freedoms. I don't see why the federal government should be involved in this. The president's push for an amendment is just a reflection of his personal Catholic beliefs, which doesn't make it a good reason to restrict people's choices. I think it's best left to the churches. It's not about economy or any other reason, but rather about personal views. I've pretty much said all there is to say on this.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though they didn’t have much to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think it’s a repeat of many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes.\nThe war in Iraq has been a tremendous loss for American soldiers, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that followed. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to what they did in Vietnam. They were trying to remove Communists and uphold democracy, but it’s been a long and hard ordeal.\nI think the government was not as prepared as they should have been. They didn’t plan for all possible outcomes. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. Trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country is a long process.\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn’t be naïve about the time it takes to implement a new form of government. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle. It just isn’t an easy thing to do. The government made it seem like it would be relatively easy.\nWell, it’s a difficult decision because I felt that way in the election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in and you’ve been there for so long, how can you abandon them?\nIt’s probably something we should see to its finish, but again there’s the consideration of the American casualties. How much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq?\nWhy is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It’s where we get our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nBefore going into war, one of the reasons was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. No weapons were ever found, yet places like North Korea, which we knew had them, we are not attacking. I don’t think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "Well, um\nI've always stood for, uh, gay marriage\nIt's been a personal preference, you know, and something that's been increasingly shown to be more biological than sociological\nSo, to take away rights from people for something they can't control seems kind of, uh, inhumane\nI’ve always been an advocate for it\n\nI think politics and government should keep their hands off this\nIt's not even on a state level, it's a personal, household level\nYou know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples\nThey function just like any other family\nThey walk their dogs, they do the same stuff as anyone else\n\nI mean, with Bush trying to define marriage his way, it's a bit ridiculous\nI think it's something that should be a personal, private matter\nIt's not something that should be made public, or national, or federal\n\nUh, no, not at all",

            "I feel like the war has been dragged on far too long. The initial purpose seemed noble—restoring democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of asserting our power. Maybe the original motivations were tainted by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the primary aim was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause. However, I don't think our reason for continuing the war is as clear-cut now. It feels like we're still engaged in the conflict just to prove we're a powerful nation, and we don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. I think it's been going on for far too long. The country's government should be able to handle itself by now. We've spent billions of dollars on this war while our own economy is struggling with issues like poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own communities, such as fixing public roads and schools, or addressing healthcare needs. It's a drain on our economy to keep fighting a war that's lost its purpose.",
            "I've got a question, buddy. You see, some dude went and checked out an online post and something bad was prevented. I mean, it's pretty clear that stuff you post on the internet is there for everyone to see, right?\n\nOn sites like Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile. You're giving them permission to check it out, so if someone did that, they've agreed to it. I'm not saying it's right, but it's their choice.\n\nIt's tough to know, though, if someone's looking at your profile for a reason or just stumbling upon it. I don't think it's fair for one person to spend days looking through everyone's profiles just to find something fishy. But if they're looking for evidence of something specific, that's different.\n\nI've got a Facebook myself, and it bothers me that there are creepers out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a show where a guy got a girl's screen name in less than a minute and talked to her instantly over IM. I'd never meet someone like that, but I've had classmates who know my screen name and my interests. It's a weird feeling, knowing they can see so much about me. I try to limit what I put up, but it's tricky because I use it to stay in touch with friends. I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate's old high school had a ban on Myspace. I'm not sure that's right. How can school officials tell students they can't have a Myspace? It's a bit strange, isn't it?",

            "I gotta say, I believe gender discrimination is still very much a reality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It's about the specific industry you're in too. Like, overall, women face the glass ceiling. Even today, many struggle to find a position where they're not working under a man due to societal conditioning. I mean, people just aren't comfortable with the idea of a woman being in charge. And it's the same for men in fields like fashion or staying at home as a parent. Society has this archaic view that men should be the breadwinners, so when a man stays at home, people look down on him. Or in fashion, people don't take men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's like, \"How can you understand fashion if you're a guy?\" It's all about stereotypes. I think we need to keep working at this because change is slow. Women are starting to take on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, but it's a slow process. We need to keep promoting these roles, not forcing them. If we do it too fast, people will resist. And yeah, it's not just men vs. women, it's also about where you come from and how you speak. If you're from a rural area and have poor grammar but are highly intelligent, other men might not take you seriously. It's complex, but it's real.",
            "Let me set the record straight; they didn't make marijuana legal, they just took it off the criminal books and turned it into more of a traffic fine sort of deal. You know, like getting cited and not arrested. Now, if someone gets caught, it's not like they'll get a job offer or anything, but it's still not as bad as a drug charge. I mean, sure, it's not a walk in the park, but at least it's not as severe. They say decriminalizing it costs a fortune in terms of legal fees, court time, and all that. It's a lot of money that could be used for other things. Like Denver, for instance, where people are more open-minded - they've probably got better things to spend their money on now, like education and social programs. But hey, it's not like marijuana should be sold everywhere. It's still a bit of a taboo in many places, and I don't think people just want it out in the open. Plus, it can affect people differently. Some people might end up in the hospital, or even worse. I mean, alcohol has its own set of problems, and you never know how someone's going to react to it. It's a tough call, but I guess we have to take it day by day.",
            "I'd say yes, traditions are crucial, no doubt about it. They offer a sense of continuity and familiarity that’s comforting. But, adapting to change is equally vital. Consider the rigid ways of the Catholic Church, where weekly attendance and strict adherence to doctrine are the norm. It's almost as if they judge those who don't meet their standards, and that extends to those of other faiths too. My parents are a prime example—my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't allow our parents to marry in the Catholic Church, despite their love for each other. Talk about a lack of tolerance! You know the Church teaches to love others, but in practice, it's often hypocritical. They're rooted in outdated traditions, yet they persist. I believe priests marrying wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior. After all, abusers act on their impulses, regardless of their marital status. I don't think marriage would stop that kind of behavior. It's just a different realm. Sure, it might deter some, but it's not a panacea.",
            "Well, I'm still grappling with this issue, so I can't say which side has the right of it. It's a tricky matter, really, right on the edge of where church and state meet. How to define marriage is a slippery slope. It's hard to do without causing offense. So, I'm not sure, but I think we might just treat all civil unions the same, like they are, two people united. Why should the government poke into what kind of union it is, whether it's a sacrament or not? And if you're married, why not just call it a civil union? It's just two people coming together, right? Now, if the states can agree on this, they should push to make it federal law. But banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just absurd. The constitution shouldn't be amended for such a divisive but not necessarily crucial issue. It's just too small a cause to amend the constitution over. So, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is sort of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. It's not like the president can live in every state and make the decision for everyone. Some states are democratic and will push for gay marriage, while others are republican and won't. If you live in a state that decides to legalize it, you should respect that decision. After all, you chose to live there. I think homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't think Bush should decide the whole country should be against gay marriage. He doesn't live in every state, and he shouldn't have that kind of power. Some things should be left up to individual states. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years, and if a democratic president lifts the ban, it's just going to go back and forth. It should be up to the states, as they'll have to live with the decision. I don't agree with his ban on it.",

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe, there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church ought to evolve. They've been addressing their dwindling attendance, and I reckon it's due to their rather rigid stances on certain matters. For instance, they've been pretty staunch on behalf of gay marriage, abortion, and contraception. Their positions, while steadfast, seem a tad outdated. I think if they embraced a more contemporary perspective, they'd find their flock less likely to wander. I've witnessed a shift in public opinion, with some people turning against the Church, not aligning with their views on these topics. People are simply losing patience with their stance. Take abortion, for example; if one supports it, they might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's deemed entirely wrong. The same goes for issues like gay marriage. I don't see why female priests are off the table or why priests can't have families. After all, most people balance a job and a family life. Perhaps allowing priests to marry wouldn't change their actions, but it's a matter I'd like to see explored. It's hard to say for certain, but I do believe it's worth considering.",
            "So, I'm not against gay marriage, really. It's like, whether someone is born that way or whatever, it doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn't feel like a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for. So, I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I wouldn't want the federal government to be involved in this. It just feels like it's not their place to interject in people's lives. This isn't about security or morality, it's just how people are born. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, for the simple reason that there's no compelling argument against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family, but it's a complex issue with numerous aspects that make it distinct from heterosexual unions. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin—heads and tails, yet they are essentially the same. There are civil rights involved, like property taxes and healthcare, which are not available to gay couples in the same way. For instance, if a gay couple is in the hospital, their partner can't visit or be in the room if they're not considered family. It seems silly to spend your life with someone and not grant them these basic rights. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The issue is that people get caught up on the idea that homosexuals want to get married in a church, but they're asking for a legal document from the government. If church and state involvement is removed, it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation—separate but unequal. Gay couples and their relationships are the same in many ways, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but the main concern is how children of gay couples will adjust. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. President Bush has strong religious views against it, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against it are moral in nature, but morality varies among individuals, and it's unethical to enforce one group's morality on the entire country. The government should not create an amendment based on religious beliefs, considering recent controversies like the pledge of allegiance's \"under God\" clause. Many people are anti-gay because they believe it's a result of psychological damage from childhood trauma or personality defects, but this is not supported by research. Institutions that have studied this issue, like the American Psychological Association, have debunked these myths, and people should rely on actual research rather than popular opinion or cultural beliefs.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, you know? Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. It's just not beneficial to have it readily available to the public. Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, you name it. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny their benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then it's pointless for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don't think it's similar to alcohol because, sure, if you abuse it, that can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, you know, it can too. It's a tough one. I'd say we could integrate it, make it legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But first, you gotta remove that taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine or something like that. So, if we get rid of that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I reckon the church has become more adaptable to the twenty-first century. It's not as stringent as it once was. I remember, when I was younger, I'd always attend church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little dresses and matching shoes and purse. Back then, I was in a private school where I'd see all my friends there on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that's cut down to thirty minutes and people dress a lot more casually, especially during the summer. Sometimes, you'd see folks coming in straight from the beach or families running in late. Even during the morning masses where I'd always dress up, folks are sporting jeans and khakis now. It seems to be more laid-back, overall. I don't delve into the politics of the church, but that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. I believe men who become pedophiles can't change that nature just because they're allowed to get married. They choose to become priests, and there are other religions where they're allowed to get married. If they genuinely want to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely genetic. I don't think it's something people are brought up to become. It can't be hidden through marriage, and it often comes out. Therefore, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it, though if they knew and tried to cover it up, they're to blame. But I don't think in all cases they knew.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Alright, so at first I was fine with the idea of the Iraq war, but I think we were all still grappling with the aftermath of September 11th. It seems like the Bush administration used the attacks as an excuse to go into Iraq, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know was false. That's what really gets my goat about the whole thing.\n\nI mean, they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, who made a big speech at the UN about it, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence. That's just about as bad as it gets. The Bush administration acted like they had no regard for the Constitution, and it seems like they've been trying to water it down ever since September 11th. It's like they were just looking for a reason to go to war.\n\nIt's all really been dragging on for too long. I think if we pulled out now, it would be a mess. There's a risk the country could descend into civil war and more people would die. The UN and the U.S. are talking about a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia stepping in to restore order, but that might just make things worse in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty would be a major issue, and it seems like the interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and even the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control over what's happening. Plus, we're still dealing with radical elements vying for power, like Muqtada al-Sadr. The political situation is pretty chaotic, to say the least.",

            "I'm not sure if it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I believe the constitution has already spoken on this matter, stating a clear separation between church and state. It seems that those pushing for it are choosing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I think it's more about personal religion than anything else. The government shouldn't interfere with what the churches allow or disallow. Making an amendment would be contradictory to the constitution's established clauses. It's not about restricting the government, but restricting people's freedoms. I don't see why the federal government should be involved in this. The president's push for an amendment is just a reflection of his personal Catholic beliefs, which doesn't make it a good reason to restrict people's choices. I think it's best left to the churches. It's not about economy or any other reason, but rather about personal views. I've pretty much said all there is to say on this.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though they didn’t have much to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think it’s a repeat of many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes.\nThe war in Iraq has been a tremendous loss for American soldiers, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that followed. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to what they did in Vietnam. They were trying to remove Communists and uphold democracy, but it’s been a long and hard ordeal.\nI think the government was not as prepared as they should have been. They didn’t plan for all possible outcomes. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. Trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country is a long process.\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn’t be naïve about the time it takes to implement a new form of government. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle. It just isn’t an easy thing to do. The government made it seem like it would be relatively easy.\nWell, it’s a difficult decision because I felt that way in the election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in and you’ve been there for so long, how can you abandon them?\nIt’s probably something we should see to its finish, but again there’s the consideration of the American casualties. How much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq?\nWhy is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It’s where we get our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nBefore going into war, one of the reasons was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. No weapons were ever found, yet places like North Korea, which we knew had them, we are not attacking. I don’t think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "Well, um\nI've always stood for, uh, gay marriage\nIt's been a personal preference, you know, and something that's been increasingly shown to be more biological than sociological\nSo, to take away rights from people for something they can't control seems kind of, uh, inhumane\nI’ve always been an advocate for it\n\nI think politics and government should keep their hands off this\nIt's not even on a state level, it's a personal, household level\nYou know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples\nThey function just like any other family\nThey walk their dogs, they do the same stuff as anyone else\n\nI mean, with Bush trying to define marriage his way, it's a bit ridiculous\nI think it's something that should be a personal, private matter\nIt's not something that should be made public, or national, or federal\n\nUh, no, not at all",

            "I feel like the war has been dragged on far too long. The initial purpose seemed noble—restoring democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of asserting our power. Maybe the original motivations were tainted by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the primary aim was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause. However, I don't think our reason for continuing the war is as clear-cut now. It feels like we're still engaged in the conflict just to prove we're a powerful nation, and we don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. I think it's been going on for far too long. The country's government should be able to handle itself by now. We've spent billions of dollars on this war while our own economy is struggling with issues like poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own communities, such as fixing public roads and schools, or addressing healthcare needs. It's a drain on our economy to keep fighting a war that's lost its purpose.",
            "I've got a question, buddy. You see, some dude went and checked out an online post and something bad was prevented. I mean, it's pretty clear that stuff you post on the internet is there for everyone to see, right?\n\nOn sites like Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile. You're giving them permission to check it out, so if someone did that, they've agreed to it. I'm not saying it's right, but it's their choice.\n\nIt's tough to know, though, if someone's looking at your profile for a reason or just stumbling upon it. I don't think it's fair for one person to spend days looking through everyone's profiles just to find something fishy. But if they're looking for evidence of something specific, that's different.\n\nI've got a Facebook myself, and it bothers me that there are creepers out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a show where a guy got a girl's screen name in less than a minute and talked to her instantly over IM. I'd never meet someone like that, but I've had classmates who know my screen name and my interests. It's a weird feeling, knowing they can see so much about me. I try to limit what I put up, but it's tricky because I use it to stay in touch with friends. I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate's old high school had a ban on Myspace. I'm not sure that's right. How can school officials tell students they can't have a Myspace? It's a bit strange, isn't it?",

            "I gotta say, I believe gender discrimination is still very much a reality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It's about the specific industry you're in too. Like, overall, women face the glass ceiling. Even today, many struggle to find a position where they're not working under a man due to societal conditioning. I mean, people just aren't comfortable with the idea of a woman being in charge. And it's the same for men in fields like fashion or staying at home as a parent. Society has this archaic view that men should be the breadwinners, so when a man stays at home, people look down on him. Or in fashion, people don't take men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's like, \"How can you understand fashion if you're a guy?\" It's all about stereotypes. I think we need to keep working at this because change is slow. Women are starting to take on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, but it's a slow process. We need to keep promoting these roles, not forcing them. If we do it too fast, people will resist. And yeah, it's not just men vs. women, it's also about where you come from and how you speak. If you're from a rural area and have poor grammar but are highly intelligent, other men might not take you seriously. It's complex, but it's real.",
            "Let me set the record straight; they didn't make marijuana legal, they just took it off the criminal books and turned it into more of a traffic fine sort of deal. You know, like getting cited and not arrested. Now, if someone gets caught, it's not like they'll get a job offer or anything, but it's still not as bad as a drug charge. I mean, sure, it's not a walk in the park, but at least it's not as severe. They say decriminalizing it costs a fortune in terms of legal fees, court time, and all that. It's a lot of money that could be used for other things. Like Denver, for instance, where people are more open-minded - they've probably got better things to spend their money on now, like education and social programs. But hey, it's not like marijuana should be sold everywhere. It's still a bit of a taboo in many places, and I don't think people just want it out in the open. Plus, it can affect people differently. Some people might end up in the hospital, or even worse. I mean, alcohol has its own set of problems, and you never know how someone's going to react to it. It's a tough call, but I guess we have to take it day by day.",
            "I'd say yes, traditions are crucial, no doubt about it. They offer a sense of continuity and familiarity that’s comforting. But, adapting to change is equally vital. Consider the rigid ways of the Catholic Church, where weekly attendance and strict adherence to doctrine are the norm. It's almost as if they judge those who don't meet their standards, and that extends to those of other faiths too. My parents are a prime example—my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't allow our parents to marry in the Catholic Church, despite their love for each other. Talk about a lack of tolerance! You know the Church teaches to love others, but in practice, it's often hypocritical. They're rooted in outdated traditions, yet they persist. I believe priests marrying wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior. After all, abusers act on their impulses, regardless of their marital status. I don't think marriage would stop that kind of behavior. It's just a different realm. Sure, it might deter some, but it's not a panacea.",
            "Well, I'm still grappling with this issue, so I can't say which side has the right of it. It's a tricky matter, really, right on the edge of where church and state meet. How to define marriage is a slippery slope. It's hard to do without causing offense. So, I'm not sure, but I think we might just treat all civil unions the same, like they are, two people united. Why should the government poke into what kind of union it is, whether it's a sacrament or not? And if you're married, why not just call it a civil union? It's just two people coming together, right? Now, if the states can agree on this, they should push to make it federal law. But banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just absurd. The constitution shouldn't be amended for such a divisive but not necessarily crucial issue. It's just too small a cause to amend the constitution over. So, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is sort of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. It's not like the president can live in every state and make the decision for everyone. Some states are democratic and will push for gay marriage, while others are republican and won't. If you live in a state that decides to legalize it, you should respect that decision. After all, you chose to live there. I think homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't think Bush should decide the whole country should be against gay marriage. He doesn't live in every state, and he shouldn't have that kind of power. Some things should be left up to individual states. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years, and if a democratic president lifts the ban, it's just going to go back and forth. It should be up to the states, as they'll have to live with the decision. I don't agree with his ban on it.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe, there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church ought to evolve. They've been addressing their dwindling attendance, and I reckon it's due to their rather rigid stances on certain matters. For instance, they've been pretty staunch on behalf of gay marriage, abortion, and contraception. Their positions, while steadfast, seem a tad outdated. I think if they embraced a more contemporary perspective, they'd find their flock less likely to wander. I've witnessed a shift in public opinion, with some people turning against the Church, not aligning with their views on these topics. People are simply losing patience with their stance. Take abortion, for example; if one supports it, they might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's deemed entirely wrong. The same goes for issues like gay marriage. I don't see why female priests are off the table or why priests can't have families. After all, most people balance a job and a family life. Perhaps allowing priests to marry wouldn't change their actions, but it's a matter I'd like to see explored. It's hard to say for certain, but I do believe it's worth considering.",
            "So, I'm not against gay marriage, really. It's like, whether someone is born that way or whatever, it doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn't feel like a conscious decision that they should be held responsible for. So, I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I wouldn't want the federal government to be involved in this. It just feels like it's not their place to interject in people's lives. This isn't about security or morality, it's just how people are born. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, for the simple reason that there's no compelling argument against it. Many people fear that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family, but it's a complex issue with numerous aspects that make it distinct from heterosexual unions. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin—heads and tails, yet they are essentially the same. There are civil rights involved, like property taxes and healthcare, which are not available to gay couples in the same way. For instance, if a gay couple is in the hospital, their partner can't visit or be in the room if they're not considered family. It seems silly to spend your life with someone and not grant them these basic rights. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The issue is that people get caught up on the idea that homosexuals want to get married in a church, but they're asking for a legal document from the government. If church and state involvement is removed, it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation—separate but unequal. Gay couples and their relationships are the same in many ways, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but the main concern is how children of gay couples will adjust. In New York City, they have special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. President Bush has strong religious views against it, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against it are moral in nature, but morality varies among individuals, and it's unethical to enforce one group's morality on the entire country. The government should not create an amendment based on religious beliefs, considering recent controversies like the pledge of allegiance's \"under God\" clause. Many people are anti-gay because they believe it's a result of psychological damage from childhood trauma or personality defects, but this is not supported by research. Institutions that have studied this issue, like the American Psychological Association, have debunked these myths, and people should rely on actual research rather than popular opinion or cultural beliefs.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, you know? Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. It's just not beneficial to have it readily available to the public. Absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? Yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are plenty of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, you name it. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny their benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then it's pointless for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don't think it's similar to alcohol because, sure, if you abuse it, that can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, you know, it can too. It's a tough one. I'd say we could integrate it, make it legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But first, you gotta remove that taboo around marijuana. Then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine or something like that. So, if we get rid of that image, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I reckon the church has become more adaptable to the twenty-first century. It's not as stringent as it once was. I remember, when I was younger, I'd always attend church every Sunday, dressed in my cute little dresses and matching shoes and purse. Back then, I was in a private school where I'd see all my friends there on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that's cut down to thirty minutes and people dress a lot more casually, especially during the summer. Sometimes, you'd see folks coming in straight from the beach or families running in late. Even during the morning masses where I'd always dress up, folks are sporting jeans and khakis now. It seems to be more laid-back, overall. I don't delve into the politics of the church, but that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. I believe men who become pedophiles can't change that nature just because they're allowed to get married. They choose to become priests, and there are other religions where they're allowed to get married. If they genuinely want to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is largely genetic. I don't think it's something people are brought up to become. It can't be hidden through marriage, and it often comes out. Therefore, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it, though if they knew and tried to cover it up, they're to blame. But I don't think in all cases they knew.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church.",
            "Alright, so at first I was fine with the idea of the Iraq war, but I think we were all still grappling with the aftermath of September 11th. It seems like the Bush administration used the attacks as an excuse to go into Iraq, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know was false. That's what really gets my goat about the whole thing.\n\nI mean, they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, who made a big speech at the UN about it, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence. That's just about as bad as it gets. The Bush administration acted like they had no regard for the Constitution, and it seems like they've been trying to water it down ever since September 11th. It's like they were just looking for a reason to go to war.\n\nIt's all really been dragging on for too long. I think if we pulled out now, it would be a mess. There's a risk the country could descend into civil war and more people would die. The UN and the U.S. are talking about a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia stepping in to restore order, but that might just make things worse in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty would be a major issue, and it seems like the interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and even the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control over what's happening. Plus, we're still dealing with radical elements vying for power, like Muqtada al-Sadr. The political situation is pretty chaotic, to say the least.",

            "I'm not sure if it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I believe the constitution has already spoken on this matter, stating a clear separation between church and state. It seems that those pushing for it are choosing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I think it's more about personal religion than anything else. The government shouldn't interfere with what the churches allow or disallow. Making an amendment would be contradictory to the constitution's established clauses. It's not about restricting the government, but restricting people's freedoms. I don't see why the federal government should be involved in this. The president's push for an amendment is just a reflection of his personal Catholic beliefs, which doesn't make it a good reason to restrict people's choices. I think it's best left to the churches. It's not about economy or any other reason, but rather about personal views. I've pretty much said all there is to say on this.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though they didn’t have much to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think it’s a repeat of many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes.\nThe war in Iraq has been a tremendous loss for American soldiers, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that followed. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to what they did in Vietnam. They were trying to remove Communists and uphold democracy, but it’s been a long and hard ordeal.\nI think the government was not as prepared as they should have been. They didn’t plan for all possible outcomes. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. Trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country is a long process.\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn’t be naïve about the time it takes to implement a new form of government. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle. It just isn’t an easy thing to do. The government made it seem like it would be relatively easy.\nWell, it’s a difficult decision because I felt that way in the election. One of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in and you’ve been there for so long, how can you abandon them?\nIt’s probably something we should see to its finish, but again there’s the consideration of the American casualties. How much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq?\nWhy is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It’s where we get our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nBefore going into war, one of the reasons was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. No weapons were ever found, yet places like North Korea, which we knew had them, we are not attacking. I don’t think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",

            "I feel like the war has been dragged on far too long. The initial purpose seemed noble—restoring democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. But I think we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for the sake of asserting our power. Maybe the original motivations were tainted by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the primary aim was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause. However, I don't think our reason for continuing the war is as clear-cut now. It feels like we're still engaged in the conflict just to prove we're a powerful nation, and we don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. I think it's been going on for far too long. The country's government should be able to handle itself by now. We've spent billions of dollars on this war while our own economy is struggling with issues like poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own communities, such as fixing public roads and schools, or addressing healthcare needs. It's a drain on our economy to keep fighting a war that's lost its purpose.",
            "I've got a question, buddy. You see, some dude went and checked out an online post and something bad was prevented. I mean, it's pretty clear that stuff you post on the internet is there for everyone to see, right?\n\nOn sites like Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile. You're giving them permission to check it out, so if someone did that, they've agreed to it. I'm not saying it's right, but it's their choice.\n\nIt's tough to know, though, if someone's looking at your profile for a reason or just stumbling upon it. I don't think it's fair for one person to spend days looking through everyone's profiles just to find something fishy. But if they're looking for evidence of something specific, that's different.\n\nI've got a Facebook myself, and it bothers me that there are creepers out there who can see my stuff. I've seen a show where a guy got a girl's screen name in less than a minute and talked to her instantly over IM. I'd never meet someone like that, but I've had classmates who know my screen name and my interests. It's a weird feeling, knowing they can see so much about me. I try to limit what I put up, but it's tricky because I use it to stay in touch with friends. I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nI heard my roommate's old high school had a ban on Myspace. I'm not sure that's right. How can school officials tell students they can't have a Myspace? It's a bit strange, isn't it?",

            "I gotta say, I believe gender discrimination is still very much a reality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It's about the specific industry you're in too. Like, overall, women face the glass ceiling. Even today, many struggle to find a position where they're not working under a man due to societal conditioning. I mean, people just aren't comfortable with the idea of a woman being in charge. And it's the same for men in fields like fashion or staying at home as a parent. Society has this archaic view that men should be the breadwinners, so when a man stays at home, people look down on him. Or in fashion, people don't take men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's like, \"How can you understand fashion if you're a guy?\" It's all about stereotypes. I think we need to keep working at this because change is slow. Women are starting to take on more leadership roles, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, but it's a slow process. We need to keep promoting these roles, not forcing them. If we do it too fast, people will resist. And yeah, it's not just men vs. women, it's also about where you come from and how you speak. If you're from a rural area and have poor grammar but are highly intelligent, other men might not take you seriously. It's complex, but it's real.",
            "Let me set the record straight; they didn't make marijuana legal, they just took it off the criminal books and turned it into more of a traffic fine sort of deal. You know, like getting cited and not arrested. Now, if someone gets caught, it's not like they'll get a job offer or anything, but it's still not as bad as a drug charge. I mean, sure, it's not a walk in the park, but at least it's not as severe. They say decriminalizing it costs a fortune in terms of legal fees, court time, and all that. It's a lot of money that could be used for other things. Like Denver, for instance, where people are more open-minded - they've probably got better things to spend their money on now, like education and social programs. But hey, it's not like marijuana should be sold everywhere. It's still a bit of a taboo in many places, and I don't think people just want it out in the open. Plus, it can affect people differently. Some people might end up in the hospital, or even worse. I mean, alcohol has its own set of problems, and you never know how someone's going to react to it. It's a tough call, but I guess we have to take it day by day.",
            "I'd say yes, traditions are crucial, no doubt about it. They offer a sense of continuity and familiarity that’s comforting. But, adapting to change is equally vital. Consider the rigid ways of the Catholic Church, where weekly attendance and strict adherence to doctrine are the norm. It's almost as if they judge those who don't meet their standards, and that extends to those of other faiths too. My parents are a prime example—my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't allow our parents to marry in the Catholic Church, despite their love for each other. Talk about a lack of tolerance! You know the Church teaches to love others, but in practice, it's often hypocritical. They're rooted in outdated traditions, yet they persist. I believe priests marrying wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior. After all, abusers act on their impulses, regardless of their marital status. I don't think marriage would stop that kind of behavior. It's just a different realm. Sure, it might deter some, but it's not a panacea.",
            "Well, I'm still grappling with this issue, so I can't say which side has the right of it. It's a tricky matter, really, right on the edge of where church and state meet. How to define marriage is a slippery slope. It's hard to do without causing offense. So, I'm not sure, but I think we might just treat all civil unions the same, like they are, two people united. Why should the government poke into what kind of union it is, whether it's a sacrament or not? And if you're married, why not just call it a civil union? It's just two people coming together, right? Now, if the states can agree on this, they should push to make it federal law. But banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just absurd. The constitution shouldn't be amended for such a divisive but not necessarily crucial issue. It's just too small a cause to amend the constitution over. So, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is sort of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. It's not like the president can live in every state and make the decision for everyone. Some states are democratic and will push for gay marriage, while others are republican and won't. If you live in a state that decides to legalize it, you should respect that decision. After all, you chose to live there. I think homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't think Bush should decide the whole country should be against gay marriage. He doesn't live in every state, and he shouldn't have that kind of power. Some things should be left up to individual states. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years, and if a democratic president lifts the ban, it's just going to go back and forth. It should be up to the states, as they'll have to live with the decision. I don't agree with his ban on it.",
