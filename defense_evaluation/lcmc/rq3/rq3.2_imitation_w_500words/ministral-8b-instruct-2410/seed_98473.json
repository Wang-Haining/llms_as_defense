            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon, in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to adapt. They've been grappling with their declining membership, and I believe it's because they're not very welcoming to a lot of contemporary views, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stances are quite conservative, and I think if they loosened up a bit, they'd retain more followers. I've heard plenty of folks steering away from the Church due to their rigid views on these topics. People these days don't align with their stance on these issues, so they're starting to turn their backs. For instance, if you're pro-choice, you might not want to be part of a community that deems abortion wrong. The same goes for those who support gay marriage. I can't see why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented the recent scandals. They might have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women in the priesthood, but it's hard to say for sure. I mean, aren't priests supposed to be devoted to their work and their families just like everyone else?",

            "Alright, so I spend the summer bustling in a hospital pharmacy. You know, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its uses. It's all about striking a balance. Sure, I'd say no to making it widely available to the public. No way. But for medicinal purposes? Absolutely, yes. It's about the benefits, not the stigma. Yeah, there are plenty of controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percoets, and we use them all the time because they're beneficial and effective. If you deny their worth just because there's a negative stigma around marijuana, that's a waste of time for me. You need to embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol, though both can be abused. It's a tough one. I'd suggest gradually integrating it, removing the taboo around it first, then letting it become legal. But if you just legalize it all at once, it'll likely be abused. You gotta remove that negative image of marijuana first, so people can use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",

            "I mean, initially, I was cool with the whole thing, but I think everyone was still pretty shook up from 9/11, and we kinda went into Iraq on a technicality. I mean, there were these pretexts that they used to get us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration was linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and they said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Spoiler alert: that was all made up.\n\nAnd that just rubbed me the wrong way. The Iraq War just makes me see red. I think the Bush administration flat-out lied to the American people, and they haven’t owned up to it yet. Not even Colin Powell, who presented all that evidence at the UN. Now he says he wasn’t convinced by it. That’s just incompetence, man. It’s an impeachable offense to lie like that. I think the Bush administration has been systematically disrespecting the Constitution since 9/11.\n\nThey came into office with war on their minds. I can't remember the Treasury Secretary's name, but he wrote about it in his book after he was kicked out. But it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad, and he was looking to boost our energy supply. Underhanded, if you ask me.\n\nBut anyway, I think it's gone on long enough. I don't think pulling out now would be a good idea, though. There's a risk the country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The alternative, like what the UN and the US are pushing for—getting countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and restore order—it's not guaranteed to work either. I mean, in the long run, Iraq's sovereignty could become a huge issue. The interim government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much. Prime Minister, who's it again? He doesn't seem to have much control. And we still have radical factions vying for power. It's a mess, man. I can't even articulate it nicely.",

We never declared it a war, so it's more like a reprisal. We thought Iraq did 9/11, so we bombed them. I'm not really into the war, I don't follow it much. I don't know all the details, but I know we're there to build democracy and get oil. But it's not right. We're just making everyone upset. If we stay, we'll have to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us. I don't know, it's hard. I don't know if we should continue the war. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. We don't need to use guns to show we're big and American. We just want to help, but it's a waste of resources. I feel bad for Bush, he's making a big mess. Like Vietnam, it was never a declared war. I don't think it's fair. The war is taking too long, and it's hurting us and them. It's a cycle of destruction.

            "Well,\nTo begin, I don't believe the government was fully honest with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. They tried to link the war to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, making it seem like Iraq was somehow involved, which wasn't truly the case.\n\nNow, I'm not for war, especially preemptive strikes. I think it's a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. The war in Iraq has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a quick, successful stay in Iraq. In reality, it's taken years, and American troops are still dying and training Iraqi forces. It's a complex situation, and the US government didn't plan for all possible outcomes. They made it seem easy, but implementing a new government takes time, as it did in our own country. I believe we should see it through, but at what cost?\n\nThe decision to go into Iraq was difficult, especially considering the large number of American casualties. Why, if the goal is to spread democracy, is it just Iraq? I think it's about oil and controlling resources. The whole weapons of mass destruction argument was unfounded, yet we've taken no action against countries like North Korea that actually have them.\n\nLet's hope it ends soon, but probably not.",
            "Well, let's see here,\nI do support gay marriage, I've always been in favor,\nIt’s a matter of personal preference, right?\nAnd there's evidence that it could be biological, not just societal,\nSo denying people rights over something they can’t control seems inhumane,\nI'm always been an advocate for gay marriage, you know?\nI think politics and government should stay out of it,\nIt's not a state issue, it's a personal and household matter,\nI know in my neighborhood, there's a couple of openly gay couples,\nThey're like any other family, walking dogs and all,\nBut they can't get married because they're not allowed,\nAnd with Bush trying to define marriage his way,\nIt just seems ridiculous,\nIt’s something that's been proven, for instance,\nThere's a chemical component in the brain,\nYou might be predisposed to be homosexual,\nNot just because of your upbringing,\nAnd marriage should be a personal, private affair,\nNot something that's up for public debate,\nI mean, a guy and a girl can elope to Vegas without anyone knowing,\nBut if two guys do the same thing, it's all over the news,\nIt’s not right to make it such a public thing, you know?",

            "&nbsp; I feel like the war has stretched out too long\n&nbsp; Initially, I thought the purpose was noble\n&nbsp; To restore democracy in another country\n&nbsp; But I think we’ve lost sight of that\n&nbsp; Now it feels like we’re just at war to prove our power\n&nbsp; I suspect there were personal reasons\n&nbsp; George Bush’s father had issues with Saddam Hussein\n&nbsp; So if the original aim was to give democracy to a country lacking a fair system, that would be understandable\n&nbsp; But if personal matters were involved, it wouldn’t be fair\n&nbsp; I think we’ve outstayed our welcome\n&nbsp; Our initial purpose was clear in those first few months\n&nbsp; But the conflict has dragged on for years\n&nbsp; I believe our reasons have become muddled\n&nbsp; We seem to be at war just for the sake of it\n&nbsp; We don’t want to leave without a decisive win\n\n&nbsp; I think it’s gone on too long\n&nbsp; Our economy is being drained\n&nbsp; We should focus on our own issues\n&nbsp; Like poverty, infrastructure, healthcare\n&nbsp; We’re spending billions on a war that’s lost its cause\n&nbsp; It’s time to bring our troops home\n&nbsp; The country’s officials need to stand on their own",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nOh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOkay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. I mean, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile, and you might need to be their \"friend.\" But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. I mean, if I think that was actually good—someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost—that's tough. Because obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile or if someone was just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or if they were actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. I don't really know.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once about a man who just tried to prove how easily he could get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your looks sometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue. Because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard that my roommate's high school had an issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like, I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "So, um, we need to talk about the Iraq War one more time. Um, I feel a bit hypocritical discussing it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really crucial anymore. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit their mistake. And um, according to recent polls, seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Even eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of the troops there agree that it was a dumb move and we should pull out within the year. It's been a complete disaster since day one, and pulling out will be just as disastrous. There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. Um, I think it's just a cultural clash between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. The administration thinks they can impose democracy on a people who would never choose it that way. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like quicksand. Um, I don't know what to say about it. I just don't see a reason for us to stay there. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons to stay. I guess I wouldn't mind a gradual pullout over a year or so, but I don't see why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year. And, you know, these are the people we're trying to help. Telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if things go to shit. Um, and at least then, if we decide to help out later, we'd be the good guys. Not really, though, because we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we are now. Um, yeah. Uh, no.",
            "You know, I'm quite convinced that gender discrimination is still a prevalent issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women; it also affects men in certain fields. In general, women face significant hurdles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even when they're qualified for a position, they might not get promoted because historically, women haven't been seen in upper management roles. The situation isn't much different for men either. Take, for instance, the fashion industry. Men aren't taken as seriously, especially if they're straight, because they don't fit the typical male stereotype and might not understand the 'female perspective.' And then there are men who stay at home to raise their children. Society often disapproves of this, viewing it as unmasculine. It's a difficult situation because while these men might prefer to spend time with their children, society often expects men to be the breadwinners. The pace of change is slow, but it's happening. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are becoming accepted. However, it's crucial to promote these changes subtly, letting their positive qualities shine through. Pushing too hard can lead to resistance. We've come a long way, and change takes time. But there's also discrimination based on class, where someone from a rural background might face judgment for their grammar. And sometimes, gender discrimination can be mutual, with men or women looking down on each other. It's a complex issue, and it's not just about gender anymore.",
            "Let me clarify: they didn't legalize it, they decriminalized it. This means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic citation. You'd get a ticket rather than being arrested and booked. And while decriminalizing it mitigates the worst consequences in job interviews or other areas, it doesn't erase the potential future ramifications. However, there's an argument that it saves a lot of money for municipalities on arrests, court cases, and public defenders. It also opens up funds for social programs and public education. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's fine. But out in the open, it's still quite awkward due to society's taboo. I'm not sure about making it like cigarettes, sold everywhere, and smoked while driving. I believe marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyles than decision-making skills, but it's tough to generalize as reactions vary greatly. Both alcohol and marijuana have their effects, but no two people react the same way. It's hard to say whether one is worse than the other.",
            "I would indeed say yes, um, a lot of the things they do are quite traditional, like they've been doing them for ages. It's good to be grounded in tradition, but it's also crucial to be adaptable to change, you know? Um, a lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church every week, and they're quite strict on how things should be done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and it's not very accepting of those who aren't perfect Catholics, or those of other religions. For instance, my mom was Episcopalian, and my dad was Catholic, but they wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of his religion. It's not really about being tolerant of other religions, you know? We always learned to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. A lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do one thing, but the practice often goes against it because it's so outdated. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, like, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily stop them from pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? I mean, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's about children, not spouses. So, if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent those things from happening, I think it would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter. I can’t say for sure who’s right or wrong. But I do think this is the trickiest issue we're facing today. It's like trying to separate the church from the state without offending anyone. And how to define marriage? It’s a tricky business. I mean, if civil unions are just a matter of two people getting together, why can’t the government see it that way? After all, people don’t get tax breaks or any specific treatment if they’re baptized. So, if you’re married, why shouldn’t the government see it as a civil union? That’s what it is – two people united. And gay marriage? Well, if that’s what they have, it’s just another civil union. But if all states can agree on something, then they should push for it to become federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Ridiculous. It’s not a big enough cause to amend the constitution. It’s not important enough. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I have several gay friends, and while I might not condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue, but one that each state should decide on their own terms. After all, there are red states and blue states; naturally, democratic ones are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect its decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be left to the discretion of each state. The president shouldn't dictate the whole country's stance on this matter. I'm not a fan of Bush's ban on gay marriage, and I don't think he has the right to decide how each state should run itself. He won't be in office forever, so why should his term dictate nationwide policy? It's up to each state to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "Well, you see, it's a public space, like Myspace. It's basically a bulletin board for the world to see, not just your friends or your classmates. And if you post something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. School officials can see it, even if it's not under their name, because they have access to it at home too.\n\nNow, when it comes to something like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine for them to monitor it. It's their responsibility to keep the students safe, and if it saves lives, then I think they have the right to do it. But if they're just cruising around looking for students to get into trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. It's not just about what they post, but what they do with that information.\n\nExpressing yourself is a lot easier when you're writing, but it's a public thing. You can't just post something and expect it to be private. Everything you post can come back to haunt you, like emails. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back, and it can get you into trouble.\n\nAs for me, I don't think they should be on the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that could make the school safer, that's fine. It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe place. Teachers and officials have to ensure that, especially with all the drills and lock downs due to terrorism threats. They're just trying to make the school a safer place, like preventing another Columbine.\n\nSo, that's basically it.",
            "&nbsp; Ok &nbsp; Um &nbsp; The war &nbsp; Um &nbsp; At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. &nbsp; I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I do think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. &nbsp; And we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I really think that it backfired on us. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I uh &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; I was all for it, &nbsp; but now I’m very against it. &nbsp; I don’t think it did anything. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. &nbsp; Like I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re if they can’t even get along with themselves. &nbsp; So um &nbsp; Like unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; With those people. &nbsp; I just don’t care. &nbsp; I just think &nbsp; I don’t think that &nbsp; Sometimes I don’t think they’re human. &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; Like they fight with each other and they can’t. &nbsp; They just can’t do anything themselves. &nbsp; So I really don’t care. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; We definitely went over there just unprepared. &nbsp; We didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. &nbsp; They’re just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. &nbsp; I just think they’re looking to get us out of there. &nbsp; And I think that should be fine for us. &nbsp; I think we should just leave and that’s really it. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; We just &nbsp; I think we were just more like &nbsp; Just hyped up than anything. &nbsp; I don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. &nbsp;Um &nbsp; And I just &nbsp; We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; Also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; But at the time, I see where he was coming from. &nbsp; We really &nbsp; I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say \"ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\". &nbsp; So &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we could have let it go. &nbsp; But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do. &nbsp; I don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order. &nbsp; And I don’t know. &nbsp; I just think that they didn’t &nbsp; There was no like unity. &nbsp; They didn’t know what they were going in there for. &nbsp; So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. &nbsp; But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. &nbsp; So that’s what we created in turn in there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And &nbsp; Honestly, I don’t &nbsp; I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. &nbsp; I honestly think they’re always going to be like that. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I don’t &nbsp; I really don’t have anything else to say. &nbsp; It’s gone on definitely long enough. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we’re making enough progress. &nbsp; Like we’ve made progress, &nbsp; But not enough to stay in there. &nbsp; And I think no matter how long we stay in there, &nbsp; Once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. &nbsp; And we can’t stay over there forever. &nbsp; So I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. &nbsp; No. &nbsp; Ok"

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon, in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to adapt. They've been grappling with their declining membership, and I believe it's because they're not very welcoming to a lot of contemporary views, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stances are quite conservative, and I think if they loosened up a bit, they'd retain more followers. I've heard plenty of folks steering away from the Church due to their rigid views on these topics. People these days don't align with their stance on these issues, so they're starting to turn their backs. For instance, if you're pro-choice, you might not want to be part of a community that deems abortion wrong. The same goes for those who support gay marriage. I can't see why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented the recent scandals. They might have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women in the priesthood, but it's hard to say for sure. I mean, aren't priests supposed to be devoted to their work and their families just like everyone else?",

            "Alright, so I spend the summer bustling in a hospital pharmacy. You know, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its uses. It's all about striking a balance. Sure, I'd say no to making it widely available to the public. No way. But for medicinal purposes? Absolutely, yes. It's about the benefits, not the stigma. Yeah, there are plenty of controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percoets, and we use them all the time because they're beneficial and effective. If you deny their worth just because there's a negative stigma around marijuana, that's a waste of time for me. You need to embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol, though both can be abused. It's a tough one. I'd suggest gradually integrating it, removing the taboo around it first, then letting it become legal. But if you just legalize it all at once, it'll likely be abused. You gotta remove that negative image of marijuana first, so people can use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",

            "I mean, initially, I was cool with the whole thing, but I think everyone was still pretty shook up from 9/11, and we kinda went into Iraq on a technicality. I mean, there were these pretexts that they used to get us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration was linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and they said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Spoiler alert: that was all made up.\n\nAnd that just rubbed me the wrong way. The Iraq War just makes me see red. I think the Bush administration flat-out lied to the American people, and they haven’t owned up to it yet. Not even Colin Powell, who presented all that evidence at the UN. Now he says he wasn’t convinced by it. That’s just incompetence, man. It’s an impeachable offense to lie like that. I think the Bush administration has been systematically disrespecting the Constitution since 9/11.\n\nThey came into office with war on their minds. I can't remember the Treasury Secretary's name, but he wrote about it in his book after he was kicked out. But it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad, and he was looking to boost our energy supply. Underhanded, if you ask me.\n\nBut anyway, I think it's gone on long enough. I don't think pulling out now would be a good idea, though. There's a risk the country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The alternative, like what the UN and the US are pushing for—getting countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and restore order—it's not guaranteed to work either. I mean, in the long run, Iraq's sovereignty could become a huge issue. The interim government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much. Prime Minister, who's it again? He doesn't seem to have much control. And we still have radical factions vying for power. It's a mess, man. I can't even articulate it nicely.",

We never declared it a war, so it's more like a reprisal. We thought Iraq did 9/11, so we bombed them. I'm not really into the war, I don't follow it much. I don't know all the details, but I know we're there to build democracy and get oil. But it's not right. We're just making everyone upset. If we stay, we'll have to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us. I don't know, it's hard. I don't know if we should continue the war. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. We don't need to use guns to show we're big and American. We just want to help, but it's a waste of resources. I feel bad for Bush, he's making a big mess. Like Vietnam, it was never a declared war. I don't think it's fair. The war is taking too long, and it's hurting us and them. It's a cycle of destruction.

            "Well,\nTo begin, I don't believe the government was fully honest with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. They tried to link the war to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, making it seem like Iraq was somehow involved, which wasn't truly the case.\n\nNow, I'm not for war, especially preemptive strikes. I think it's a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. The war in Iraq has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a quick, successful stay in Iraq. In reality, it's taken years, and American troops are still dying and training Iraqi forces. It's a complex situation, and the US government didn't plan for all possible outcomes. They made it seem easy, but implementing a new government takes time, as it did in our own country. I believe we should see it through, but at what cost?\n\nThe decision to go into Iraq was difficult, especially considering the large number of American casualties. Why, if the goal is to spread democracy, is it just Iraq? I think it's about oil and controlling resources. The whole weapons of mass destruction argument was unfounded, yet we've taken no action against countries like North Korea that actually have them.\n\nLet's hope it ends soon, but probably not.",
            "Well, let's see here,\nI do support gay marriage, I've always been in favor,\nIt’s a matter of personal preference, right?\nAnd there's evidence that it could be biological, not just societal,\nSo denying people rights over something they can’t control seems inhumane,\nI'm always been an advocate for gay marriage, you know?\nI think politics and government should stay out of it,\nIt's not a state issue, it's a personal and household matter,\nI know in my neighborhood, there's a couple of openly gay couples,\nThey're like any other family, walking dogs and all,\nBut they can't get married because they're not allowed,\nAnd with Bush trying to define marriage his way,\nIt just seems ridiculous,\nIt’s something that's been proven, for instance,\nThere's a chemical component in the brain,\nYou might be predisposed to be homosexual,\nNot just because of your upbringing,\nAnd marriage should be a personal, private affair,\nNot something that's up for public debate,\nI mean, a guy and a girl can elope to Vegas without anyone knowing,\nBut if two guys do the same thing, it's all over the news,\nIt’s not right to make it such a public thing, you know?",

            "&nbsp; I feel like the war has stretched out too long\n&nbsp; Initially, I thought the purpose was noble\n&nbsp; To restore democracy in another country\n&nbsp; But I think we’ve lost sight of that\n&nbsp; Now it feels like we’re just at war to prove our power\n&nbsp; I suspect there were personal reasons\n&nbsp; George Bush’s father had issues with Saddam Hussein\n&nbsp; So if the original aim was to give democracy to a country lacking a fair system, that would be understandable\n&nbsp; But if personal matters were involved, it wouldn’t be fair\n&nbsp; I think we’ve outstayed our welcome\n&nbsp; Our initial purpose was clear in those first few months\n&nbsp; But the conflict has dragged on for years\n&nbsp; I believe our reasons have become muddled\n&nbsp; We seem to be at war just for the sake of it\n&nbsp; We don’t want to leave without a decisive win\n\n&nbsp; I think it’s gone on too long\n&nbsp; Our economy is being drained\n&nbsp; We should focus on our own issues\n&nbsp; Like poverty, infrastructure, healthcare\n&nbsp; We’re spending billions on a war that’s lost its cause\n&nbsp; It’s time to bring our troops home\n&nbsp; The country’s officials need to stand on their own",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nOh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOkay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. I mean, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile, and you might need to be their \"friend.\" But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. I mean, if I think that was actually good—someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost—that's tough. Because obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile or if someone was just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or if they were actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. I don't really know.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once about a man who just tried to prove how easily he could get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your looks sometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue. Because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard that my roommate's high school had an issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like, I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "So, um, we need to talk about the Iraq War one more time. Um, I feel a bit hypocritical discussing it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really crucial anymore. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit their mistake. And um, according to recent polls, seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Even eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of the troops there agree that it was a dumb move and we should pull out within the year. It's been a complete disaster since day one, and pulling out will be just as disastrous. There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. Um, I think it's just a cultural clash between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. The administration thinks they can impose democracy on a people who would never choose it that way. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like quicksand. Um, I don't know what to say about it. I just don't see a reason for us to stay there. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons to stay. I guess I wouldn't mind a gradual pullout over a year or so, but I don't see why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year. And, you know, these are the people we're trying to help. Telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if things go to shit. Um, and at least then, if we decide to help out later, we'd be the good guys. Not really, though, because we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we are now. Um, yeah. Uh, no.",
            "You know, I'm quite convinced that gender discrimination is still a prevalent issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women; it also affects men in certain fields. In general, women face significant hurdles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even when they're qualified for a position, they might not get promoted because historically, women haven't been seen in upper management roles. The situation isn't much different for men either. Take, for instance, the fashion industry. Men aren't taken as seriously, especially if they're straight, because they don't fit the typical male stereotype and might not understand the 'female perspective.' And then there are men who stay at home to raise their children. Society often disapproves of this, viewing it as unmasculine. It's a difficult situation because while these men might prefer to spend time with their children, society often expects men to be the breadwinners. The pace of change is slow, but it's happening. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are becoming accepted. However, it's crucial to promote these changes subtly, letting their positive qualities shine through. Pushing too hard can lead to resistance. We've come a long way, and change takes time. But there's also discrimination based on class, where someone from a rural background might face judgment for their grammar. And sometimes, gender discrimination can be mutual, with men or women looking down on each other. It's a complex issue, and it's not just about gender anymore.",
            "Let me clarify: they didn't legalize it, they decriminalized it. This means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic citation. You'd get a ticket rather than being arrested and booked. And while decriminalizing it mitigates the worst consequences in job interviews or other areas, it doesn't erase the potential future ramifications. However, there's an argument that it saves a lot of money for municipalities on arrests, court cases, and public defenders. It also opens up funds for social programs and public education. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's fine. But out in the open, it's still quite awkward due to society's taboo. I'm not sure about making it like cigarettes, sold everywhere, and smoked while driving. I believe marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyles than decision-making skills, but it's tough to generalize as reactions vary greatly. Both alcohol and marijuana have their effects, but no two people react the same way. It's hard to say whether one is worse than the other.",
            "I would indeed say yes, um, a lot of the things they do are quite traditional, like they've been doing them for ages. It's good to be grounded in tradition, but it's also crucial to be adaptable to change, you know? Um, a lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church every week, and they're quite strict on how things should be done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and it's not very accepting of those who aren't perfect Catholics, or those of other religions. For instance, my mom was Episcopalian, and my dad was Catholic, but they wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of his religion. It's not really about being tolerant of other religions, you know? We always learned to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. A lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do one thing, but the practice often goes against it because it's so outdated. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, like, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily stop them from pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? I mean, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's about children, not spouses. So, if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent those things from happening, I think it would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter. I can’t say for sure who’s right or wrong. But I do think this is the trickiest issue we're facing today. It's like trying to separate the church from the state without offending anyone. And how to define marriage? It’s a tricky business. I mean, if civil unions are just a matter of two people getting together, why can’t the government see it that way? After all, people don’t get tax breaks or any specific treatment if they’re baptized. So, if you’re married, why shouldn’t the government see it as a civil union? That’s what it is – two people united. And gay marriage? Well, if that’s what they have, it’s just another civil union. But if all states can agree on something, then they should push for it to become federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Ridiculous. It’s not a big enough cause to amend the constitution. It’s not important enough. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I have several gay friends, and while I might not condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue, but one that each state should decide on their own terms. After all, there are red states and blue states; naturally, democratic ones are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect its decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be left to the discretion of each state. The president shouldn't dictate the whole country's stance on this matter. I'm not a fan of Bush's ban on gay marriage, and I don't think he has the right to decide how each state should run itself. He won't be in office forever, so why should his term dictate nationwide policy? It's up to each state to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "Well, you see, it's a public space, like Myspace. It's basically a bulletin board for the world to see, not just your friends or your classmates. And if you post something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. School officials can see it, even if it's not under their name, because they have access to it at home too.\n\nNow, when it comes to something like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine for them to monitor it. It's their responsibility to keep the students safe, and if it saves lives, then I think they have the right to do it. But if they're just cruising around looking for students to get into trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. It's not just about what they post, but what they do with that information.\n\nExpressing yourself is a lot easier when you're writing, but it's a public thing. You can't just post something and expect it to be private. Everything you post can come back to haunt you, like emails. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back, and it can get you into trouble.\n\nAs for me, I don't think they should be on the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that could make the school safer, that's fine. It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe place. Teachers and officials have to ensure that, especially with all the drills and lock downs due to terrorism threats. They're just trying to make the school a safer place, like preventing another Columbine.\n\nSo, that's basically it.",
            "&nbsp; Ok &nbsp; Um &nbsp; The war &nbsp; Um &nbsp; At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. &nbsp; I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I do think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. &nbsp; And we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I really think that it backfired on us. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I uh &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; I was all for it, &nbsp; but now I’m very against it. &nbsp; I don’t think it did anything. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. &nbsp; Like I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re if they can’t even get along with themselves. &nbsp; So um &nbsp; Like unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; With those people. &nbsp; I just don’t care. &nbsp; I just think &nbsp; I don’t think that &nbsp; Sometimes I don’t think they’re human. &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; Like they fight with each other and they can’t. &nbsp; They just can’t do anything themselves. &nbsp; So I really don’t care. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; We definitely went over there just unprepared. &nbsp; We didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. &nbsp; They’re just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. &nbsp; I just think they’re looking to get us out of there. &nbsp; And I think that should be fine for us. &nbsp; I think we should just leave and that’s really it. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; We just &nbsp; I think we were just more like &nbsp; Just hyped up than anything. &nbsp; I don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. &nbsp;Um &nbsp; And I just &nbsp; We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; Also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; But at the time, I see where he was coming from. &nbsp; We really &nbsp; I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say \"ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\". &nbsp; So &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we could have let it go. &nbsp; But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do. &nbsp; I don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order. &nbsp; And I don’t know. &nbsp; I just think that they didn’t &nbsp; There was no like unity. &nbsp; They didn’t know what they were going in there for. &nbsp; So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. &nbsp; But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. &nbsp; So that’s what we created in turn in there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And &nbsp; Honestly, I don’t &nbsp; I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. &nbsp; I honestly think they’re always going to be like that. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I don’t &nbsp; I really don’t have anything else to say. &nbsp; It’s gone on definitely long enough. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we’re making enough progress. &nbsp; Like we’ve made progress, &nbsp; But not enough to stay in there. &nbsp; And I think no matter how long we stay in there, &nbsp; Once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. &nbsp; And we can’t stay over there forever. &nbsp; So I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. &nbsp; No. &nbsp; Ok"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon, in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to adapt. They've been grappling with their declining membership, and I believe it's because they're not very welcoming to a lot of contemporary views, like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stances are quite conservative, and I think if they loosened up a bit, they'd retain more followers. I've heard plenty of folks steering away from the Church due to their rigid views on these topics. People these days don't align with their stance on these issues, so they're starting to turn their backs. For instance, if you're pro-choice, you might not want to be part of a community that deems abortion wrong. The same goes for those who support gay marriage. I can't see why priests can't be married or have female priests, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented the recent scandals. They might have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women in the priesthood, but it's hard to say for sure. I mean, aren't priests supposed to be devoted to their work and their families just like everyone else?",

            "Alright, so I spend the summer bustling in a hospital pharmacy. You know, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its uses. It's all about striking a balance. Sure, I'd say no to making it widely available to the public. No way. But for medicinal purposes? Absolutely, yes. It's about the benefits, not the stigma. Yeah, there are plenty of controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percoets, and we use them all the time because they're beneficial and effective. If you deny their worth just because there's a negative stigma around marijuana, that's a waste of time for me. You need to embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol, though both can be abused. It's a tough one. I'd suggest gradually integrating it, removing the taboo around it first, then letting it become legal. But if you just legalize it all at once, it'll likely be abused. You gotta remove that negative image of marijuana first, so people can use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",

            "I mean, initially, I was cool with the whole thing, but I think everyone was still pretty shook up from 9/11, and we kinda went into Iraq on a technicality. I mean, there were these pretexts that they used to get us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration was linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and they said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Spoiler alert: that was all made up.\n\nAnd that just rubbed me the wrong way. The Iraq War just makes me see red. I think the Bush administration flat-out lied to the American people, and they haven’t owned up to it yet. Not even Colin Powell, who presented all that evidence at the UN. Now he says he wasn’t convinced by it. That’s just incompetence, man. It’s an impeachable offense to lie like that. I think the Bush administration has been systematically disrespecting the Constitution since 9/11.\n\nThey came into office with war on their minds. I can't remember the Treasury Secretary's name, but he wrote about it in his book after he was kicked out. But it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad, and he was looking to boost our energy supply. Underhanded, if you ask me.\n\nBut anyway, I think it's gone on long enough. I don't think pulling out now would be a good idea, though. There's a risk the country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The alternative, like what the UN and the US are pushing for—getting countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and restore order—it's not guaranteed to work either. I mean, in the long run, Iraq's sovereignty could become a huge issue. The interim government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much. Prime Minister, who's it again? He doesn't seem to have much control. And we still have radical factions vying for power. It's a mess, man. I can't even articulate it nicely.",

If we stay, we'll have to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us. I don't know, it's hard. I don't know if we should continue the war. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. We don't need to use guns to show we're big and American. We just want to help, but it's a waste of resources. I feel bad for Bush, he's making a big mess. Like Vietnam, it was never a declared war. I don't think it's fair. The war is taking too long, and it's hurting us and them. It's a cycle of destruction. I don't want it to end because of the families involved. But I don't want to impose our culture on them. It's going to make things worse. I think this is going to go on for years. That's it. Ok.",
            "&nbsp;  i don't feel quite right about this.  it's not my place to make it legal or for a state to declare it as such  i believe it's up to the churches.  the constitution even spells it out: separation of church and state  i think trying to enforce it would be against what's already written in stone  and the people pushing for it, i think it's choosing one church's belief over another  most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few places like Boston  i don't think it's up to the government to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal or legal  &nbsp;  separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution and our religious tolerance here  and making an amendment about it would be wrong, contradicting what's already there  and it's one of the few amendments that could restrict people, not the government  so i don't feel it's right  &nbsp;  no, i don't think the federal government or any government should be involved.  it's his personal beliefs as a Catholic, pushing for this amendment  it's showing a preference for his religion over others  i think it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official  and there's no reason behind it other than personal views  it might even boost society, i don't know how, but i think it could be better than not doing it  &nbsp;  um, i think i've said it all  &nbsp;",
            "Well,\nTo begin, I don't believe the government was fully honest with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. They tried to link the war to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, making it seem like Iraq was somehow involved, which wasn't truly the case.\n\nNow, I'm not for war, especially preemptive strikes. I think it's a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. The war in Iraq has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implant a democratic one, similar to their efforts in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process.\n\nThe government made it seem like it would be a quick, successful stay in Iraq. In reality, it's taken years, and American troops are still dying and training Iraqi forces. It's a complex situation, and the US government didn't plan for all possible outcomes. They made it seem easy, but implementing a new government takes time, as it did in our own country. I believe we should see it through, but at what cost?\n\nThe decision to go into Iraq was difficult, especially considering the large number of American casualties. Why, if the goal is to spread democracy, is it just Iraq? I think it's about oil and controlling resources. The whole weapons of mass destruction argument was unfounded, yet we've taken no action against countries like North Korea that actually have them.\n\nLet's hope it ends soon, but probably not.",

            "&nbsp; I feel like the war has stretched out too long\n&nbsp; Initially, I thought the purpose was noble\n&nbsp; To restore democracy in another country\n&nbsp; But I think we’ve lost sight of that\n&nbsp; Now it feels like we’re just at war to prove our power\n&nbsp; I suspect there were personal reasons\n&nbsp; George Bush’s father had issues with Saddam Hussein\n&nbsp; So if the original aim was to give democracy to a country lacking a fair system, that would be understandable\n&nbsp; But if personal matters were involved, it wouldn’t be fair\n&nbsp; I think we’ve outstayed our welcome\n&nbsp; Our initial purpose was clear in those first few months\n&nbsp; But the conflict has dragged on for years\n&nbsp; I believe our reasons have become muddled\n&nbsp; We seem to be at war just for the sake of it\n&nbsp; We don’t want to leave without a decisive win\n\n&nbsp; I think it’s gone on too long\n&nbsp; Our economy is being drained\n&nbsp; We should focus on our own issues\n&nbsp; Like poverty, infrastructure, healthcare\n&nbsp; We’re spending billions on a war that’s lost its cause\n&nbsp; It’s time to bring our troops home\n&nbsp; The country’s officials need to stand on their own",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nOh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOkay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. I mean, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile, and you might need to be their \"friend.\" But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. I mean, if I think that was actually good—someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost—that's tough. Because obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile or if someone was just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or if they were actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. I don't really know.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once about a man who just tried to prove how easily he could get information. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, your looks sometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue. Because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard that my roommate's high school had an issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like, I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "So, um, we need to talk about the Iraq War one more time. Um, I feel a bit hypocritical discussing it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really crucial anymore. The general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit their mistake. And um, according to recent polls, seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Even eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of the troops there agree that it was a dumb move and we should pull out within the year. It's been a complete disaster since day one, and pulling out will be just as disastrous. There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East. Um, I think it's just a cultural clash between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. The administration thinks they can impose democracy on a people who would never choose it that way. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster. It's like quicksand. Um, I don't know what to say about it. I just don't see a reason for us to stay there. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons to stay. I guess I wouldn't mind a gradual pullout over a year or so, but I don't see why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year. And, you know, these are the people we're trying to help. Telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if things go to shit. Um, and at least then, if we decide to help out later, we'd be the good guys. Not really, though, because we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we are now. Um, yeah. Uh, no.",
            "You know, I'm quite convinced that gender discrimination is still a prevalent issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women; it also affects men in certain fields. In general, women face significant hurdles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even when they're qualified for a position, they might not get promoted because historically, women haven't been seen in upper management roles. The situation isn't much different for men either. Take, for instance, the fashion industry. Men aren't taken as seriously, especially if they're straight, because they don't fit the typical male stereotype and might not understand the 'female perspective.' And then there are men who stay at home to raise their children. Society often disapproves of this, viewing it as unmasculine. It's a difficult situation because while these men might prefer to spend time with their children, society often expects men to be the breadwinners. The pace of change is slow, but it's happening. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are becoming accepted. However, it's crucial to promote these changes subtly, letting their positive qualities shine through. Pushing too hard can lead to resistance. We've come a long way, and change takes time. But there's also discrimination based on class, where someone from a rural background might face judgment for their grammar. And sometimes, gender discrimination can be mutual, with men or women looking down on each other. It's a complex issue, and it's not just about gender anymore.",
            "Let me clarify: they didn't legalize it, they decriminalized it. This means it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic citation. You'd get a ticket rather than being arrested and booked. And while decriminalizing it mitigates the worst consequences in job interviews or other areas, it doesn't erase the potential future ramifications. However, there's an argument that it saves a lot of money for municipalities on arrests, court cases, and public defenders. It also opens up funds for social programs and public education. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's fine. But out in the open, it's still quite awkward due to society's taboo. I'm not sure about making it like cigarettes, sold everywhere, and smoked while driving. I believe marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyles than decision-making skills, but it's tough to generalize as reactions vary greatly. Both alcohol and marijuana have their effects, but no two people react the same way. It's hard to say whether one is worse than the other.",
            "I would indeed say yes, um, a lot of the things they do are quite traditional, like they've been doing them for ages. It's good to be grounded in tradition, but it's also crucial to be adaptable to change, you know? Um, a lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church every week, and they're quite strict on how things should be done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and it's not very accepting of those who aren't perfect Catholics, or those of other religions. For instance, my mom was Episcopalian, and my dad was Catholic, but they wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of his religion. It's not really about being tolerant of other religions, you know? We always learned to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. A lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do one thing, but the practice often goes against it because it's so outdated. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, like, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily stop them from pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? I mean, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's about children, not spouses. So, if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether you're married or not. I don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent those things from happening, I think it would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter. I can’t say for sure who’s right or wrong. But I do think this is the trickiest issue we're facing today. It's like trying to separate the church from the state without offending anyone. And how to define marriage? It’s a tricky business. I mean, if civil unions are just a matter of two people getting together, why can’t the government see it that way? After all, people don’t get tax breaks or any specific treatment if they’re baptized. So, if you’re married, why shouldn’t the government see it as a civil union? That’s what it is – two people united. And gay marriage? Well, if that’s what they have, it’s just another civil union. But if all states can agree on something, then they should push for it to become federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Ridiculous. It’s not a big enough cause to amend the constitution. It’s not important enough. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I have several gay friends, and while I might not condone their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a national issue, but one that each state should decide on their own terms. After all, there are red states and blue states; naturally, democratic ones are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect its decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be left to the discretion of each state. The president shouldn't dictate the whole country's stance on this matter. I'm not a fan of Bush's ban on gay marriage, and I don't think he has the right to decide how each state should run itself. He won't be in office forever, so why should his term dictate nationwide policy? It's up to each state to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "Well, you see, it's a public space, like Myspace. It's basically a bulletin board for the world to see, not just your friends or your classmates. And if you post something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. School officials can see it, even if it's not under their name, because they have access to it at home too.\n\nNow, when it comes to something like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine for them to monitor it. It's their responsibility to keep the students safe, and if it saves lives, then I think they have the right to do it. But if they're just cruising around looking for students to get into trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. It's not just about what they post, but what they do with that information.\n\nExpressing yourself is a lot easier when you're writing, but it's a public thing. You can't just post something and expect it to be private. Everything you post can come back to haunt you, like emails. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back, and it can get you into trouble.\n\nAs for me, I don't think they should be on the internet just to catch students. But if they find something that could make the school safer, that's fine. It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe place. Teachers and officials have to ensure that, especially with all the drills and lock downs due to terrorism threats. They're just trying to make the school a safer place, like preventing another Columbine.\n\nSo, that's basically it.",
            "&nbsp; Ok &nbsp; Um &nbsp; The war &nbsp; Um &nbsp; At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. &nbsp; I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I do think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. &nbsp; And we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I really think that it backfired on us. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I uh &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; I was all for it, &nbsp; but now I’m very against it. &nbsp; I don’t think it did anything. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. &nbsp; Like I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re if they can’t even get along with themselves. &nbsp; So um &nbsp; Like unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; With those people. &nbsp; I just don’t care. &nbsp; I just think &nbsp; I don’t think that &nbsp; Sometimes I don’t think they’re human. &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; Like they fight with each other and they can’t. &nbsp; They just can’t do anything themselves. &nbsp; So I really don’t care. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t know. &nbsp; We definitely went over there just unprepared. &nbsp; We didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. &nbsp; They’re just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. &nbsp; I just think they’re looking to get us out of there. &nbsp; And I think that should be fine for us. &nbsp; I think we should just leave and that’s really it. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; We just &nbsp; I think we were just more like &nbsp; Just hyped up than anything. &nbsp; I don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. &nbsp;Um &nbsp; And I just &nbsp; We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; Also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; But at the time, I see where he was coming from. &nbsp; We really &nbsp; I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say \"ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\". &nbsp; So &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we could have let it go. &nbsp; But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do. &nbsp; I don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order. &nbsp; And I don’t know. &nbsp; I just think that they didn’t &nbsp; There was no like unity. &nbsp; They didn’t know what they were going in there for. &nbsp; So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. &nbsp; But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. &nbsp; So that’s what we created in turn in there. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; And &nbsp; Honestly, I don’t &nbsp; I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. &nbsp; I honestly think they’re always going to be like that. &nbsp; And um &nbsp; I don’t &nbsp; I really don’t have anything else to say. &nbsp; It’s gone on definitely long enough. &nbsp; Um &nbsp; I don’t think we’re making enough progress. &nbsp; Like we’ve made progress, &nbsp; But not enough to stay in there. &nbsp; And I think no matter how long we stay in there, &nbsp; Once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. &nbsp; And we can’t stay over there forever. &nbsp; So I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. &nbsp; No. &nbsp; Ok"
