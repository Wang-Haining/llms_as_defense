            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage, you know. I mean, who am I to judge? Whether someone is born that way, or whatever, I don't think it's something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can marry, but not two people of the same sex. That's wrong, in my opinion. I haven't really given the topic much thought, but I'd say that's just not right. It's not a choice, like they don't have a say in how they are. I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It doesn't seem like a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, or even a moral one. It's not about our country's security or anything like that. It's just that they're out of place when they try to interject in people's lives. And that's just who they are. It's like their birthright, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's all I have to say about that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Why? Well, let me put it simply, there's no compelling reason not to. Some people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but it's just not that straightforward. Truth be told, there are so many different aspects to this issue that it's foolish to compare it to anything else. It's like two sides of the same coin, no matter how much you try to flip it, they're still the same face. It's not like one is heads and the other tails, they're just different sides of the same reality. And there are so many civil rights implications at play here, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or be by your side in your time of need, because they're not technically family. I mean, if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone, it seems silly to deny them that right. Plus, scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same success rates as heterosexual couples in terms of relationship satisfaction. It's just a relationship, plain and simple. And let's not forget, the people who want to get married aren't asking for the religious sanctification of their union. They just want a legal document that recognizes their commitment, a marriage certificate. If there's no religious involvement, then how can that be an issue? I can't comprehend why people like Catholics would object to this based on their religious beliefs, especially when they're not even directly involved. If you're allowing civil unions, then why not allow marriage? It's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. Homosexual relationships are no different in terms of community involvement or parenting skills. Children of gay couples are just as well-adjusted as children of heterosexual couples. And the federal government should be at the forefront of this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. But, of course, President Bush has his own strong views on this matter, much like his stance on abortion and stem cell research. He seems to be driven by moral reasons, but morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not enforce the morality of one group while ignoring the rest. It's hypocritical to let laws be made that enforce religious standards on everyone, especially considering the recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not accurate. The American Psychological Association has stated this is untrue. If only people listened to institutions that do actual research instead of relying on popular opinion or their local community's beliefs.",
            "Now, let me start by saying that I happen to be working at a hospital pharmacy this summer. And while it's true that not all illegal drugs are beneficial, there's a certain irony in that. You see, the very fact that something is illegal doesn't mean it lacks use, especially in the medical field. I'm talking about opioids like oxycodone, vicodin, percocets—you name it. They're controlled substances because they have their benefits, yet we use them all the time. And the thing about marijuana, well, it's not the same as alcohol. While both can be abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, is a different beast. I believe you could gradually make it legal, but first, you've got to remove that taboo around marijuana. Too many people have a skewed image of it, thinking it's as harmful as heroin or cocaine. But I'm telling you, it's not. If we can get past that image, people might start using it responsibly, and certainly for medicinal purposes. But right now, with that stigma? It's a no-go.",
            "So, I'm of the opinion that the church has subtly adapted to the 21st century, but it ain't as rigid as it used to be. Growing up, it was all about Sunday mass, with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses. I'd see most of my private school friends there on weekends. But now, it's different. They've introduced a 'teenage mass,' cutting it down to 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, even in their beachwear. Families are coming in late, and at morning masses, you see folks in jeans and khakis. It's more relaxed, but I'm not aware of the church's politics, so that's all I've got. As for the accusations against Catholic priests, I think it's a matter of individual choice and genetics. Marriage, for them or any other faith, wouldn't change that. The problem's in the genes, not in the church's rules or lack thereof. The church could've done more to address this, but I don't think it's entirely their fault.",
            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the whole thing, but it seems everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we seem to have entered Iraq as a pretext. There were several pretexts that led us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really grinds my gears. It just seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, coming back from his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nTo me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well, since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm\nI forget the name of\nUm\nthe secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance sort of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too. Which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell\nI do think it’s gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting less than a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.

            "Oh\nI really don’t feel like\nIt’s right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in our constitution, it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s crystal clear\nIt’s crystal clear\nOh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in our constitution\nSo\nOh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one church’s belief over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics\nOh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it, except for up in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nOh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nOh\nLike been a key aspect of our constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradiction to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nOh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think that the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to tie the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really didn’t have much to do with each other\nBut the government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage against the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003\nI myself am against war, especially making a preemptive strike. I was against that\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War\nThe government should have learned from past mistakes\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died\nAnd I don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government\nUm\nAnd the United States is trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what happened in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy\nAnd it was a similar thing with Iraq\nI think the government should have known it would be a long and hard ordeal, not a clear victory like what was hoped for\nUm\nI think the government wasn’t prepared for the insurgents that would rise up\nFighting specific citizens and not a real army\nI think the government should have planned better\nI mean, we’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still dying\nAnd trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces\nIt’s a long process and I think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay\nI mean, democracy takes years to implement and become successful\nAnd I think the government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nUm\nSo\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, it’s a difficult decision to make\nI mean, once you go in there and we’ve been there for so long, how can we abandon these people\nWe’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life\nSo it’s probably something we should see to its finish, but then there’s also the consideration of the American casualties\nHow much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq\nUm\nGoing back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we’re invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why isn’t it just Iraq\nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries\nI think the big reason for that is the oil issue,\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nUm\nAnother pretext was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found\nYet, places like North Korea, which we know has weapons of mass destruction, we’re not attacking\nI don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not",
            "Alright, let me see, I'm really for gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. So, denying people rights based on something they have no control over seems kind of inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this. It's not even something that should be on a state level; it's a personal, household level. My neighborhood, for instance, has two or three openly gay couples living there, not married because they're not allowed to. But they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else. And with Bush trying to play God and interpret marriage the way he wants, it's just ridiculous.\n\nI mean, I think it's something that's been proven to be a biological predisposition. I've read and heard from numerous publications that it's something you might be predisposed to being a homosexual, not something that's solely sociological. Like growing up with lots of sisters and a single father could influence it, but it's not the only factor.\n\nBut other than the obvious, I think maybe it's because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can just run off to Las Vegas and do it without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal, private thing, not something in the public domain or national and federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "Listen, putting stuff online is public. People can see it, and it can color their opinions of you. If you're talking about harmful stuff, like wanting to blow something up or shoot someone, someone's gonna notice. The internet is a huge public forum, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. The school isn't the one who got the warning, someone else did. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have prevented it. But sometimes, people just mess around, and you don't know what to take seriously. Like that time at school; something happened, and someone overheard someone else saying something, then called it in. When they found out who said it, they checked their Facebook, and it turned out they were just joking. But in that situation, it became serious. When you put something out there, it's not private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. I don't think school officials should friend their students on social media and snoop around. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no privacy issue because it's something they were given access to. If there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend students. That's not appropriate. I wouldn't want to see my residents' wild nights out on Facebook, not because I care, but because it's not my business. It's not my place to know or to act on it. I respect their privacy, and I don't need that connection.",
            "Um, I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now, it's just about proving our global dominance, and maybe even settling old scores. George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein might have played a role. If the original intent was to give a fair political system to a country under a tyrant, it was a just cause. But over time, I think our objectives have become murky, like we're still at war just to prove we can be at war. We're not ready to admit defeat, and we're spending billions of dollars on a war that's gone on too long. We've been neglecting our own economy, our own citizens' well-being, and it's not sustainable. I mean, they're spending billions and billions, and there are more pressing issues at home, like poverty and infrastructure, that we should be funding instead. Right now, that money is being spent on a war that's lost its cause. I think it's time to step back and let the locals handle it.",
            "Can I clarify something? You know, I've heard that someone went online and found something that... well, it's hard to put into words.\n\nOkay, so just to make sure I understand, you're saying that what happened wasn't an invasion of privacy?\n\nRight. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available to anyone. You have to have a friend's permission to see someone's profile, but that's their choice. If they've accepted you as a friend, you're giving them permission to see what you're sharing.\n\nI mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you're essentially opening yourself up to a wider audience. And if I'm being honest, I think that's a bit unnerving.\n\nIt's tough, you know? You can't realistically have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something like this. But then again, if it's a case of the school or authorities looking at certain profiles, that could be a bit unfair. It could feel like they're singling out specific students.\n\nI don't know, though. It depends on the situation. Maybe they were looking for evidence of something, or maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to stumble upon something.\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are people out there who can find out a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in just a few minutes. That's a bit scary.\n\nI don't think I'd meet up with someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize but they know who I am from my IM. It's hard because I have to think about my interests, my schedule, even who I'm friends with. It's a tricky balance, you know? I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking.\n\nMy roommate told me that in high school, some schools actually banned students from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the power to do that.\n\nI don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I don't think they had the right to tell people they couldn't have Myspace.",

            "Um\nYeah, I do feel gender discrimination is still notably prevalent in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just with women, although they seem to bear the brunt of it\nUm\nI mean, overall, I believe women have it tougher due to the glass ceiling, where even though we're supposed to be equal, there's a lot of resistance to having a woman in a leadership role, especially if they're in a traditionally male-dominated field\nI guess the same goes for men too, like in fashion\nUm\nAnd being a stay-at-home dad\nIt's still quite unusual\nUm\nSociety often looks down on that because they assume the male should be the breadwinner\nAnd if a woman has a better job, they might find it hard to understand why the male isn't working\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight\nI don't know if that makes sense, but it’s because guys in fashion often have a different lifestyle\nUm\nSo if you're a typical man in fashion, people might think you don't really understand fashion because you're a man\nAnd they might think you don't understand a woman's perspective, like other women do\nUm\nSo, depending on the field of work, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is quite challenging because society is so set in its ways\nWe've certainly come far since the 1800s, but change happens slowly\nUm\nIf we keep working at this pace, where women are climbing higher in the business world and becoming CEOs, people are starting to accept it more\nAnd the same goes for stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the female is the better earner or that she wants to work\nUm\nAnd in fashion too, people start to realize that maybe guys are listening to their female friends or wives\nSo they start to understand where men are coming from\nSo, I guess you kinda have to promote the positive qualities of the stereotypically discriminated against without being too pushy\nUm\nBut just by highlighting their qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nUm\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to happen naturally\nUm\nSo, I don't think there's much more we can do right now because we've come so far, and change takes time\nUm\nWell, I guess people also discriminate against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't great, but you're really intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job\nOther men might look down on you because they think you're not as credible if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nUm\nSo, yeah, sometimes where you're from can discriminate against you\nUm\nAnd it's not just gender, but also within genders\nUm\nI don't know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nSo not really",
            "You see, they didn’t legalize it, no, not by a long shot. They decriminalized it, yeah. That means they knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—you know, get cited and be on your way, rather than getting booked, arrested, and dragged into court. And sure, if you get caught, it may show up on your record, affecting job prospects and such. But you know, the stigma of a drug charge looms large, even if it's just weed. Decriminalization doesn't erase that.\n\nImagine the cost, though. Arresting, booking, and processing people, not to mention the trials, public defenders, judges, and court fees. It adds up to a hefty bill for the state. In places strapped for cash, they just can't afford to make that concession, even if it might free up some money for other needs. But in a place like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, it's a different story. Decriminalizing it could mean more funds for public education and social programs.\n\nNow, I’m not saying we should make it legal to walk around smoking it everywhere. That would be a whole different kettle of fish. It's still taboo in many places, and the thought of seeing people openly smoking weed on the streets might be uncomfortable for some. And then there's the issue of lifestyle impact. Sure, alcohol can mess with your driving skills, but marijuana often affects people's lifestyle more than just their decision-making abilities.\n\nEvery person reacts differently, you know? Some can handle anything, others know how to moderate, and some just can't. So, it's hard to generalize about how these substances affect people. But make no mistake, they all have their adverse effects.",

            "&nbsp; I'm still undecided about the nuptial union debate. See, it's a delicate dance, balancing the separation of church and state with the sanctity of marriage. &nbsp; I mean, if the government can't distinguish between a holy union and a civil one, then why should we let them dictate how we define love? &nbsp; So, if two people are legally bound, shouldn't we just call it a civil union? &nbsp; It's a union of two individuals, no more, no less. &nbsp; And if all states can reach a sensible consensus, then let's push for federal recognition, but a constitutional ban on gay marriage? That's as absurd as amending our founding document for a fling. &nbsp; It just doesn't warrant such a grand gesture. &nbsp; So, no. I'm not convinced.\n\n&nbsp;",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like, homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends, I think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think that it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue. However, I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own, rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic, and a lot of states are republican. Obviously, democratic states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you’re living in a democratic state, like, obviously you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think that you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. So I think I don’t think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that. But yeah, I don’t feel as though Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think that it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don’t think like, I don’t think that Bush doesn’t live in every single state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I guess I don’t know. So, I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he’s gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like, it’s just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision. Not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t",
            "Hmm, I gotta say, I don't buy that. Let me break it down for you. You see, Myspace is meant for public consumption, right? It's like a digital bulletin board for everyone to see, whether it's your peers or not. If school officials want to check up on what students are up to, they've got every right to do so, especially if it's for the greater good. Now, I'm not saying they should go snooping for no reason, but if they find something that could save lives or make the school safer, I think they should be allowed to do their job. It's a responsibility of the school system to keep students safe. I mean, if they find out about students partying or doing drugs, that's their job, right? They're there to keep us safe, not to spy on us. But if it helps make the school a better place, then I'm all for it. The same goes for the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. Sure, we do drills and practice for lockdowns. That's part of making the school safer. So, if school officials are doing the same, I think they're just trying to keep us safe. They're not invading our privacy, they're just doing their job.",

I was deeply affected by the World Trade Center attacks, and I was ready to unleash hell over there.\nBut looking back, I think we let our emotions cloud our judgment.

I don't believe our presence there has made any real difference. They’re so caught up in their own conflicts, they can’t focus on us. It's like we’re just a distraction.\nI've lost all interest in what happens over there. I mean, they’re just fighting amongst themselves, so why should we care? They can’t even get along with themselves.\nWe just went in there with our emotions high and no real plan. We were driven by anger and revenge, more than anything else. We should have been more rational about what we were getting into. We couldn’t have just allowed them to get away with what they did.\nI still think we had no choice but to go to war, but we should have been better prepared. We had no clear plan, no unity of purpose. We just went in with emotions, and that’s what we ended up creating.\nI really don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. They’re always going to be like that, and I don’t think we’re making enough progress to justify our stay.\nWe need to consider leaving, and we need to do it soon. We can’t stay over there forever.

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church could use some tweaking in a few ways, you know?\nThey've been chatting about their dwindling flock, and I think it's because they're not too accepting, you see?\nTake gay marriage, abortion, birth control—these are just a few examples.\nThey've got strong views, no doubt, but they're a bit antiquated, if you get my drift.\nI think if they embraced a more contemporary outlook, they wouldn't be so worried about losing their followers.\nI've heard of folks distancing themselves from the Church due to their stance on these issues.\nPeople aren't aligning with their views on certain matters these days.\nSo I guess they think the Church is a bit off on these topics.\nI mean, the Church's anti-abortion stance might make some uncomfortable, especially if they believe in it.\nAnd the same goes for gay marriage—if you feel strongly about it, you might not want to follow a church that's against it.\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or let priests get married, but then again, I'm not sure if that would've changed what happened.\nI mean, it's hard to say what they'd do differently if they could marry or have women priests.\nBut I'm not convinced it would've made a significant difference.\nI just don't get why priests can't have a family life like everyone else.\nThey say they're married to God, but everyone else has both work and family life, so why can't they?",
            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage, you know. I mean, who am I to judge? Whether someone is born that way, or whatever, I don't think it's something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can marry, but not two people of the same sex. That's wrong, in my opinion. I haven't really given the topic much thought, but I'd say that's just not right. It's not a choice, like they don't have a say in how they are. I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It doesn't seem like a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, or even a moral one. It's not about our country's security or anything like that. It's just that they're out of place when they try to interject in people's lives. And that's just who they are. It's like their birthright, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's all I have to say about that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Why? Well, let me put it simply, there's no compelling reason not to. Some people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but it's just not that straightforward. Truth be told, there are so many different aspects to this issue that it's foolish to compare it to anything else. It's like two sides of the same coin, no matter how much you try to flip it, they're still the same face. It's not like one is heads and the other tails, they're just different sides of the same reality. And there are so many civil rights implications at play here, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or be by your side in your time of need, because they're not technically family. I mean, if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone, it seems silly to deny them that right. Plus, scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same success rates as heterosexual couples in terms of relationship satisfaction. It's just a relationship, plain and simple. And let's not forget, the people who want to get married aren't asking for the religious sanctification of their union. They just want a legal document that recognizes their commitment, a marriage certificate. If there's no religious involvement, then how can that be an issue? I can't comprehend why people like Catholics would object to this based on their religious beliefs, especially when they're not even directly involved. If you're allowing civil unions, then why not allow marriage? It's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. Homosexual relationships are no different in terms of community involvement or parenting skills. Children of gay couples are just as well-adjusted as children of heterosexual couples. And the federal government should be at the forefront of this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. But, of course, President Bush has his own strong views on this matter, much like his stance on abortion and stem cell research. He seems to be driven by moral reasons, but morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not enforce the morality of one group while ignoring the rest. It's hypocritical to let laws be made that enforce religious standards on everyone, especially considering the recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not accurate. The American Psychological Association has stated this is untrue. If only people listened to institutions that do actual research instead of relying on popular opinion or their local community's beliefs.",
            "Now, let me start by saying that I happen to be working at a hospital pharmacy this summer. And while it's true that not all illegal drugs are beneficial, there's a certain irony in that. You see, the very fact that something is illegal doesn't mean it lacks use, especially in the medical field. I'm talking about opioids like oxycodone, vicodin, percocets—you name it. They're controlled substances because they have their benefits, yet we use them all the time. And the thing about marijuana, well, it's not the same as alcohol. While both can be abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, is a different beast. I believe you could gradually make it legal, but first, you've got to remove that taboo around marijuana. Too many people have a skewed image of it, thinking it's as harmful as heroin or cocaine. But I'm telling you, it's not. If we can get past that image, people might start using it responsibly, and certainly for medicinal purposes. But right now, with that stigma? It's a no-go.",
            "So, I'm of the opinion that the church has subtly adapted to the 21st century, but it ain't as rigid as it used to be. Growing up, it was all about Sunday mass, with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses. I'd see most of my private school friends there on weekends. But now, it's different. They've introduced a 'teenage mass,' cutting it down to 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, even in their beachwear. Families are coming in late, and at morning masses, you see folks in jeans and khakis. It's more relaxed, but I'm not aware of the church's politics, so that's all I've got. As for the accusations against Catholic priests, I think it's a matter of individual choice and genetics. Marriage, for them or any other faith, wouldn't change that. The problem's in the genes, not in the church's rules or lack thereof. The church could've done more to address this, but I don't think it's entirely their fault.",
            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the whole thing, but it seems everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we seem to have entered Iraq as a pretext. There were several pretexts that led us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really grinds my gears. It just seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, coming back from his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nTo me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well, since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm\nI forget the name of\nUm\nthe secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance sort of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too. Which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell\nI do think it’s gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting less than a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government. And I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm\n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",

            "Oh\nI really don’t feel like\nIt’s right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in our constitution, it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s crystal clear\nIt’s crystal clear\nOh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in our constitution\nSo\nOh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one church’s belief over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics\nOh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it, except for up in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nOh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nOh\nLike been a key aspect of our constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradiction to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nOh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think that the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to tie the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really didn’t have much to do with each other\nBut the government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage against the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003\nI myself am against war, especially making a preemptive strike. I was against that\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War\nThe government should have learned from past mistakes\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died\nAnd I don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government\nUm\nAnd the United States is trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what happened in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy\nAnd it was a similar thing with Iraq\nI think the government should have known it would be a long and hard ordeal, not a clear victory like what was hoped for\nUm\nI think the government wasn’t prepared for the insurgents that would rise up\nFighting specific citizens and not a real army\nI think the government should have planned better\nI mean, we’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still dying\nAnd trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces\nIt’s a long process and I think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay\nI mean, democracy takes years to implement and become successful\nAnd I think the government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nUm\nSo\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, it’s a difficult decision to make\nI mean, once you go in there and we’ve been there for so long, how can we abandon these people\nWe’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life\nSo it’s probably something we should see to its finish, but then there’s also the consideration of the American casualties\nHow much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq\nUm\nGoing back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we’re invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why isn’t it just Iraq\nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries\nI think the big reason for that is the oil issue,\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nUm\nAnother pretext was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found\nYet, places like North Korea, which we know has weapons of mass destruction, we’re not attacking\nI don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not",
            "Alright, let me see, I'm really for gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. So, denying people rights based on something they have no control over seems kind of inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this. It's not even something that should be on a state level; it's a personal, household level. My neighborhood, for instance, has two or three openly gay couples living there, not married because they're not allowed to. But they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else. And with Bush trying to play God and interpret marriage the way he wants, it's just ridiculous.\n\nI mean, I think it's something that's been proven to be a biological predisposition. I've read and heard from numerous publications that it's something you might be predisposed to being a homosexual, not something that's solely sociological. Like growing up with lots of sisters and a single father could influence it, but it's not the only factor.\n\nBut other than the obvious, I think maybe it's because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can just run off to Las Vegas and do it without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal, private thing, not something in the public domain or national and federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "Listen, putting stuff online is public. People can see it, and it can color their opinions of you. If you're talking about harmful stuff, like wanting to blow something up or shoot someone, someone's gonna notice. The internet is a huge public forum, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. The school isn't the one who got the warning, someone else did. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have prevented it. But sometimes, people just mess around, and you don't know what to take seriously. Like that time at school; something happened, and someone overheard someone else saying something, then called it in. When they found out who said it, they checked their Facebook, and it turned out they were just joking. But in that situation, it became serious. When you put something out there, it's not private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. I don't think school officials should friend their students on social media and snoop around. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no privacy issue because it's something they were given access to. If there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend students. That's not appropriate. I wouldn't want to see my residents' wild nights out on Facebook, not because I care, but because it's not my business. It's not my place to know or to act on it. I respect their privacy, and I don't need that connection.",
            "Um, I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now, it's just about proving our global dominance, and maybe even settling old scores. George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein might have played a role. If the original intent was to give a fair political system to a country under a tyrant, it was a just cause. But over time, I think our objectives have become murky, like we're still at war just to prove we can be at war. We're not ready to admit defeat, and we're spending billions of dollars on a war that's gone on too long. We've been neglecting our own economy, our own citizens' well-being, and it's not sustainable. I mean, they're spending billions and billions, and there are more pressing issues at home, like poverty and infrastructure, that we should be funding instead. Right now, that money is being spent on a war that's lost its cause. I think it's time to step back and let the locals handle it.",
            "Can I clarify something? You know, I've heard that someone went online and found something that... well, it's hard to put into words.\n\nOkay, so just to make sure I understand, you're saying that what happened wasn't an invasion of privacy?\n\nRight. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available to anyone. You have to have a friend's permission to see someone's profile, but that's their choice. If they've accepted you as a friend, you're giving them permission to see what you're sharing.\n\nI mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you're essentially opening yourself up to a wider audience. And if I'm being honest, I think that's a bit unnerving.\n\nIt's tough, you know? You can't realistically have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something like this. But then again, if it's a case of the school or authorities looking at certain profiles, that could be a bit unfair. It could feel like they're singling out specific students.\n\nI don't know, though. It depends on the situation. Maybe they were looking for evidence of something, or maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to stumble upon something.\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are people out there who can find out a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in just a few minutes. That's a bit scary.\n\nI don't think I'd meet up with someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize but they know who I am from my IM. It's hard because I have to think about my interests, my schedule, even who I'm friends with. It's a tricky balance, you know? I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking.\n\nMy roommate told me that in high school, some schools actually banned students from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the power to do that.\n\nI don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I don't think they had the right to tell people they couldn't have Myspace.",
            "Alright\nUm\nThere are just two more times I need to mention the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI feel a bit hypocritical discussing it\nI mean, I hate to jump on the bandwagon with those who say, \"I was against it from the start\"\nUm\nI was, but it's no longer relevant\nBecause the general consensus worldwide was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration which refuses to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nYou just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThe ones for the United States, Iraq, and globally\nAnd I mean no, like\nAbout seventy five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the U.S. troops over there think it was a dumb idea, that we should leave within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s been a complete disaster since we arrived\nAnd pulling out will be just as disastrous\nUm\nIt’s just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s too big a gap for any administration to understand\nAnd they think they can bring democracy to an area where it doesn’t belong\nUm\nI mean sure, Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone contests that\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will just turn into a mess\nLike getting stuck in quicksand when we went in\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay\nUm\nI’m sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why we should stay\nUm\nBut, I haven’t heard a legitimate reason to stay any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean if they want to do it gradually over a course of a year or a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t leave now\nUm\nI mean I read this statistic that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and a quarter think we should leave now\nThese are the people we’re trying to help\nUm\nThey know better than us\nAnd if we ask and they say yes, then it’s not our fault if things go wrong\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out later, we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nBut no, we’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nUm\nBut it’ll be better than where we are right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Um\nYeah, I do feel gender discrimination is still notably prevalent in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just with women, although they seem to bear the brunt of it\nUm\nI mean, overall, I believe women have it tougher due to the glass ceiling, where even though we're supposed to be equal, there's a lot of resistance to having a woman in a leadership role, especially if they're in a traditionally male-dominated field\nI guess the same goes for men too, like in fashion\nUm\nAnd being a stay-at-home dad\nIt's still quite unusual\nUm\nSociety often looks down on that because they assume the male should be the breadwinner\nAnd if a woman has a better job, they might find it hard to understand why the male isn't working\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight\nI don't know if that makes sense, but it’s because guys in fashion often have a different lifestyle\nUm\nSo if you're a typical man in fashion, people might think you don't really understand fashion because you're a man\nAnd they might think you don't understand a woman's perspective, like other women do\nUm\nSo, depending on the field of work, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is quite challenging because society is so set in its ways\nWe've certainly come far since the 1800s, but change happens slowly\nUm\nIf we keep working at this pace, where women are climbing higher in the business world and becoming CEOs, people are starting to accept it more\nAnd the same goes for stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the female is the better earner or that she wants to work\nUm\nAnd in fashion too, people start to realize that maybe guys are listening to their female friends or wives\nSo they start to understand where men are coming from\nSo, I guess you kinda have to promote the positive qualities of the stereotypically discriminated against without being too pushy\nUm\nBut just by highlighting their qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nUm\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to happen naturally\nUm\nSo, I don't think there's much more we can do right now because we've come so far, and change takes time\nUm\nWell, I guess people also discriminate against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't great, but you're really intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job\nOther men might look down on you because they think you're not as credible if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nUm\nSo, yeah, sometimes where you're from can discriminate against you\nUm\nAnd it's not just gender, but also within genders\nUm\nI don't know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nSo not really",
            "You see, they didn’t legalize it, no, not by a long shot. They decriminalized it, yeah. That means they knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—you know, get cited and be on your way, rather than getting booked, arrested, and dragged into court. And sure, if you get caught, it may show up on your record, affecting job prospects and such. But you know, the stigma of a drug charge looms large, even if it's just weed. Decriminalization doesn't erase that.\n\nImagine the cost, though. Arresting, booking, and processing people, not to mention the trials, public defenders, judges, and court fees. It adds up to a hefty bill for the state. In places strapped for cash, they just can't afford to make that concession, even if it might free up some money for other needs. But in a place like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, it's a different story. Decriminalizing it could mean more funds for public education and social programs.\n\nNow, I’m not saying we should make it legal to walk around smoking it everywhere. That would be a whole different kettle of fish. It's still taboo in many places, and the thought of seeing people openly smoking weed on the streets might be uncomfortable for some. And then there's the issue of lifestyle impact. Sure, alcohol can mess with your driving skills, but marijuana often affects people's lifestyle more than just their decision-making abilities.\n\nEvery person reacts differently, you know? Some can handle anything, others know how to moderate, and some just can't. So, it's hard to generalize about how these substances affect people. But make no mistake, they all have their adverse effects.",
            "I'd say yes,\nBecause some of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition,\nLike they've done the same rituals for ages.\nIt’s good to be grounded in tradition,\nBut it's also essential to adapt to change.\nI mean, a lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church weekly,\nAnd they're quite stringent about their rituals.\nSometimes, I feel the Catholic Church doesn't welcome those who aren't perfect followers,\nOr those of different faiths.\nLike, my dad was an Episcopalian,\nWhich I know is still a Christian denomination,\nBut the Catholic Church wouldn't marry my parents,\nBecause of his religion.\nThat's not exactly embracing other religions, is it?\nWe're taught to love others, but it's hypocritical to love and not accept.\nSo, the doctrine says one thing, but the practice often goes against it,\nJust because it's outdated.\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would deter pedophilic behavior,\nBecause it's about power and control, not marriage.\nAnd who knows, it might even add a layer of complexity.\nWell, child molesters are likely to act that way regardless of their marital status,\nIt's about the power dynamic, not the spouse.\nSo, I don't think marrying priests would stop those acts.\nIt might not change much.",
            "&nbsp; I'm still undecided about the nuptial union debate. See, it's a delicate dance, balancing the separation of church and state with the sanctity of marriage. &nbsp; I mean, if the government can't distinguish between a holy union and a civil one, then why should we let them dictate how we define love? &nbsp; So, if two people are legally bound, shouldn't we just call it a civil union? &nbsp; It's a union of two individuals, no more, no less. &nbsp; And if all states can reach a sensible consensus, then let's push for federal recognition, but a constitutional ban on gay marriage? That's as absurd as amending our founding document for a fling. &nbsp; It just doesn't warrant such a grand gesture. &nbsp; So, no. I'm not convinced.\n\n&nbsp;",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like, homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends, I think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think that it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue. However, I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own, rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic, and a lot of states are republican. Obviously, democratic states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you’re living in a democratic state, like, obviously you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think that you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. So I think I don’t think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that. But yeah, I don’t feel as though Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think that it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don’t think like, I don’t think that Bush doesn’t live in every single state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I guess I don’t know. So, I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he’s gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like, it’s just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision. Not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t",
            "Hmm, I gotta say, I don't buy that. Let me break it down for you. You see, Myspace is meant for public consumption, right? It's like a digital bulletin board for everyone to see, whether it's your peers or not. If school officials want to check up on what students are up to, they've got every right to do so, especially if it's for the greater good. Now, I'm not saying they should go snooping for no reason, but if they find something that could save lives or make the school safer, I think they should be allowed to do their job. It's a responsibility of the school system to keep students safe. I mean, if they find out about students partying or doing drugs, that's their job, right? They're there to keep us safe, not to spy on us. But if it helps make the school a better place, then I'm all for it. The same goes for the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. Sure, we do drills and practice for lockdowns. That's part of making the school safer. So, if school officials are doing the same, I think they're just trying to keep us safe. They're not invading our privacy, they're just doing their job.",
            "Right\nYeah\nThe war\nYeah\nAt first, I was all in. I was deeply affected by the World Trade Center attacks, and I was ready to unleash hell over there.\nBut looking back, I think we let our emotions cloud our judgment. We didn't think about the long-term consequences and just went in unprepared. We were like a bull in a china shop, causing more chaos than it was worth.\nI’ve since changed my stance. I don't believe our presence there has made any real difference. They’re so caught up in their own conflicts, they can’t focus on us. It's like we’re just a distraction.\nI've lost all interest in what happens over there. I mean, they’re just fighting amongst themselves, so why should we care? They can’t even get along with themselves.\nWe just went in there with our emotions high and no real plan. We were driven by anger and revenge, more than anything else. We should have been more rational about what we were getting into. We couldn’t have just allowed them to get away with what they did.\nI still think we had no choice but to go to war, but we should have been better prepared. We had no clear plan, no unity of purpose. We just went in with emotions, and that’s what we ended up creating.\nI really don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. They’re always going to be like that, and I don’t think we’re making enough progress to justify our stay.\nWe need to consider leaving, and we need to do it soon. We can’t stay over there forever. It’s hurting us more than it’s helping.\nSo, that’s where I stand."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Well, I'm not against gay marriage, you know. I mean, who am I to judge? Whether someone is born that way, or whatever, I don't think it's something people choose. So, I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can marry, but not two people of the same sex. That's wrong, in my opinion. I haven't really given the topic much thought, but I'd say that's just not right. It's not a choice, like they don't have a say in how they are. I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It doesn't seem like a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, or even a moral one. It's not about our country's security or anything like that. It's just that they're out of place when they try to interject in people's lives. And that's just who they are. It's like their birthright, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's all I have to say about that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Why? Well, let me put it simply, there's no compelling reason not to. Some people fear that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but it's just not that straightforward. Truth be told, there are so many different aspects to this issue that it's foolish to compare it to anything else. It's like two sides of the same coin, no matter how much you try to flip it, they're still the same face. It's not like one is heads and the other tails, they're just different sides of the same reality. And there are so many civil rights implications at play here, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or be by your side in your time of need, because they're not technically family. I mean, if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone, it seems silly to deny them that right. Plus, scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same success rates as heterosexual couples in terms of relationship satisfaction. It's just a relationship, plain and simple. And let's not forget, the people who want to get married aren't asking for the religious sanctification of their union. They just want a legal document that recognizes their commitment, a marriage certificate. If there's no religious involvement, then how can that be an issue? I can't comprehend why people like Catholics would object to this based on their religious beliefs, especially when they're not even directly involved. If you're allowing civil unions, then why not allow marriage? It's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. Homosexual relationships are no different in terms of community involvement or parenting skills. Children of gay couples are just as well-adjusted as children of heterosexual couples. And the federal government should be at the forefront of this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. But, of course, President Bush has his own strong views on this matter, much like his stance on abortion and stem cell research. He seems to be driven by moral reasons, but morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not enforce the morality of one group while ignoring the rest. It's hypocritical to let laws be made that enforce religious standards on everyone, especially considering the recent controversies about the pledge of allegiance. Many people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not accurate. The American Psychological Association has stated this is untrue. If only people listened to institutions that do actual research instead of relying on popular opinion or their local community's beliefs.",
            "Now, let me start by saying that I happen to be working at a hospital pharmacy this summer. And while it's true that not all illegal drugs are beneficial, there's a certain irony in that. You see, the very fact that something is illegal doesn't mean it lacks use, especially in the medical field. I'm talking about opioids like oxycodone, vicodin, percocets—you name it. They're controlled substances because they have their benefits, yet we use them all the time. And the thing about marijuana, well, it's not the same as alcohol. While both can be abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, is a different beast. I believe you could gradually make it legal, but first, you've got to remove that taboo around marijuana. Too many people have a skewed image of it, thinking it's as harmful as heroin or cocaine. But I'm telling you, it's not. If we can get past that image, people might start using it responsibly, and certainly for medicinal purposes. But right now, with that stigma? It's a no-go.",
            "So, I'm of the opinion that the church has subtly adapted to the 21st century, but it ain't as rigid as it used to be. Growing up, it was all about Sunday mass, with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses. I'd see most of my private school friends there on weekends. But now, it's different. They've introduced a 'teenage mass,' cutting it down to 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, even in their beachwear. Families are coming in late, and at morning masses, you see folks in jeans and khakis. It's more relaxed, but I'm not aware of the church's politics, so that's all I've got. As for the accusations against Catholic priests, I think it's a matter of individual choice and genetics. Marriage, for them or any other faith, wouldn't change that. The problem's in the genes, not in the church's rules or lack thereof. The church could've done more to address this, but I don't think it's entirely their fault.",
            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the whole thing, but it seems everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we seem to have entered Iraq as a pretext. There were several pretexts that led us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really grinds my gears. It just seems like the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, coming back from his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nTo me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well, since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm\nI forget the name of\nUm\nthe secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance sort of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too. Which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell\nI do think it’s gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting less than a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.

            "Oh\nI really don’t feel like\nIt’s right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in our constitution, it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s crystal clear\nIt’s crystal clear\nOh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in our constitution\nSo\nOh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one church’s belief over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics\nOh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it, except for up in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nOh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nOh\nLike been a key aspect of our constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradiction to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nOh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think that the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to tie the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really didn’t have much to do with each other\nBut the government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage against the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003\nI myself am against war, especially making a preemptive strike. I was against that\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War\nThe government should have learned from past mistakes\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died\nAnd I don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would follow removing the Iraqi government\nUm\nAnd the United States is trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what happened in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy\nAnd it was a similar thing with Iraq\nI think the government should have known it would be a long and hard ordeal, not a clear victory like what was hoped for\nUm\nI think the government wasn’t prepared for the insurgents that would rise up\nFighting specific citizens and not a real army\nI think the government should have planned better\nI mean, we’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still dying\nAnd trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces\nIt’s a long process and I think the government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay\nI mean, democracy takes years to implement and become successful\nAnd I think the government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nUm\nSo\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, it’s a difficult decision to make\nI mean, once you go in there and we’ve been there for so long, how can we abandon these people\nWe’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life\nSo it’s probably something we should see to its finish, but then there’s also the consideration of the American casualties\nHow much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq\nUm\nGoing back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we’re invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why isn’t it just Iraq\nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries\nI think the big reason for that is the oil issue,\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nUm\nAnother pretext was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found\nYet, places like North Korea, which we know has weapons of mass destruction, we’re not attacking\nI don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not",
            "Alright, let me see, I'm really for gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. So, denying people rights based on something they have no control over seems kind of inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this. It's not even something that should be on a state level; it's a personal, household level. My neighborhood, for instance, has two or three openly gay couples living there, not married because they're not allowed to. But they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else. And with Bush trying to play God and interpret marriage the way he wants, it's just ridiculous.\n\nI mean, I think it's something that's been proven to be a biological predisposition. I've read and heard from numerous publications that it's something you might be predisposed to being a homosexual, not something that's solely sociological. Like growing up with lots of sisters and a single father could influence it, but it's not the only factor.\n\nBut other than the obvious, I think maybe it's because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can just run off to Las Vegas and do it without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal, private thing, not something in the public domain or national and federal domain.\n\nNo, no.",
            "Listen, putting stuff online is public. People can see it, and it can color their opinions of you. If you're talking about harmful stuff, like wanting to blow something up or shoot someone, someone's gonna notice. The internet is a huge public forum, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. The school isn't the one who got the warning, someone else did. They have to act on it because if something happens, they could have prevented it. But sometimes, people just mess around, and you don't know what to take seriously. Like that time at school; something happened, and someone overheard someone else saying something, then called it in. When they found out who said it, they checked their Facebook, and it turned out they were just joking. But in that situation, it became serious. When you put something out there, it's not private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. I don't think school officials should friend their students on social media and snoop around. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no privacy issue because it's something they were given access to. If there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I don't think teachers should make fake accounts to friend students. That's not appropriate. I wouldn't want to see my residents' wild nights out on Facebook, not because I care, but because it's not my business. It's not my place to know or to act on it. I respect their privacy, and I don't need that connection.",
            "Um, I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've lost sight of that original goal. Now, it's just about proving our global dominance, and maybe even settling old scores. George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein might have played a role. If the original intent was to give a fair political system to a country under a tyrant, it was a just cause. But over time, I think our objectives have become murky, like we're still at war just to prove we can be at war. We're not ready to admit defeat, and we're spending billions of dollars on a war that's gone on too long. We've been neglecting our own economy, our own citizens' well-being, and it's not sustainable. I mean, they're spending billions and billions, and there are more pressing issues at home, like poverty and infrastructure, that we should be funding instead. Right now, that money is being spent on a war that's lost its cause. I think it's time to step back and let the locals handle it.",
            "Can I clarify something? You know, I've heard that someone went online and found something that... well, it's hard to put into words.\n\nOkay, so just to make sure I understand, you're saying that what happened wasn't an invasion of privacy?\n\nRight. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much available to anyone. You have to have a friend's permission to see someone's profile, but that's their choice. If they've accepted you as a friend, you're giving them permission to see what you're sharing.\n\nI mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you're essentially opening yourself up to a wider audience. And if I'm being honest, I think that's a bit unnerving.\n\nIt's tough, you know? You can't realistically have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent something like this. But then again, if it's a case of the school or authorities looking at certain profiles, that could be a bit unfair. It could feel like they're singling out specific students.\n\nI don't know, though. It depends on the situation. Maybe they were looking for evidence of something, or maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to stumble upon something.\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that there are people out there who can find out a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen something on TV where a guy was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on instant messenger in just a few minutes. That's a bit scary.\n\nI don't think I'd meet up with someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize but they know who I am from my IM. It's hard because I have to think about my interests, my schedule, even who I'm friends with. It's a tricky balance, you know? I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking.\n\nMy roommate told me that in high school, some schools actually banned students from having Myspace. That seemed a bit strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the power to do that.\n\nI don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I don't think they had the right to tell people they couldn't have Myspace.",

            "Um\nYeah, I do feel gender discrimination is still notably prevalent in the United States\nUm\nAnd it's not just with women, although they seem to bear the brunt of it\nUm\nI mean, overall, I believe women have it tougher due to the glass ceiling, where even though we're supposed to be equal, there's a lot of resistance to having a woman in a leadership role, especially if they're in a traditionally male-dominated field\nI guess the same goes for men too, like in fashion\nUm\nAnd being a stay-at-home dad\nIt's still quite unusual\nUm\nSociety often looks down on that because they assume the male should be the breadwinner\nAnd if a woman has a better job, they might find it hard to understand why the male isn't working\nUm\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight\nI don't know if that makes sense, but it’s because guys in fashion often have a different lifestyle\nUm\nSo if you're a typical man in fashion, people might think you don't really understand fashion because you're a man\nAnd they might think you don't understand a woman's perspective, like other women do\nUm\nSo, depending on the field of work, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is quite challenging because society is so set in its ways\nWe've certainly come far since the 1800s, but change happens slowly\nUm\nIf we keep working at this pace, where women are climbing higher in the business world and becoming CEOs, people are starting to accept it more\nAnd the same goes for stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because people realize maybe the female is the better earner or that she wants to work\nUm\nAnd in fashion too, people start to realize that maybe guys are listening to their female friends or wives\nSo they start to understand where men are coming from\nSo, I guess you kinda have to promote the positive qualities of the stereotypically discriminated against without being too pushy\nUm\nBut just by highlighting their qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nUm\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to happen naturally\nUm\nSo, I don't think there's much more we can do right now because we've come so far, and change takes time\nUm\nWell, I guess people also discriminate against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't great, but you're really intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job\nOther men might look down on you because they think you're not as credible if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nUm\nSo, yeah, sometimes where you're from can discriminate against you\nUm\nAnd it's not just gender, but also within genders\nUm\nI don't know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nSo not really",
            "You see, they didn’t legalize it, no, not by a long shot. They decriminalized it, yeah. That means they knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—you know, get cited and be on your way, rather than getting booked, arrested, and dragged into court. And sure, if you get caught, it may show up on your record, affecting job prospects and such. But you know, the stigma of a drug charge looms large, even if it's just weed. Decriminalization doesn't erase that.\n\nImagine the cost, though. Arresting, booking, and processing people, not to mention the trials, public defenders, judges, and court fees. It adds up to a hefty bill for the state. In places strapped for cash, they just can't afford to make that concession, even if it might free up some money for other needs. But in a place like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, it's a different story. Decriminalizing it could mean more funds for public education and social programs.\n\nNow, I’m not saying we should make it legal to walk around smoking it everywhere. That would be a whole different kettle of fish. It's still taboo in many places, and the thought of seeing people openly smoking weed on the streets might be uncomfortable for some. And then there's the issue of lifestyle impact. Sure, alcohol can mess with your driving skills, but marijuana often affects people's lifestyle more than just their decision-making abilities.\n\nEvery person reacts differently, you know? Some can handle anything, others know how to moderate, and some just can't. So, it's hard to generalize about how these substances affect people. But make no mistake, they all have their adverse effects.",
            "I'd say yes,\nBecause some of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition,\nLike they've done the same rituals for ages.\nIt’s good to be grounded in tradition,\nBut it's also essential to adapt to change.\nI mean, a lot of Catholics believe they must attend Church weekly,\nAnd they're quite stringent about their rituals.\nSometimes, I feel the Catholic Church doesn't welcome those who aren't perfect followers,\nOr those of different faiths.\nLike, my dad was an Episcopalian,\nWhich I know is still a Christian denomination,\nBut the Catholic Church wouldn't marry my parents,\nBecause of his religion.\nThat's not exactly embracing other religions, is it?\nWe're taught to love others, but it's hypocritical to love and not accept.\nSo, the doctrine says one thing, but the practice often goes against it,\nJust because it's outdated.\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would deter pedophilic behavior,\nBecause it's about power and control, not marriage.\nAnd who knows, it might even add a layer of complexity.\nWell, child molesters are likely to act that way regardless of their marital status,\nIt's about the power dynamic, not the spouse.\nSo, I don't think marrying priests would stop those acts.\nIt might not change much.",
            "&nbsp; I'm still undecided about the nuptial union debate. See, it's a delicate dance, balancing the separation of church and state with the sanctity of marriage. &nbsp; I mean, if the government can't distinguish between a holy union and a civil one, then why should we let them dictate how we define love? &nbsp; So, if two people are legally bound, shouldn't we just call it a civil union? &nbsp; It's a union of two individuals, no more, no less. &nbsp; And if all states can reach a sensible consensus, then let's push for federal recognition, but a constitutional ban on gay marriage? That's as absurd as amending our founding document for a fling. &nbsp; It just doesn't warrant such a grand gesture. &nbsp; So, no. I'm not convinced.\n\n&nbsp;",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like, homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends, I think that I don’t necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think that it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue. However, I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own, rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic, and a lot of states are republican. Obviously, democratic states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you’re living in a democratic state, like, obviously you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think that you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. So I think I don’t think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals so I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I kind of already answered that. But yeah, I don’t feel as though Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think that it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don’t think like, I don’t think that Bush doesn’t live in every single state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I guess I don’t know. So, I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he’s gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, like, it’s just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision. Not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t",
            "Hmm, I gotta say, I don't buy that. Let me break it down for you. You see, Myspace is meant for public consumption, right? It's like a digital bulletin board for everyone to see, whether it's your peers or not. If school officials want to check up on what students are up to, they've got every right to do so, especially if it's for the greater good. Now, I'm not saying they should go snooping for no reason, but if they find something that could save lives or make the school safer, I think they should be allowed to do their job. It's a responsibility of the school system to keep students safe. I mean, if they find out about students partying or doing drugs, that's their job, right? They're there to keep us safe, not to spy on us. But if it helps make the school a better place, then I'm all for it. The same goes for the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. Sure, we do drills and practice for lockdowns. That's part of making the school safer. So, if school officials are doing the same, I think they're just trying to keep us safe. They're not invading our privacy, they're just doing their job.",

I was deeply affected by the World Trade Center attacks, and I was ready to unleash hell over there.\nBut looking back, I think we let our emotions cloud our judgment.

I don't believe our presence there has made any real difference. They’re so caught up in their own conflicts, they can’t focus on us. It's like we’re just a distraction.\nI've lost all interest in what happens over there. I mean, they’re just fighting amongst themselves, so why should we care? They can’t even get along with themselves.\nWe just went in there with our emotions high and no real plan. We were driven by anger and revenge, more than anything else. We should have been more rational about what we were getting into. We couldn’t have just allowed them to get away with what they did.\nI still think we had no choice but to go to war, but we should have been better prepared. We had no clear plan, no unity of purpose. We just went in with emotions, and that’s what we ended up creating.\nI really don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. They’re always going to be like that, and I don’t think we’re making enough progress to justify our stay.\nWe need to consider leaving, and we need to do it soon. We can’t stay over there forever.
