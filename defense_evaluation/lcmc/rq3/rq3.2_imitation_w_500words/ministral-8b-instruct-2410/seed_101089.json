            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Alright, so there are a few points where I think the Catholic Church needs to shift. I've heard they're losing some of their flock because they're not so accepting of various views. Take, for instance, issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stance on these is quite steadfast, which is fine, but it seems a bit outdated. If they could adopt a more contemporary viewpoint, they might not have to worry about dwindling attendance. I've noticed some people are starting to veer away from the Church due to their perspectives on these issues. It's like, if you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a denomination where that's considered wrong. The same goes for LGBTQ+ rights—if you strongly believe in them, you might not want to be part of a faith that doesn't agree. I don't see why female priests or married priests should be an issue, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented past scandals. Maybe they would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests, but it's hard to tell. I mean, it's not like priests are married to their work and nothing else—everyone's got a family life and other commitments. So why can't priests have that too?",
            "I'm not inherently opposed to same-sex marriage. Whether people are born gay or come to it later, I don't believe it's a choice or something they can consciously decide. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can't marry, but two people of the same sex can't either. It seems like they don't have a choice in who they are attracted to, just as I didn't choose to be straight. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who they are, and I don't think they should be punished or put on a stage for it. I don't think the government has any right to interject in people's personal lives. It's just how they're born, and it doesn't affect the security of our country. It's just them being themselves, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Honestly, there isn't a compelling reason not to. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's so much more complex than that. There are so many facets to it that it can't be equated to heterosexual relationships. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; heads and tails are not one and the same. Yet, in many respects, they are the same. Civil rights such as property taxes and healthcare are affected. A partner in a gay relationship can't be in the room with you if you're sick, can't visit you, because they're not technically considered family. That's absurd if you're spending the rest of your life together. Numerous scientific studies show that homosexual couples enjoy the same level of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, the same thing. The issue often lies in the fact that homosexuals aren't asking to marry in a church, but for a legal document from the government. If it's not about church or state, it shouldn't be an issue. I struggle to understand why people like Catholics can get hung up on it being against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriages? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They're the same in many ways - relationship roles played by different partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, children's adjustments, and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. But it's a new concept, hard to quantify. The main concern is how children are treated by peers and society. In New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and protests. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. They can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state. An amendment reversing the status quo is in order. President Bush has strong views on this, aligning with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. His reasons are mostly moral, but morality varies. It's unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It's hypocritical for the government to ban gay marriage while facing recent controversies like the \"under god\" pledge. Many are anti-gay because they believe homosexuals are psychologically damaged due to trauma or personality defects. The American Psychological Association debunks this, advising people to listen to actual research and institutions, not just neighbors and friends' opinions.",
            "So, well, I've been slinging pills at a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I gotta tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's all bad news. Take, for instance, oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are all controlled substances, but they've got their uses. I'd say keep them around for medicinal purposes. But just because something's illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. You get my drift? There are plenty of drugs that are illegal but have their place in medicine. Why should marijuana be any different? I think the taboo around it is holding us back, you know? It's not like heroine or cocaine—it's not all bad. We just need to remove that stigma and let people use it responsibly, maybe even medicinally. But maybe not all at once, we gotta ease into it. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, but both can be misused if you let them. Just gotta change the image of marijuana first, and then people might see it for what it can be.",

            "Haha\nInitially, I was alright with the concept, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we kind of stumbled into Iraq with some flimsy excuses.\nThe Bush administration tried to link Iraq to bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, all of which turned out to be false. That really set my teeth on edge, and the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just sheer malfeasance of office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th are astounding. It seems like they came into office with a war in mind.\nI can't recall the name of the treasury secretary who made this claim in his book after being forced out, but it appears that Bush Jr. was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein and maybe to increase our energy supply, all underhanded and dishonest. It's gone on long enough, but a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths. The UN and US are now considering a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that might not be ideal either, as it could cause long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The Interim government is crumbling, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister's grip on the political process is weak, and radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party holds significant influence. It's a mess, and I can't articulate my thoughts in polite company.",
            "Alright then, let's dive into this. You want to talk about the Iraq War, huh? Not sure I'm the best person for this. I mean, it's not like I have a degree in political science or anything. But, alright, let me give it a shot.\n\nMmm, okay, so what I feel about the whole Iraq War thing is that it's just kind of pointless. I mean, it's not like it was a proper war, you know? It was more like a bit of revenge for 9/11. They figured it was Iraq that did the attacks, so we went and got back at them. But, I mean, I'm not really into the whole war thing, so I don't keep up with all the details.\n\nBut what I do know is that we're over there trying to build some sort of democracy, right? And maybe we're after their oil too? But, you know, it's not really worth it. It's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and build this democracy, which is gonna take forever. And if we leave, they'll be pissed at us for messing everything up and they'll have to start over. It's a real mess.\n\nYou know, this is hard. I don't really know much about it. I just feel bad for George Bush because it's making him look like one of the worst presidents ever. It's like the Vietnam War all over again. It's like, why are we still there? We didn't even declare it a war, you know? We just went and did it.\n\nI mean, I don't think it's a real war anymore. I feel like we're just over there to show off our big guns and stuff. But I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it's not really a war, you know? It's just a big mess.\n\nBut then again, I feel bad for the families of the soldiers over there. It's not fair to them. They've got lives too, you know? And now their kids don't have a safe place to go to school. And all those different groups are just killing each other because of their beliefs.\n\nBut, if we stay, we're just gonna make things worse. We'll be trying to mold them into some sort of second United States, and it'll just make Al-Qaeda even worse. I don't think it's gonna end anytime soon. It's just gonna go on and on.\n\nThat's about it, I guess. It's a real confusing situation.",
            "Well, honestly, I think it's a bit much to try and make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I mean, it's all about respecting the constitution's clear separation of church and state. It's right there, as clear as day, and I believe that attempting to impose any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of our constitutional principles. So, I'm not convinced that it's up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to declare illegal or legal. I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, and I believe that this is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government. Separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our constitution, and any amendment trying to restrict it would be wrong and contradictory to our founding principles. I don't see why the federal government should be involved anyway. It seems like this is just a push from a Catholic perspective, and I don't see how it will impact the economy or society. If anything, it might have a positive impact. I've said my piece, I think.",

            "Alright, let's see\nI stand for um, I've always been for gay marriage\nIt's a personal preference, really\nIt's something that's been proven more and more to be biological, not sociological\nSo, denying folks their rights because of something they can't control seems inhuman to me\nI mean, it's not their fault\nAnd I've always been an advocate for it\n\nNo, I don't think politics or government should have any say in this\nIt's a personal thing, a household thing\nYou know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples\nNot married, of course, because they're not allowed to\nBut they function just like any other family\nThey walk their dogs down the street, just like anyone else\nAnd I think\nWith Bush trying to interpret marriage his way\nIt's kind of ridiculous\n\nI mean, I've read and heard from various sources\nThat it's something that might be a chemical thing in your brain\nSomething you're predisposed to, not something that's influenced by your upbringing\nYou know, like having several sisters and not having a father\nThat doesn't necessarily mean you'll be a homosexual\nSo that's the biological side, opposed to the sociological\n\nOther than that, the obvious part\nIs that if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone\nThey can just run off to Vegas and do it\nBut if two gay people want to get married, it's front-page news\nI think it should be a personal, private thing, not something that's public or national or federal\n\nNo, not at all",
            "Ah, um\nYou see, when you post something online, it's like, public domain\nIt's out there for everyone to see\nYou can't control it\nI mean, as a Resident Advisor, I've had to deal with this already\nYou put something out there\nIt can shape people's perception of you\nAnd if it's something like, you know, bomb threats or shootings\nSomeone's bound to report it\nYou can't just put that out there\nTo the world, you know\nThe internet's a public space\nIf you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin\nObviously, the school doesn't get it\nSomeone who's not supposed to does\nAnd they have to act on it\nBecause, you know, God forbid something happens, and they could have stopped it\nRight?\nBut then again, you don't know what to take seriously\nSome people just mess around\nIt could be an experiment gone wrong\nFor a sociology class or something\nSorry, my brain's a bit foggy today\nOr it could be something very serious\nAnyway, back to what happened at school\nSomething happened, and someone overheard someone saying something\nAnd they reported it\nWhen we finally found out who the person was, a friend of his looked through his Facebook\nAnd got worried because there were some things that he might have meant as a joke\nBut in light of the situation, it became very serious\nWhen you put something out into the public forum of the internet\nThere's no invasion of privacy\nIf you don't want it out there, don't put it there\nIf you don't want someone to think something of you, don't put it out there\nYou can't control what people think\nOr what they take seriously\nI mean, I don't think school officials should be friends with their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking\nAnd going through their profiles and all\nBut if it's brought to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy\nBecause it's brought by someone you gave access to\nAnd if there's danger, they have to take it seriously\nI mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs\nBut if it's brought to their attention, it's a whole different story\nUm\nYeah, like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or Myspace account under a different name to friend their students\nThat's just creepy\nI wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and posting their pictures on Facebook\nThen that pops up, and I have to see it and do something about it\nIt's not my place, so I don't even want that connection\nUm\nNot really",
            "Oh\nI feel like the conflict has been extended far too long\nThe initial objective was laudable\nTo restore democracy in a foreign land\nBut\nI believe we've lost sight of that objective\nAnd now\nIt seems we're simply engaged in the act of war somehow proving our might\nPerhaps the original motivations were murky\nInvolving George Bush's father's past grievances with Saddam Hussein\nBut\nIf the aim was to bestow democracy upon a nation lacking a fair political system, that would be justifiable\nBut\nI do think the cause has become muddied\nThe war has dragged on\nMonths, years, it feels like\nI believe we accomplished our purpose in the first few months, with the initial invasion\nBut\nThe protracted duration\nI just think it's overdone\nYeah\nIf our purpose was to instill democracy in a tyrannized land, that's a noble cause\nBut\nI don't think our reason has remained pure\nAnd\nThe conflict has become more about asserting dominance than aiding a people\nI think it's gone on long enough\nAnd it should cease\nI mean, there's a point when the local government must stand alone\nAnd I think that time has arrived\nWe've been siphoning our own economy, pouring billions into a war with questionable causes\nWhile our own country grapples with issues like poverty and lack of infrastructure\nUm\nThere's no denying we're spending billions\nAnd\nWar isn't a long-term budgetary priority\nThere are domestic concerns\nPublic works, healthcare\nWe could use that money here\nAt home\nWe're spending our resources on a war that's lost its purpose",
            "Can I ask a quick question? I'm not sure, but I feel like something was prevented because someone went online and found something. I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much for everyone to see, right? Myspace, for instance, you have to be a member to see someone's profile, and you usually need to be their friend. But if you accept them, then you're giving them permission to see it. So, anytime you put something online, you know a lot of people are going to see it. If someone saw something and prevented a life from being lost, that's a tough situation. I mean, I can't imagine just one person watching everyone's profiles all the time. But if it was for research or something, maybe that's different. I don't really know. I don't have a Myspace, but I do have Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there seeing my stuff. I heard a story about a guy who found someone's screen name and started talking to them. I personally wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who know my screen name even though I don't recognize them. It's weird because they can see my interests, my class schedule, and my friends. It's a tricky issue because I want to communicate with my friends, but I also want to protect my privacy. It's hard to balance. I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can look at what, so...",
            "Hmm\nUm\nI only have this and one more thing to say about the Iraq War\nUm\nI feel hypocritical discussing it\nLike, I hate to jump on the bandwagon of those who say they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but it doesn't really matter anymore\nBecause everywhere, except within the administration, the consensus was that it was a bad idea\nAnd, honestly\nUm\nYou just have to look at the polls\nUm\nEighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our troops think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI mean, it's been a complete mess from the start\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere's no easy way when dealing with the Middle East\nUm\nI mean, it's just the cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states\nToo big for any administration to understand\nAnd they think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist\nLike, that's not how a totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nUm\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy\nNo one's arguing that\nBut, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a disaster\nJust like quicksand\nUm\nI don't even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don't see a reason for us to stay\nUm\nThe administration might think some hopeful ideas why it's better to stay\nBut I don't agree\nI haven't heard a legitimate reason to stay any longer\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over a year or more\nUm\nI guess I wouldn't mind that\nBut, I just don't see a reason to stay now\nUm\nI mean, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and a quarter think we should just leave now\nAnd these are the people we're trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, they might know better than we do\nAnd at least if we ask and they say yes, it's not on us if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help afterward, at least we'll be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt'll be better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "You know, I do believe that gender discrimination is still very much an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It really depends on the particular field of work you're in. For instance, women often face a glass ceiling where, despite their qualifications, they may not get promoted because historically women haven't been in the upper echelons of the business world. And it's not just men who face this issue. Fatherhood at home is often frowned upon by society, which expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men are often not taken seriously, especially if they're straight, because of societal expectations about gender roles. So, depending on the field, gender discrimination is definitely a reality.\n\nChanging these perceptions is slow because society has deeply ingrained mindsets. While we've made progress from the 1800s, change takes time. Women rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs is a step forward, and men staying at home is becoming more accepted. But it's a slow process, and we have to continue working at it. Promoting the positive qualities of those who are stereotypically discriminated against can help, but we can't force change too quickly or people will resist. We need to be patient and let societal attitudes evolve naturally.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't just about gender. It can also be about one's background. If you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't perfect, but you're intelligent and work your way up to a CEO position, other men might judge you harshly. So, it's not just about gender but also about where you come from and how you fit into society's expectations.",
            "I guess they didn't make it legal, they just moved it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, like a traffic ticket. If you get caught, you'll get cited, but no jail time. But, job interviews might still be tough. Decriminalizing it doesn't erase past convictions, but it saves money. Arresting, booking, and housing people costs a lot, and so does the court process. Many communities won't decriminalize it due to drug policies and finances. However, in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's a non-issue, and the savings go to education, social programs, and food assistance. I'm not saying it should be everywhere, but the financial aspect is compelling. It shouldn't be like cigarettes, sold everywhere and smoked in public. It's still taboo in many places. Both alcohol and marijuana have adverse effects, but people react differently. Some handle it better than others. But they're both harmful, and it's hard to generalize.",
            "Well, I'd say yes\nBecause\nUm\nA lot of their ways are very traditional  ya know?\nLike they've done things the same way for ages\nAnd\nIt’s good to hold onto the old ways\nBut\nYou gotta be open to change too\nUm\nI reckon\nA lot of Catholics are stringent about attending church weekly\nAnd\nUm\nThey’ve got strict rules on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes  I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the rules to the letter\nAnd\nUm\nThey don't embrace others who aren't spotless Catholics\nAnd\nUm\nLike\nTake my parents for instance\nMy dad was Episcopal, my mom a Catholic\nAnd they weren’t married in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s faith\n\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s not really\nLike\nShowing tolerance to other religions\nUm\nWe were always taught to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic thing\nBut\nIt’s kinda hypocritical to preach love while not accepting others\nIn that way\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do certain things\nBut the actual practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would change it\nI mean\nI think it'd be wise to let priests marry\nBut\nUm\nI don’t think that’d stop them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nIt’s just a different plane of existence\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that’d be a problem\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest kids\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a kid which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re gonna do something like that\nYou’re probably gonna do it whether you’re married or not\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to marry would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think it’d happen regardless",
            "I've gotta be honest, I'm still undecided on this. It's a tricky topic, as you know, not far from the separation of church and state and how we define marriage. I can't definitively say who's right or wrong here, but I think we're treading on delicate ground.\n\nI mean, if all states can agree on a reasonable stance, then they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That's just absurd. Our constitution shouldn't be amended for something this divisive, even if it's important to some. It's just not big enough to warrant changing the constitution, especially to outlaw something as fundamental as marriage.",
            "You were raised in a Christian household, so this whole thing with homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for you. You have many gay friends and you understand that it's a lifestyle you might not personally agree with, but you do think it should be legalized. You don't believe it should be a national issue, and you'd prefer each state make its own decision. After all, it's not like the president lives in every state and should make decisions for the entire country. Most states are democratic or republican, and it makes sense that democratic states would push for gay marriage. If you live in a state that's democratic, you should respect that decision, as you chose to live there. It's not like you're from every single state, and Bush shouldn't get to decide how each one operates. He's just gonna be out of office in a couple of years. It's best to leave decisions like this up to individual states, as they're the ones who'll be dealing with the consequences. Plus, if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban, it'll just be back and forth. So, let's leave it to the states, alright?",
            "Now look, I don't really care\nI mean, school shootings are serious business\nYou know, when you're talking about kids' lives on the line, it's sorta important to keep an eye on things\nAnd if that means checking up on what students are doing on the internet, well, I get it\nI mean, it's a public space, right?\nSo if a kid is putting stuff out there that could get them in trouble, yeah, school officials have every right to check it out\nIt's not like they're just snooping for no reason\nThey're doing it to keep the school safe, you know?\nBut if they're just going on there to catch students in the act of doing something wrong, that's where it gets a bit shady\nIt starts feeling like an invasion of privacy\nBut if they're trying to stop something bad from happening, like a school shooting or something, well, that's a different story\nThey're just doing their job, making sure the school is a safer place\nAnd you know, it's a public thing, posting on the internet, so if you're not expecting to get in trouble, that's on you\nYou can't really complain about someone seeing what you've put out there\nAnd it's not just about posting on the internet\nIt's about the whole concept of privacy\nLike, if you send an email to someone and it gets lost or ends up in the wrong hands, it's out there forever\nYou can't take it back\nAnd if you don't watch what you say, it can come back to haunt you\nLike, one day you might end up being some big shot and then someone finds that old email you sent when you were a college student\nIt's a big world out there, and nothing really stays hidden for long\nSo if school officials are trying to keep the students safe, well, good for them\nAs long as they're not just doing it to catch someone in the act of doing something wrong\nThey're just doing their job, making sure the school is a safer place for everyone\nAnd I mean, who likes having those kinds of surprises come back to haunt you, right?",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Alright, so there are a few points where I think the Catholic Church needs to shift. I've heard they're losing some of their flock because they're not so accepting of various views. Take, for instance, issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stance on these is quite steadfast, which is fine, but it seems a bit outdated. If they could adopt a more contemporary viewpoint, they might not have to worry about dwindling attendance. I've noticed some people are starting to veer away from the Church due to their perspectives on these issues. It's like, if you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a denomination where that's considered wrong. The same goes for LGBTQ+ rights—if you strongly believe in them, you might not want to be part of a faith that doesn't agree. I don't see why female priests or married priests should be an issue, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented past scandals. Maybe they would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests, but it's hard to tell. I mean, it's not like priests are married to their work and nothing else—everyone's got a family life and other commitments. So why can't priests have that too?",
            "I'm not inherently opposed to same-sex marriage. Whether people are born gay or come to it later, I don't believe it's a choice or something they can consciously decide. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can't marry, but two people of the same sex can't either. It seems like they don't have a choice in who they are attracted to, just as I didn't choose to be straight. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who they are, and I don't think they should be punished or put on a stage for it. I don't think the government has any right to interject in people's personal lives. It's just how they're born, and it doesn't affect the security of our country. It's just them being themselves, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Honestly, there isn't a compelling reason not to. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's so much more complex than that. There are so many facets to it that it can't be equated to heterosexual relationships. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; heads and tails are not one and the same. Yet, in many respects, they are the same. Civil rights such as property taxes and healthcare are affected. A partner in a gay relationship can't be in the room with you if you're sick, can't visit you, because they're not technically considered family. That's absurd if you're spending the rest of your life together. Numerous scientific studies show that homosexual couples enjoy the same level of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, the same thing. The issue often lies in the fact that homosexuals aren't asking to marry in a church, but for a legal document from the government. If it's not about church or state, it shouldn't be an issue. I struggle to understand why people like Catholics can get hung up on it being against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriages? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They're the same in many ways - relationship roles played by different partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, children's adjustments, and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. But it's a new concept, hard to quantify. The main concern is how children are treated by peers and society. In New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and protests. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. They can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state. An amendment reversing the status quo is in order. President Bush has strong views on this, aligning with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. His reasons are mostly moral, but morality varies. It's unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It's hypocritical for the government to ban gay marriage while facing recent controversies like the \"under god\" pledge. Many are anti-gay because they believe homosexuals are psychologically damaged due to trauma or personality defects. The American Psychological Association debunks this, advising people to listen to actual research and institutions, not just neighbors and friends' opinions.",
            "So, well, I've been slinging pills at a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I gotta tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's all bad news. Take, for instance, oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are all controlled substances, but they've got their uses. I'd say keep them around for medicinal purposes. But just because something's illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. You get my drift? There are plenty of drugs that are illegal but have their place in medicine. Why should marijuana be any different? I think the taboo around it is holding us back, you know? It's not like heroine or cocaine—it's not all bad. We just need to remove that stigma and let people use it responsibly, maybe even medicinally. But maybe not all at once, we gotta ease into it. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, but both can be misused if you let them. Just gotta change the image of marijuana first, and then people might see it for what it can be.",

            "Haha\nInitially, I was alright with the concept, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we kind of stumbled into Iraq with some flimsy excuses.\nThe Bush administration tried to link Iraq to bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, all of which turned out to be false. That really set my teeth on edge, and the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just sheer malfeasance of office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th are astounding. It seems like they came into office with a war in mind.\nI can't recall the name of the treasury secretary who made this claim in his book after being forced out, but it appears that Bush Jr. was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein and maybe to increase our energy supply, all underhanded and dishonest. It's gone on long enough, but a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths. The UN and US are now considering a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that might not be ideal either, as it could cause long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The Interim government is crumbling, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister's grip on the political process is weak, and radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party holds significant influence. It's a mess, and I can't articulate my thoughts in polite company.",
            "Alright then, let's dive into this. You want to talk about the Iraq War, huh? Not sure I'm the best person for this. I mean, it's not like I have a degree in political science or anything. But, alright, let me give it a shot.\n\nMmm, okay, so what I feel about the whole Iraq War thing is that it's just kind of pointless. I mean, it's not like it was a proper war, you know? It was more like a bit of revenge for 9/11. They figured it was Iraq that did the attacks, so we went and got back at them. But, I mean, I'm not really into the whole war thing, so I don't keep up with all the details.\n\nBut what I do know is that we're over there trying to build some sort of democracy, right? And maybe we're after their oil too? But, you know, it's not really worth it. It's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and build this democracy, which is gonna take forever. And if we leave, they'll be pissed at us for messing everything up and they'll have to start over. It's a real mess.\n\nYou know, this is hard. I don't really know much about it. I just feel bad for George Bush because it's making him look like one of the worst presidents ever. It's like the Vietnam War all over again. It's like, why are we still there? We didn't even declare it a war, you know? We just went and did it.\n\nI mean, I don't think it's a real war anymore. I feel like we're just over there to show off our big guns and stuff. But I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it's not really a war, you know? It's just a big mess.\n\nBut then again, I feel bad for the families of the soldiers over there. It's not fair to them. They've got lives too, you know? And now their kids don't have a safe place to go to school. And all those different groups are just killing each other because of their beliefs.\n\nBut, if we stay, we're just gonna make things worse. We'll be trying to mold them into some sort of second United States, and it'll just make Al-Qaeda even worse. I don't think it's gonna end anytime soon. It's just gonna go on and on.\n\nThat's about it, I guess. It's a real confusing situation.",
            "Well, honestly, I think it's a bit much to try and make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I mean, it's all about respecting the constitution's clear separation of church and state. It's right there, as clear as day, and I believe that attempting to impose any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of our constitutional principles. So, I'm not convinced that it's up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to declare illegal or legal. I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, and I believe that this is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government. Separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our constitution, and any amendment trying to restrict it would be wrong and contradictory to our founding principles. I don't see why the federal government should be involved anyway. It seems like this is just a push from a Catholic perspective, and I don't see how it will impact the economy or society. If anything, it might have a positive impact. I've said my piece, I think.",
            "Real talk, the Iraq war\nWell, here we go from the start. I don't think the government was fully honest with the American people about the war's reason\nBefore invading Iraq, they attempted to connect the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but in reality, they weren't that linked\nThe government played on our emotions after the 9/11 attacks\nThe war began in 2003\nMe, I'm pretty much against war, especially preemptive strikes\nI think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the Vietnam War\nThe government should have learned from their past mistakes\nA ton of American soldiers died\nThey were removing the government and I don't think the American government was ready for what was to come\nThey removed the Iraqi government and tried to impose democracy, like they did in Vietnam to remove Communists\nThe government should have known it would be a long, tough process, not an easy victory\nWe're still there, almost 2006, and we're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces\nI think the government wasn't prepared and they tried to deceive us into thinking it would be a short, successful stay\nI mean, it's not easy to implement a new government and democracy was a struggle in our own country too\nI think the government made it seem like an easy task\nSo, the war in Iraq\nIt's a tough call\nI was thinking about the presidential election in 2004\nOne of my reasons for considering Bush was to finish what started, but now it's hard to leave after being there so long and having taken away their government\nWe can't just abandon them\nBut then there's the issue of the countless American casualties\nHow much more are we willing to risk for a democratic Iraq?\nGoing back to the reason for invading Iraq, why just Iraq?\nWhy not other countries?\nI think it's about oil, controlling resources\nAnd before the war, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found\nMeanwhile, places like North Korea, with known weapons, get a pass\nI don't think the government is being thorough or truthful enough with their decisions\nI just hope it ends soon, but probably not",
            "Alright, let's see\nI stand for um, I've always been for gay marriage\nIt's a personal preference, really\nIt's something that's been proven more and more to be biological, not sociological\nSo, denying folks their rights because of something they can't control seems inhuman to me\nI mean, it's not their fault\nAnd I've always been an advocate for it\n\nNo, I don't think politics or government should have any say in this\nIt's a personal thing, a household thing\nYou know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples\nNot married, of course, because they're not allowed to\nBut they function just like any other family\nThey walk their dogs down the street, just like anyone else\nAnd I think\nWith Bush trying to interpret marriage his way\nIt's kind of ridiculous\n\nI mean, I've read and heard from various sources\nThat it's something that might be a chemical thing in your brain\nSomething you're predisposed to, not something that's influenced by your upbringing\nYou know, like having several sisters and not having a father\nThat doesn't necessarily mean you'll be a homosexual\nSo that's the biological side, opposed to the sociological\n\nOther than that, the obvious part\nIs that if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone\nThey can just run off to Vegas and do it\nBut if two gay people want to get married, it's front-page news\nI think it should be a personal, private thing, not something that's public or national or federal\n\nNo, not at all",

            "Can I ask a quick question? I'm not sure, but I feel like something was prevented because someone went online and found something. I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much for everyone to see, right? Myspace, for instance, you have to be a member to see someone's profile, and you usually need to be their friend. But if you accept them, then you're giving them permission to see it. So, anytime you put something online, you know a lot of people are going to see it. If someone saw something and prevented a life from being lost, that's a tough situation. I mean, I can't imagine just one person watching everyone's profiles all the time. But if it was for research or something, maybe that's different. I don't really know. I don't have a Myspace, but I do have Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there seeing my stuff. I heard a story about a guy who found someone's screen name and started talking to them. I personally wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who know my screen name even though I don't recognize them. It's weird because they can see my interests, my class schedule, and my friends. It's a tricky issue because I want to communicate with my friends, but I also want to protect my privacy.

            "You know, I do believe that gender discrimination is still very much an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It really depends on the particular field of work you're in. For instance, women often face a glass ceiling where, despite their qualifications, they may not get promoted because historically women haven't been in the upper echelons of the business world. And it's not just men who face this issue. Fatherhood at home is often frowned upon by society, which expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men are often not taken seriously, especially if they're straight, because of societal expectations about gender roles. So, depending on the field, gender discrimination is definitely a reality.\n\nChanging these perceptions is slow because society has deeply ingrained mindsets. While we've made progress from the 1800s, change takes time. Women rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs is a step forward, and men staying at home is becoming more accepted. But it's a slow process, and we have to continue working at it. Promoting the positive qualities of those who are stereotypically discriminated against can help, but we can't force change too quickly or people will resist. We need to be patient and let societal attitudes evolve naturally.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't just about gender. It can also be about one's background. If you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't perfect, but you're intelligent and work your way up to a CEO position, other men might judge you harshly. So, it's not just about gender but also about where you come from and how you fit into society's expectations.",
            "I guess they didn't make it legal, they just moved it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, like a traffic ticket. If you get caught, you'll get cited, but no jail time. But, job interviews might still be tough. Decriminalizing it doesn't erase past convictions, but it saves money. Arresting, booking, and housing people costs a lot, and so does the court process. Many communities won't decriminalize it due to drug policies and finances. However, in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's a non-issue, and the savings go to education, social programs, and food assistance. I'm not saying it should be everywhere, but the financial aspect is compelling. It shouldn't be like cigarettes, sold everywhere and smoked in public. It's still taboo in many places. Both alcohol and marijuana have adverse effects, but people react differently. Some handle it better than others. But they're both harmful, and it's hard to generalize.",
            "Well, I'd say yes\nBecause\nUm\nA lot of their ways are very traditional  ya know?\nLike they've done things the same way for ages\nAnd\nIt’s good to hold onto the old ways\nBut\nYou gotta be open to change too\nUm\nI reckon\nA lot of Catholics are stringent about attending church weekly\nAnd\nUm\nThey’ve got strict rules on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes  I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the rules to the letter\nAnd\nUm\nThey don't embrace others who aren't spotless Catholics\nAnd\nUm\nLike\nTake my parents for instance\nMy dad was Episcopal, my mom a Catholic\nAnd they weren’t married in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s faith\n\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s not really\nLike\nShowing tolerance to other religions\nUm\nWe were always taught to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic thing\nBut\nIt’s kinda hypocritical to preach love while not accepting others\nIn that way\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do certain things\nBut the actual practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would change it\nI mean\nI think it'd be wise to let priests marry\nBut\nUm\nI don’t think that’d stop them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nIt’s just a different plane of existence\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that’d be a problem\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest kids\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a kid which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re gonna do something like that\nYou’re probably gonna do it whether you’re married or not\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to marry would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think it’d happen regardless",

I can't definitively say who's right or wrong here, but I think we're treading on delicate ground.\n\nI mean, if all states can agree on a reasonable stance, then they should push to make it federal law.

It's just not big enough to warrant changing the constitution, especially to outlaw something as fundamental as marriage.",
            "You were raised in a Christian household, so this whole thing with homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for you. You have many gay friends and you understand that it's a lifestyle you might not personally agree with, but you do think it should be legalized. You don't believe it should be a national issue, and you'd prefer each state make its own decision. After all, it's not like the president lives in every state and should make decisions for the entire country. Most states are democratic or republican, and it makes sense that democratic states would push for gay marriage. If you live in a state that's democratic, you should respect that decision, as you chose to live there. It's not like you're from every single state, and Bush shouldn't get to decide how each one operates. He's just gonna be out of office in a couple of years. It's best to leave decisions like this up to individual states, as they're the ones who'll be dealing with the consequences. Plus, if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban, it'll just be back and forth. So, let's leave it to the states, alright?",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "Alright, so there are a few points where I think the Catholic Church needs to shift. I've heard they're losing some of their flock because they're not so accepting of various views. Take, for instance, issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their stance on these is quite steadfast, which is fine, but it seems a bit outdated. If they could adopt a more contemporary viewpoint, they might not have to worry about dwindling attendance. I've noticed some people are starting to veer away from the Church due to their perspectives on these issues. It's like, if you're pro-choice, you might not feel comfortable in a denomination where that's considered wrong. The same goes for LGBTQ+ rights—if you strongly believe in them, you might not want to be part of a faith that doesn't agree. I don't see why female priests or married priests should be an issue, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented past scandals. Maybe they would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests, but it's hard to tell. I mean, it's not like priests are married to their work and nothing else—everyone's got a family life and other commitments. So why can't priests have that too?",
            "I'm not inherently opposed to same-sex marriage. Whether people are born gay or come to it later, I don't believe it's a choice or something they can consciously decide. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to hold gay people responsible for their sexual orientation. It's like saying a man and a woman can't marry, but two people of the same sex can't either. It seems like they don't have a choice in who they are attracted to, just as I didn't choose to be straight. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this, as it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just who they are, and I don't think they should be punished or put on a stage for it. I don't think the government has any right to interject in people's personal lives. It's just how they're born, and it doesn't affect the security of our country. It's just them being themselves, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Honestly, there isn't a compelling reason not to. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's so much more complex than that. There are so many facets to it that it can't be equated to heterosexual relationships. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; heads and tails are not one and the same. Yet, in many respects, they are the same. Civil rights such as property taxes and healthcare are affected. A partner in a gay relationship can't be in the room with you if you're sick, can't visit you, because they're not technically considered family. That's absurd if you're spending the rest of your life together. Numerous scientific studies show that homosexual couples enjoy the same level of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, the same thing. The issue often lies in the fact that homosexuals aren't asking to marry in a church, but for a legal document from the government. If it's not about church or state, it shouldn't be an issue. I struggle to understand why people like Catholics can get hung up on it being against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriages? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They're the same in many ways - relationship roles played by different partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, children's adjustments, and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. But it's a new concept, hard to quantify. The main concern is how children are treated by peers and society. In New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and protests. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight ones. They can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state. An amendment reversing the status quo is in order. President Bush has strong views on this, aligning with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. His reasons are mostly moral, but morality varies. It's unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It's hypocritical for the government to ban gay marriage while facing recent controversies like the \"under god\" pledge. Many are anti-gay because they believe homosexuals are psychologically damaged due to trauma or personality defects. The American Psychological Association debunks this, advising people to listen to actual research and institutions, not just neighbors and friends' opinions.",
            "So, well, I've been slinging pills at a hospital pharmacy this summer, and I gotta tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's all bad news. Take, for instance, oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those are all controlled substances, but they've got their uses. I'd say keep them around for medicinal purposes. But just because something's illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. You get my drift? There are plenty of drugs that are illegal but have their place in medicine. Why should marijuana be any different? I think the taboo around it is holding us back, you know? It's not like heroine or cocaine—it's not all bad. We just need to remove that stigma and let people use it responsibly, maybe even medicinally. But maybe not all at once, we gotta ease into it. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, but both can be misused if you let them. Just gotta change the image of marijuana first, and then people might see it for what it can be.",
            "Um\nI reckon the church has kinda adapted to the twenty-first century already\nUm\nNot as strict as it used to be\nI recall growing up, I'd always go to church every Sunday\nAnd\nI'd have these cute little dresses\nAnd\nMatching shoes\nAnd\nA matching purse\nBack then, I went to a private school\nAnd\nI'd see all my friends there on the weekends\nAnd\nWe'd just go\nBut\nNow, they've got this youth mass\nAnd\nThey cut it down to thirty minutes\nPeople are a lot more casual\nEspecially during the summer, you'd see people in beach clothes, straight from the beach\nAnd\nFamilies running in late\nSo yeah, it's become more chill\nEven at the morning masses where I used to get all dressed up\nPeople wear jeans and khakis now\nI mean, khakis are nice but\nA lot more casual\nAs for other things\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed\nLike\nThat's the church I know\nI don't know the politics, but\nYeah\nThat's it\n[OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or priests to marry?]\nUm\nI think these things couldn't have been avoided\nBecause\nThere are married men who still become pedophiles\nAnd\nThey still have an attraction towards young kids\nSo\nI think it's not about the marriage thing\nUm\nIt's more about the person\nUm\nThey choose to become a priest\nUm\nThere are religions where they're allowed to marry, like on Seventh Heaven\nI don't know if he's a reverend or a minister or something\nBut\nThey're allowed to marry\nSo\nI know it's different\nBut\nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and get married, they should maybe think about a different faith\n[OK, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm\nAbout which part?\n[Um]\nJust the changing ways\n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess]\nOh, on the pedophilia\n[Mm hmm]\nUm\nI think, like, the whole sexuality thing\nUm\nI think it's mostly genetics\nI don't think people just become it\nI think they're born that way\nI don't think it has much to do with how they're brought up\nIt might have a little more to do in this case\nBut\nI think it's their genetics\nAnd\nYou can't really hide that through marriage\nYou could try\nBut\nThen it usually comes out\nSo\nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening\nUm\nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them\nBut\nI don't think in all cases they knew\n[OK, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUm, no",
            "Haha\nInitially, I was alright with the concept, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and we kind of stumbled into Iraq with some flimsy excuses.\nThe Bush administration tried to link Iraq to bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, all of which turned out to be false. That really set my teeth on edge, and the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and never owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just sheer malfeasance of office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th are astounding. It seems like they came into office with a war in mind.\nI can't recall the name of the treasury secretary who made this claim in his book after being forced out, but it appears that Bush Jr. was driven by a desire for revenge against Saddam Hussein and maybe to increase our energy supply, all underhanded and dishonest. It's gone on long enough, but a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths. The UN and US are now considering a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but that might not be ideal either, as it could cause long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The Interim government is crumbling, and the Parliament seems ineffective. The Prime Minister's grip on the political process is weak, and radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party holds significant influence. It's a mess, and I can't articulate my thoughts in polite company.",
            "Alright then, let's dive into this. You want to talk about the Iraq War, huh? Not sure I'm the best person for this. I mean, it's not like I have a degree in political science or anything. But, alright, let me give it a shot.\n\nMmm, okay, so what I feel about the whole Iraq War thing is that it's just kind of pointless. I mean, it's not like it was a proper war, you know? It was more like a bit of revenge for 9/11. They figured it was Iraq that did the attacks, so we went and got back at them. But, I mean, I'm not really into the whole war thing, so I don't keep up with all the details.\n\nBut what I do know is that we're over there trying to build some sort of democracy, right? And maybe we're after their oil too? But, you know, it's not really worth it. It's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and build this democracy, which is gonna take forever. And if we leave, they'll be pissed at us for messing everything up and they'll have to start over. It's a real mess.\n\nYou know, this is hard. I don't really know much about it. I just feel bad for George Bush because it's making him look like one of the worst presidents ever. It's like the Vietnam War all over again. It's like, why are we still there? We didn't even declare it a war, you know? We just went and did it.\n\nI mean, I don't think it's a real war anymore. I feel like we're just over there to show off our big guns and stuff. But I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it's not really a war, you know? It's just a big mess.\n\nBut then again, I feel bad for the families of the soldiers over there. It's not fair to them. They've got lives too, you know? And now their kids don't have a safe place to go to school. And all those different groups are just killing each other because of their beliefs.\n\nBut, if we stay, we're just gonna make things worse. We'll be trying to mold them into some sort of second United States, and it'll just make Al-Qaeda even worse. I don't think it's gonna end anytime soon. It's just gonna go on and on.\n\nThat's about it, I guess. It's a real confusing situation.",
            "Well, honestly, I think it's a bit much to try and make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I mean, it's all about respecting the constitution's clear separation of church and state. It's right there, as clear as day, and I believe that attempting to impose any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of our constitutional principles. So, I'm not convinced that it's up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to declare illegal or legal. I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, and I believe that this is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government. Separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our constitution, and any amendment trying to restrict it would be wrong and contradictory to our founding principles. I don't see why the federal government should be involved anyway. It seems like this is just a push from a Catholic perspective, and I don't see how it will impact the economy or society. If anything, it might have a positive impact. I've said my piece, I think.",

I don't think the government was fully honest with the American people about the war's reason\nBefore invading Iraq, they attempted to connect the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but in reality, they weren't that linked\nThe government played on our emotions after the 9/11 attacks\nThe war began in 2003\nMe, I'm pretty much against war, especially preemptive strikes\nI think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the Vietnam War\nThe government should have learned from their past mistakes\nA ton of American soldiers died\nThey were removing the government and I don't think the American government was ready for what was to come\nThey removed the Iraqi government and tried to impose democracy, like they did in Vietnam to remove Communists\nThe government should have known it would be a long, tough process, not an easy victory\nWe're still there, almost 2006, and we're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces\nI think the government wasn't prepared and they tried to deceive us into thinking it would be a short, successful stay\nI mean, it's not easy to implement a new government and democracy was a struggle in our own country too\nI think the government made it seem like an easy task\nSo, the war in Iraq\nIt's a tough call\nI was thinking about the presidential election in 2004\nOne of my reasons for considering Bush was to finish what started, but now it's hard to leave after being there so long and having taken away their government\nWe can't just abandon them\nBut then there's the issue of the countless American casualties\nHow much more are we willing to risk for a democratic Iraq?\nGoing back to the reason for invading Iraq, why just Iraq?\nWhy not other countries?\nI think it's about oil, controlling resources\nAnd before the war, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found\nMeanwhile, places like North Korea, with known weapons, get a pass\nI don't think the government is being thorough or truthful enough with their decisions\nI just hope it ends soon, but probably not",

I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's pretty much for everyone to see, right? Myspace, for instance, you have to be a member to see someone's profile, and you usually need to be their friend. But if you accept them, then you're giving them permission to see it.

            "You know, I do believe that gender discrimination is still very much an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It really depends on the particular field of work you're in. For instance, women often face a glass ceiling where, despite their qualifications, they may not get promoted because historically women haven't been in the upper echelons of the business world. And it's not just men who face this issue. Fatherhood at home is often frowned upon by society, which expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men are often not taken seriously, especially if they're straight, because of societal expectations about gender roles. So, depending on the field, gender discrimination is definitely a reality.\n\nChanging these perceptions is slow because society has deeply ingrained mindsets. While we've made progress from the 1800s, change takes time. Women rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs is a step forward, and men staying at home is becoming more accepted. But it's a slow process, and we have to continue working at it. Promoting the positive qualities of those who are stereotypically discriminated against can help, but we can't force change too quickly or people will resist. We need to be patient and let societal attitudes evolve naturally.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't just about gender. It can also be about one's background. If you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't perfect, but you're intelligent and work your way up to a CEO position, other men might judge you harshly. So, it's not just about gender but also about where you come from and how you fit into society's expectations.",
            "I guess they didn't make it legal, they just moved it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, like a traffic ticket. If you get caught, you'll get cited, but no jail time. But, job interviews might still be tough. Decriminalizing it doesn't erase past convictions, but it saves money. Arresting, booking, and housing people costs a lot, and so does the court process. Many communities won't decriminalize it due to drug policies and finances. However, in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it's a non-issue, and the savings go to education, social programs, and food assistance. I'm not saying it should be everywhere, but the financial aspect is compelling. It shouldn't be like cigarettes, sold everywhere and smoked in public. It's still taboo in many places.

You don't believe it should be a national issue, and you'd prefer each state make its own decision. After all, it's not like the president lives in every state and should make decisions for the entire country. Most states are democratic or republican, and it makes sense that democratic states would push for gay marriage. If you live in a state that's democratic, you should respect that decision, as you chose to live there. It's not like you're from every single state, and Bush shouldn't get to decide how each one operates. He's just gonna be out of office in a couple of years. It's best to leave decisions like this up to individual states, as they're the ones who'll be dealing with the consequences. Plus, if a democratic president comes in and lifts the ban, it'll just be back and forth. So, let's leave it to the states, alright?",
            "Now look, I don't really care\nI mean, school shootings are serious business\nYou know, when you're talking about kids' lives on the line, it's sorta important to keep an eye on things\nAnd if that means checking up on what students are doing on the internet, well, I get it\nI mean, it's a public space, right?\nSo if a kid is putting stuff out there that could get them in trouble, yeah, school officials have every right to check it out\nIt's not like they're just snooping for no reason\nThey're doing it to keep the school safe, you know?\nBut if they're just going on there to catch students in the act of doing something wrong, that's where it gets a bit shady\nIt starts feeling like an invasion of privacy\nBut if they're trying to stop something bad from happening, like a school shooting or something, well, that's a different story\nThey're just doing their job, making sure the school is a safer place\nAnd you know, it's a public thing, posting on the internet, so if you're not expecting to get in trouble, that's on you\nYou can't really complain about someone seeing what you've put out there\nAnd it's not just about posting on the internet\nIt's about the whole concept of privacy\nLike, if you send an email to someone and it gets lost or ends up in the wrong hands, it's out there forever\nYou can't take it back\nAnd if you don't watch what you say, it can come back to haunt you\nLike, one day you might end up being some big shot and then someone finds that old email you sent when you were a college student\nIt's a big world out there, and nothing really stays hidden for long\nSo if school officials are trying to keep the students safe, well, good for them\nAs long as they're not just doing it to catch someone in the act of doing something wrong\nThey're just doing their job, making sure the school is a safer place for everyone\nAnd I mean, who likes having those kinds of surprises come back to haunt you, right?",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nInitially, I was all for it. The events of nine eleven had a profound personal impact on me.\nUm\nAt first, I was all for going there and causing as much disruption as they did to us.\nUm\nI believe that, due to the emotional nature of the event, we overlooked many things and didn't consider the long-term implications.\nAnd we went over there unprepared, without a well-thought-out plan.\nUm\nI really think it backfired on us.\nUm\nI don’t know\nI was all for it initially,\nBut now I’m very against it.\nI don’t think it has achieved anything.\nUm\nI think the people over there,\nAs long as they’re fighting among themselves, they can’t fight against us too.\nLike, I don’t think our presence over there will help if they can’t even get along.\nSo um\nLike, unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone one definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"
