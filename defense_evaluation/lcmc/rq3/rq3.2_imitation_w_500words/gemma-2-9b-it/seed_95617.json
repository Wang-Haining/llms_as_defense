            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmm, I think the Catholic Church could use a little update, you know?  People are saying it's losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things. Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that they have strong beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past. If they were a bit more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't be worried about people leaving.  I've heard folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these issues.  They just don't see eye to eye.  For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might feel uncomfortable being part of a group that says it's completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not feel welcome in a place that opposes it. Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or priests who are married.  But who knows if that would have stopped the recent scandals?  It's hard to say for sure. Maybe they would have done it anyway.  It's just weird that they expect priests to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.  It seems unfair.",
            "Mmm, okay. See, personally, I'm totally cool with gay people getting married.  I mean, whether someone is born that way or, you know, whatever, I just don't think it's something you choose, right? So, I don't think we should blame people for how they feel about who they love. It just seems wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really spent a lot of time thinking about it, but yeah, I definitely think it's wrong to say that.\n\nIt's kind of like, you know, I was born straight, and some people are born gay. It doesn't seem like a choice you make. They shouldn't have to feel bad about who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to treat them differently. Honestly, I don't think the government should get involved. It's not really a legal issue, or even a big moral issue. I don't think it's fair to put them on display like they made a mistake or something.\n\nSo, I don't think the government should have a say in it.\n\nIt's a bit tricky, you know?\n\n(laughs)  \n\nOkay, well, I just don't think the government should get involved because it's not like it affects our country's safety or anything. It's not like a moral issue. It just seems like they're overstepping.  They shouldn't be telling people how to live their lives. It's just who they are, you know? And they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "So, I think gay marriage should be totally legal, you know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are bad news for traditional families, but it's just not the same thing at all. It's like two sides of the same coin – different but connected.  Plus, there are tons of rights that come with marriage, like healthcare and property stuff. Imagine if your partner couldn't be with you in the hospital because they're not officially family. That's messed up, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same stuff that makes relationships work. They're just in love, just like everyone else. It's all about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nWhat really bugs me is the whole church and state thing. Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal marriage certificate from the government. If the government isn't getting involved in religion, then what's the big deal? \n\nIt's like saying no to civil unions but yes to marriage. That's just unfair. It's like segregation – separate but not equal.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and community stuff, but honestly, it's all about individual families, not just being gay.  Gay parents can be just as good as straight parents.  And those kids deserve the same love and support as any other kid.\n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It should be a right for everyone.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and you know, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Like, I think making it available to everyone, nah, not a good idea. But for medicine, I'm all for it.  Just 'cause it's against the law doesn't mean it can't be helpful, right?\n\nI mean, think about it, pharmacies use all kinds of drugs that are illegal, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet - those are serious stuff, but they're super useful for people.  If we can't see the good in marijuana just because it's got a bad reputation, that's not right. We gotta be open to its benefits.\n\nIt's different from alcohol, though.  Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and marijuana can too, but I think the key is to approach it slowly. Making it legal all at once might lead to problems, but if we start by getting rid of the stigma, maybe people will use it responsibly.\n\nPeople think marijuana is this terrible drug just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine. It's not that harmful. If we change how people see it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Hmm...the church, it's changed a lot since I was a little girl. It's not as strict anymore. Back then, I was always going to Sunday mass, all dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes and purses. It was every Sunday, you know, even when I went to private school. I'd see all my friends there on the weekends. \n\nBut now, things are different. They have this special mass for teenagers, just thirty minutes long, and people dress super casual. Even in the summer, some come straight from the beach! Families are always rushing in late. It's a lot more relaxed even at the morning masses.  I used to get all dressed up for those, but now people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's the church I know now. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but yeah, that's it.",
            "(laughs) \nYou know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still really shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration kept saying the war was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction – which, by the way, turned out to be completely untrue. \nThat really rubs me the wrong way. Honestly, the whole Iraq war just makes me furious. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, after giving that big presentation at the UN, has said he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious abuse of power – it's practically grounds for impeachment.  \nThey just seem to have no respect for the Constitution and have been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. They came into office with a plan to go to war, it seems like.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – who basically said that in his book after they kicked him out. It felt like Bush Jr. had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably also wanted to secure our energy supply by controlling the region. That's a pretty shady way to go about things.\n\nHonestly, it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would be messy, though. There's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and even more people would die.  \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to step in and restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It'll probably create more problems down the road because it undermines Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting recently, now has a bunch of seats in Parliament.  There are all these different groups fighting for power, and it's just creating a lot of chaos.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting too graphic.",
            "Ugh, this whole thing about the war in Iraq is such a mess. To be honest, I don’t even know where to begin. It feels pointless because it wasn’t officially declared a war, you know? It just seems like a way for us to get back at them for 9/11, like they were the only ones who could have possibly done it.\n\nHonestly, I’m not really into keeping up with all the details of the war. But I get the feeling we’re just staying there to try and build a democracy that’s more like the U.S. and to get their oil.  \n\nThe problem is, it’s making everyone upset, both there and here.  It’s like, if we stay, we’ll try to force democracy on them, but that takes forever. And if we leave, they’ll be angry because they’ll feel like we messed everything up and they have to start over. \n\nIt’s so complicated. It feels like there’s no good answer. \n\nI guess maybe it’s better to stay and help them, but it’s also a waste of resources. And it’s making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation. \n\nIt’s hard because I know families who have loved ones over there, and I want them to be safe. But then there are all these Iraqi families who have lost everything because of the fighting. It’s heartbreaking.\n\nIt’s like trying to change their culture to be more like ours, but that might make things even worse. It could make them hate us more.\n\nThis whole thing is just going to drag on and on. Ugh.",
            "Okay, so, I just don't think it's right for the government to get involved in making this legal or illegal. Like, the Constitution clearly says there should be separation of church and state, right? So trying to force a law on this would go against that.  It's like picking one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it's not the government's place to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important to religious freedom in America. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, that would be totally wrong. It would be one of the few amendments that limits people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI definitely don't think the government should be involved at all.  This guy pushing for an amendment is just trying to push his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government. There's no good reason for an amendment except for his personal views. I don't see how it would hurt the economy or anything – maybe even help!",
            "Okay, so let me tell you about this whole Iraq war thing.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th attacks, but really, they weren't that connected. The government made it seem like they were, though, using everyone's anger and fear from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made there.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't really prepared for what would happen after.  They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt, or how hard it would be to rebuild. It's like what they tried to do in Vietnam - pushing out Communists and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut the US government should have known it wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and it's not always a clear victory.  Vietnam was a loss, even if some people supported us. It's hard to win when you're fighting the entire population, not a regular army.\n\nSo, I think the government made a huge mistake going into this war. Even if you decide to go to war, you need to be prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government, and now we're still there years later.  \n\nThey made it seem like it would be a quick and successful mission, but that's just not how it works. Building a new government takes time and effort, just like it did in our own country.  It's not a simple fix.\n\nIt's really tough because we've been there for so long now. How can we just abandon these people after we took away their government and way of life?  But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, it seems like this whole thing might be about oil. We're getting our oil from there, after all. It's all about money and resources. We were also told Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though we know they have weapons.  \n\nI don't think the US government is being honest with us about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure it will.",
            "Hmm... let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage. Always have been. It's something deeply personal, don't you think? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just a choice. It wouldn't be fair to take away someone's rights just because they're born a certain way, right? That seems kind of cruel.\n\nI've always been on the side of equality for everyone. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's about love and commitment, things that happen at home, in families.\n\nLike, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples. They're not married, of course, because the law doesn't allow it. But they live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, going about their day. Why should it matter?\n\nIt's like Bush trying to play God and decide what marriage means. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nYou know, I've read a lot about how there might be a chemical difference in the brains of gay people. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose. Like, maybe having lots of sisters and no brothers doesn't make you gay, right?\n\nExcept for the obvious reasons, it's kind of unfair. If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas and no one would even know. But if two gay people want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It's like it should be a private matter, not something everyone else needs to know about. It's their relationship, not the government's business.",

It's the same online.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's for everyone.\n\nSchools have to act when they hear something concerning, even if it's just a rumor. They can't just ignore it and hope for the best.  What if something bad happens? They'd regret not taking action.  \n\nOf course, not everything online is serious. Sometimes people joke around, but it's tricky to tell the difference.  It's like that time we had at school where a harmless experiment went wrong and everyone panicked.  But sometimes, those online posts can be really serious, too. \n\nThere was this one case where someone overheard a conversation at school, and they reported it.  When they looked at the person's Facebook, they found some things that seemed harmless at first but became really worrying given the situation.\n\nSo, basically, once you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see.  Think before you post!  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online.  You can't control how people interpret it, but you can control what you share.",
            "This war feels like it's dragged on way too long. I get that the starting point had good intentions – helping another country get democracy. But I feel like we've forgotten that original goal. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove how powerful we are.  Plus, I think there were some questionable reasons for starting the war in the first place, like maybe old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  \n\nIf the goal was truly to give democracy to a country without fair politics, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, it wouldn't be fair.  \n\nI think we made our point in the early days of the war. That was a statement in itself. But the fact that it's been going on for years now just seems excessive.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that's a noble reason to fight. But I think our purpose has become muddled over time. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to win a decisive victory.\n\nThis war has lasted long enough. It's time for their government and people to take charge. We've been spending billions of dollars, draining our own economy, when we have problems here at home like poverty and crumbling infrastructure that need attention. That money could be better spent on improving our own lives.\n\nWe can't be in a constant state of war. There are so many other important things we need to focus on, like education, healthcare, and fixing our roads. It's heartbreaking to see money being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost sight of.",
            "Let me ask something, can you explain how this was stopped?  Someone looked online and saw something, right? Okay, I don't think that's bad. On sites like Myspace, if you put something online, anyone can see it.  I know on Myspace you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you've chosen to be friends with them, so they can see it. So, whenever you put things online, you have to understand that lots of people will see it. If someone saw something and could stop something bad from happening, I think that’s good.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day.  It would feel discriminatory to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job to just look at people's profiles. I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. It makes me uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a news story about a man who showed how easy it is to find information about people online. He found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet him. I wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they know my interests, what I look like, when I'm in class, and who my friends are. They can see lots of photos. I try to limit what I share, but it's hard because Facebook is for connecting with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who is looking at your profile.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace, and I thought that was strange. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I don't know if it's really a privacy issue, but I don't know how they have the right to tell people what they can and can't do. That's all I can think of.",
            "Hmm, you know... This whole Iraq War thing, it's a tough one for me. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, like everyone else who's suddenly against it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not like my opinion really matters now.  It's just... everyone knows it was a bad idea, except, well, the people in charge who don't want to admit they messed up.  \n\nSeriously, look at the polls! Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the whole world, people are saying it was a mistake.  Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the US troops over there, they all think we should get out. \n\nFrom the beginning, it was a disaster. And now pulling out? That's a disaster too.  The Middle East is just so complicated. It's like there's this huge gap between our way of life and theirs.  We can't just force democracy on them like it's some magic solution.  I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt. But invading a country and making it a total mess?  That's not the answer.\n\nI just don't get why we're still there. What's the point? I haven't heard any good reasons for staying. Sure, they might have some ideas, but I don't buy it.\n\nIf we're going to leave, let's just do it.  Maybe a year, maybe a little longer, but let's get out.  The Iraqi people are telling us to leave. They're the ones we're trying to help, right? Maybe they know best. \n\nAt least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" we can't be blamed if things go south. We'll be able to say, \"Hey, you asked us to leave.\"",
            "You know, I really think gender bias is still a thing in the United States.  It's not just women who face it, though. It seems to depend on what field you're in.  \n\nOverall, I feel like women have a tougher time because of this invisible barrier, this \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, a lot of people struggle with the idea of working under a woman. Society has been this way for so long, you know?  \n\nSo, women often see a job they're totally qualified for, but maybe the board won't promote them because historically, women aren't usually in leadership roles in business. \n\nThe same goes for men in certain fields, like parenting at home. It's uncommon to see a dad stay home while his wife works. People often judge that, thinking \"You're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  It can be tough on these dads when maybe they've always dreamed of being at home with their kids, and their wife is happy with her job.  \n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Sometimes, straight men aren't taken seriously there. Maybe it's because people assume fashion is \"for women.\" If a guy doesn't fit the typical \"fashion guy\" stereotype, people might question his knowledge.\n\nIt really depends on the industry.  I think gender discrimination exists in the US, but changing it is slow.  We've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is gradual. We need to keep pushing, though. Women are climbing into leadership positions, and even stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. It's happening, just slowly.\n\nMaybe we need to show the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. Not be too pushy, but highlight their strengths. If we force change, people resist. We're kind of at a good point where things are naturally shifting.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it completely legal, they just took it out of the criminal category. Now, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket. You know, you get a citation, but you don't get arrested and hauled into court.  I think if someone gets caught, it still might affect them when they're applying for jobs and stuff like that. Those consequences are usually the worst part of having a drug charge, especially for marijuana.  Lots of people worry about the future repercussions even after it's decriminalized.\n\nBut, there's an argument that it's really expensive to arrest people, hold them in jail, and process their cases.  Funding lawyers, court appearances, and prosecution all costs a lot of money.  Places with tight budgets might not want to give up that revenue even if it frees up resources. \n\nSome places are against marijuana and won't give ground on that, even if it could save money. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might make sense. Denver could use the saved money for things like education, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still kind of taboo in a lot of places, so having it out in the open could be awkward.  Plus, we don't know how it would affect driving and things like that.   Alcohol affects your motor skills more obviously, but marijuana can really mess with people's lives, not just their judgment.\n\nBoth substances have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people handle things well, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize, but they both have their downsides.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yeah, but... there are things about traditional Catholicism that both appeal and bother me.  Like, they stick to things the way they've always been done, which can be good for stability, you know? But it also feels kinda stuck in the past.  Things change, and sometimes the Church seems resistant to that.  \n\nIt feels like a lot of Catholics are expected to follow all the rules super strictly, and they can be harsh on people who don't perfectly fit the mold.  They don't seem very welcoming to folks from different faiths either.  \n\nThink of my parents – my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic church! How's that for loving thy neighbor? It's a real contradiction, you know? They preach love but then turn their backs on people who aren't exactly like them.\n\nThe teachings feel great, but the way things are actually done doesn't always match up. It's like they're stuck in the past, clinging to outdated ideas.\n\nNow, some people think allowing priests to marry would solve problems, but I'm not so sure.  It wouldn't necessarily stop anyone from doing bad things.  It's a different kind of issue altogether.  \n\nPeople who hurt kids, they're going to hurt kids, married or not. It's about them, not about their relationship status.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage... I'm still figuring it out.  I can't really say who's right or wrong, but it's definitely tough. It's like trying to balance the church and the government, you know?  And figuring out what marriage really means without upsetting anyone is a real challenge.  I think maybe we should just see all unions as civil partnerships.  Like, why does the government care what kind of ceremony people have?  If you're baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right? Same with marriage.  It's just two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in deciding what kind of marriage is valid.  Just two people, that's all that matters. \n\nAnd gay marriage... well,  it's the same thing!   Just two people wanting to be together. \n\nIf the states can all agree on something fair, they should make it a national law. But changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage is crazy!  The Constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people have strong feelings about it. It's not something that important.",
            "Hmm...my upbringing was Christian, so homosexuality is kinda tricky for me. See, I have lots of gay friends, ya know? I don't exactly agree with their lifestyle, but I think they should be allowed to marry. It shouldn't be a big national deal, though. Each state should get to decide, not the president making rules for everyone.\n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, right? So, if you live in a state that's okay with it, you gotta respect their choice, ya know? Like, you chose to live there! \n\nBasically, I think gay folks deserve the same chances as straight folks. So, legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already kinda answered this, but yeah, I don't think Bush should be able to say the whole country has to be against gay marriage. States should decide for themselves. I don't like his ban on it.\n\nIt just doesn't seem right. Bush doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to say what they can or can't do? Some things should be left up to the states, ya know? Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president wants to change things, it'll just become a back-and-forth.\n\nIt should just be up to the states because they're the ones who have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, here's the thing about Myspace. It's like, it's public, right? It's a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you put something on there, you gotta expect people to see it. Like, even if it's not under the school's name, they could still find it. Think about it, people can check Myspace at home.\n\nNow, if the school is looking at Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like a shooting, I think that's okay. Their job is to keep students safe, and if that means looking at Myspace, well, that's what they gotta do. \n\nBut here's the thing about them going on Myspace just to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels different. That's like an invasion of privacy, you know? \n\nIt's just that, if they're trying to make the school safer, and maybe even save lives, I think it's worth it. \n\nIt's a bit tricky, though.  Like, it's easier to think things through when you're writing, right?  I mean, even emails, I'm careful about what I say. You never know who might read it later.\n\nThings you post online, they stay online forever.  It's like, once it's out there, there's no taking it back.\n\nSo yeah, I think if the school's looking at Myspace to prevent something bad, it's okay. But if they're just snooping around, that's a problem.",
            "Okay, so, you know, after 9/11, I was all for getting involved. I felt it personally, and I wanted to hit them hard, just like they hit us. But looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. We didn't really think things through, and we went into it unprepared. It just backfired.\n\nHonestly, I was for it at first, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think we've accomplished anything. See, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting with us.  It's like, what's the point of us being there if they can't even get along?\n\nBecause of 9/11, I've just lost interest in what happens over there. They're a mess, always fighting, always at each other's throats. I just don't get them.\n\nThe truth is, we went in unprepared. We didn't know what to expect. And war is different there. They're brutal, savage. I don't think they're trying to better their country; they just want us out.\n\nAnd maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave. We were all hyped up, looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it. He felt like he had to do something, I get it.\n\nBut it all felt wrong. We should have had a plan, a clear strategy for what we were going to do. There was no unity, no purpose. It was just emotions and anger driving us. That's all we created over there - more anger.\n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're always going to be like that. It's been too long, and we're not making enough progress. We've made some, sure, but not enough to justify staying.  We can't stay there forever. We're just hurting ourselves."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmm, I think the Catholic Church could use a little update, you know?  People are saying it's losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things. Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that they have strong beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past. If they were a bit more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't be worried about people leaving.  I've heard folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these issues.  They just don't see eye to eye.  For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might feel uncomfortable being part of a group that says it's completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not feel welcome in a place that opposes it. Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or priests who are married.  But who knows if that would have stopped the recent scandals?  It's hard to say for sure. Maybe they would have done it anyway.  It's just weird that they expect priests to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.  It seems unfair.",
            "Mmm, okay. See, personally, I'm totally cool with gay people getting married.  I mean, whether someone is born that way or, you know, whatever, I just don't think it's something you choose, right? So, I don't think we should blame people for how they feel about who they love. It just seems wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really spent a lot of time thinking about it, but yeah, I definitely think it's wrong to say that.\n\nIt's kind of like, you know, I was born straight, and some people are born gay. It doesn't seem like a choice you make. They shouldn't have to feel bad about who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to treat them differently. Honestly, I don't think the government should get involved. It's not really a legal issue, or even a big moral issue. I don't think it's fair to put them on display like they made a mistake or something.\n\nSo, I don't think the government should have a say in it.\n\nIt's a bit tricky, you know?\n\n(laughs)  \n\nOkay, well, I just don't think the government should get involved because it's not like it affects our country's safety or anything. It's not like a moral issue. It just seems like they're overstepping.  They shouldn't be telling people how to live their lives. It's just who they are, you know? And they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "So, I think gay marriage should be totally legal, you know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are bad news for traditional families, but it's just not the same thing at all. It's like two sides of the same coin – different but connected.  Plus, there are tons of rights that come with marriage, like healthcare and property stuff. Imagine if your partner couldn't be with you in the hospital because they're not officially family. That's messed up, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same stuff that makes relationships work. They're just in love, just like everyone else. It's all about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nWhat really bugs me is the whole church and state thing. Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal marriage certificate from the government. If the government isn't getting involved in religion, then what's the big deal? \n\nIt's like saying no to civil unions but yes to marriage. That's just unfair. It's like segregation – separate but not equal.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and community stuff, but honestly, it's all about individual families, not just being gay.  Gay parents can be just as good as straight parents.  And those kids deserve the same love and support as any other kid.\n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It should be a right for everyone.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and you know, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Like, I think making it available to everyone, nah, not a good idea. But for medicine, I'm all for it.  Just 'cause it's against the law doesn't mean it can't be helpful, right?\n\nI mean, think about it, pharmacies use all kinds of drugs that are illegal, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet - those are serious stuff, but they're super useful for people.  If we can't see the good in marijuana just because it's got a bad reputation, that's not right. We gotta be open to its benefits.\n\nIt's different from alcohol, though.  Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and marijuana can too, but I think the key is to approach it slowly. Making it legal all at once might lead to problems, but if we start by getting rid of the stigma, maybe people will use it responsibly.\n\nPeople think marijuana is this terrible drug just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine. It's not that harmful. If we change how people see it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Hmm...the church, it's changed a lot since I was a little girl. It's not as strict anymore. Back then, I was always going to Sunday mass, all dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes and purses. It was every Sunday, you know, even when I went to private school. I'd see all my friends there on the weekends. \n\nBut now, things are different. They have this special mass for teenagers, just thirty minutes long, and people dress super casual. Even in the summer, some come straight from the beach! Families are always rushing in late. It's a lot more relaxed even at the morning masses.  I used to get all dressed up for those, but now people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's the church I know now. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but yeah, that's it.",
            "(laughs) \nYou know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still really shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration kept saying the war was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction – which, by the way, turned out to be completely untrue. \nThat really rubs me the wrong way. Honestly, the whole Iraq war just makes me furious. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, after giving that big presentation at the UN, has said he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious abuse of power – it's practically grounds for impeachment.  \nThey just seem to have no respect for the Constitution and have been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. They came into office with a plan to go to war, it seems like.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – who basically said that in his book after they kicked him out. It felt like Bush Jr. had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably also wanted to secure our energy supply by controlling the region. That's a pretty shady way to go about things.\n\nHonestly, it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would be messy, though. There's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and even more people would die.  \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to step in and restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It'll probably create more problems down the road because it undermines Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting recently, now has a bunch of seats in Parliament.  There are all these different groups fighting for power, and it's just creating a lot of chaos.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting too graphic.",
            "Ugh, this whole thing about the war in Iraq is such a mess. To be honest, I don’t even know where to begin. It feels pointless because it wasn’t officially declared a war, you know? It just seems like a way for us to get back at them for 9/11, like they were the only ones who could have possibly done it.\n\nHonestly, I’m not really into keeping up with all the details of the war. But I get the feeling we’re just staying there to try and build a democracy that’s more like the U.S. and to get their oil.  \n\nThe problem is, it’s making everyone upset, both there and here.  It’s like, if we stay, we’ll try to force democracy on them, but that takes forever. And if we leave, they’ll be angry because they’ll feel like we messed everything up and they have to start over. \n\nIt’s so complicated. It feels like there’s no good answer. \n\nI guess maybe it’s better to stay and help them, but it’s also a waste of resources. And it’s making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation. \n\nIt’s hard because I know families who have loved ones over there, and I want them to be safe. But then there are all these Iraqi families who have lost everything because of the fighting. It’s heartbreaking.\n\nIt’s like trying to change their culture to be more like ours, but that might make things even worse. It could make them hate us more.\n\nThis whole thing is just going to drag on and on. Ugh.",
            "Okay, so, I just don't think it's right for the government to get involved in making this legal or illegal. Like, the Constitution clearly says there should be separation of church and state, right? So trying to force a law on this would go against that.  It's like picking one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it's not the government's place to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important to religious freedom in America. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, that would be totally wrong. It would be one of the few amendments that limits people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI definitely don't think the government should be involved at all.  This guy pushing for an amendment is just trying to push his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government. There's no good reason for an amendment except for his personal views. I don't see how it would hurt the economy or anything – maybe even help!",
            "Okay, so let me tell you about this whole Iraq war thing.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th attacks, but really, they weren't that connected. The government made it seem like they were, though, using everyone's anger and fear from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made there.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't really prepared for what would happen after.  They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt, or how hard it would be to rebuild. It's like what they tried to do in Vietnam - pushing out Communists and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut the US government should have known it wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and it's not always a clear victory.  Vietnam was a loss, even if some people supported us. It's hard to win when you're fighting the entire population, not a regular army.\n\nSo, I think the government made a huge mistake going into this war. Even if you decide to go to war, you need to be prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government, and now we're still there years later.  \n\nThey made it seem like it would be a quick and successful mission, but that's just not how it works. Building a new government takes time and effort, just like it did in our own country.  It's not a simple fix.\n\nIt's really tough because we've been there for so long now. How can we just abandon these people after we took away their government and way of life?  But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, it seems like this whole thing might be about oil. We're getting our oil from there, after all. It's all about money and resources. We were also told Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though we know they have weapons.  \n\nI don't think the US government is being honest with us about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure it will.",
            "Hmm... let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage. Always have been. It's something deeply personal, don't you think? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just a choice. It wouldn't be fair to take away someone's rights just because they're born a certain way, right? That seems kind of cruel.\n\nI've always been on the side of equality for everyone. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's about love and commitment, things that happen at home, in families.\n\nLike, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples. They're not married, of course, because the law doesn't allow it. But they live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, going about their day. Why should it matter?\n\nIt's like Bush trying to play God and decide what marriage means. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nYou know, I've read a lot about how there might be a chemical difference in the brains of gay people. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose. Like, maybe having lots of sisters and no brothers doesn't make you gay, right?\n\nExcept for the obvious reasons, it's kind of unfair. If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas and no one would even know. But if two gay people want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It's like it should be a private matter, not something everyone else needs to know about. It's their relationship, not the government's business.",

It's the same online.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's for everyone.\n\nSchools have to act when they hear something concerning, even if it's just a rumor. They can't just ignore it and hope for the best.  What if something bad happens? They'd regret not taking action.  \n\nOf course, not everything online is serious. Sometimes people joke around, but it's tricky to tell the difference.  It's like that time we had at school where a harmless experiment went wrong and everyone panicked.  But sometimes, those online posts can be really serious, too. \n\nThere was this one case where someone overheard a conversation at school, and they reported it.  When they looked at the person's Facebook, they found some things that seemed harmless at first but became really worrying given the situation.\n\nSo, basically, once you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see.  Think before you post!  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online.  You can't control how people interpret it, but you can control what you share.",
            "This war feels like it's dragged on way too long. I get that the starting point had good intentions – helping another country get democracy. But I feel like we've forgotten that original goal. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove how powerful we are.  Plus, I think there were some questionable reasons for starting the war in the first place, like maybe old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  \n\nIf the goal was truly to give democracy to a country without fair politics, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, it wouldn't be fair.  \n\nI think we made our point in the early days of the war. That was a statement in itself. But the fact that it's been going on for years now just seems excessive.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that's a noble reason to fight. But I think our purpose has become muddled over time. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to win a decisive victory.\n\nThis war has lasted long enough. It's time for their government and people to take charge. We've been spending billions of dollars, draining our own economy, when we have problems here at home like poverty and crumbling infrastructure that need attention. That money could be better spent on improving our own lives.\n\nWe can't be in a constant state of war. There are so many other important things we need to focus on, like education, healthcare, and fixing our roads. It's heartbreaking to see money being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost sight of.",
            "Let me ask something, can you explain how this was stopped?  Someone looked online and saw something, right? Okay, I don't think that's bad. On sites like Myspace, if you put something online, anyone can see it.  I know on Myspace you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you've chosen to be friends with them, so they can see it. So, whenever you put things online, you have to understand that lots of people will see it. If someone saw something and could stop something bad from happening, I think that’s good.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day.  It would feel discriminatory to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job to just look at people's profiles. I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. It makes me uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a news story about a man who showed how easy it is to find information about people online. He found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet him. I wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they know my interests, what I look like, when I'm in class, and who my friends are. They can see lots of photos. I try to limit what I share, but it's hard because Facebook is for connecting with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who is looking at your profile.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace, and I thought that was strange. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I don't know if it's really a privacy issue, but I don't know how they have the right to tell people what they can and can't do. That's all I can think of.",
            "Hmm, you know... This whole Iraq War thing, it's a tough one for me. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, like everyone else who's suddenly against it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not like my opinion really matters now.  It's just... everyone knows it was a bad idea, except, well, the people in charge who don't want to admit they messed up.  \n\nSeriously, look at the polls! Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the whole world, people are saying it was a mistake.  Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the US troops over there, they all think we should get out. \n\nFrom the beginning, it was a disaster. And now pulling out? That's a disaster too.  The Middle East is just so complicated. It's like there's this huge gap between our way of life and theirs.  We can't just force democracy on them like it's some magic solution.  I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt. But invading a country and making it a total mess?  That's not the answer.\n\nI just don't get why we're still there. What's the point? I haven't heard any good reasons for staying. Sure, they might have some ideas, but I don't buy it.\n\nIf we're going to leave, let's just do it.  Maybe a year, maybe a little longer, but let's get out.  The Iraqi people are telling us to leave. They're the ones we're trying to help, right? Maybe they know best. \n\nAt least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" we can't be blamed if things go south. We'll be able to say, \"Hey, you asked us to leave.\"",
            "You know, I really think gender bias is still a thing in the United States.  It's not just women who face it, though. It seems to depend on what field you're in.  \n\nOverall, I feel like women have a tougher time because of this invisible barrier, this \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, a lot of people struggle with the idea of working under a woman. Society has been this way for so long, you know?  \n\nSo, women often see a job they're totally qualified for, but maybe the board won't promote them because historically, women aren't usually in leadership roles in business. \n\nThe same goes for men in certain fields, like parenting at home. It's uncommon to see a dad stay home while his wife works. People often judge that, thinking \"You're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  It can be tough on these dads when maybe they've always dreamed of being at home with their kids, and their wife is happy with her job.  \n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Sometimes, straight men aren't taken seriously there. Maybe it's because people assume fashion is \"for women.\" If a guy doesn't fit the typical \"fashion guy\" stereotype, people might question his knowledge.\n\nIt really depends on the industry.  I think gender discrimination exists in the US, but changing it is slow.  We've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is gradual. We need to keep pushing, though. Women are climbing into leadership positions, and even stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. It's happening, just slowly.\n\nMaybe we need to show the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. Not be too pushy, but highlight their strengths. If we force change, people resist. We're kind of at a good point where things are naturally shifting.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it completely legal, they just took it out of the criminal category. Now, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket. You know, you get a citation, but you don't get arrested and hauled into court.  I think if someone gets caught, it still might affect them when they're applying for jobs and stuff like that. Those consequences are usually the worst part of having a drug charge, especially for marijuana.  Lots of people worry about the future repercussions even after it's decriminalized.\n\nBut, there's an argument that it's really expensive to arrest people, hold them in jail, and process their cases.  Funding lawyers, court appearances, and prosecution all costs a lot of money.  Places with tight budgets might not want to give up that revenue even if it frees up resources. \n\nSome places are against marijuana and won't give ground on that, even if it could save money. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might make sense. Denver could use the saved money for things like education, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still kind of taboo in a lot of places, so having it out in the open could be awkward.  Plus, we don't know how it would affect driving and things like that.   Alcohol affects your motor skills more obviously, but marijuana can really mess with people's lives, not just their judgment.\n\nBoth substances have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people handle things well, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize, but they both have their downsides.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yeah, but... there are things about traditional Catholicism that both appeal and bother me.  Like, they stick to things the way they've always been done, which can be good for stability, you know? But it also feels kinda stuck in the past.  Things change, and sometimes the Church seems resistant to that.  \n\nIt feels like a lot of Catholics are expected to follow all the rules super strictly, and they can be harsh on people who don't perfectly fit the mold.  They don't seem very welcoming to folks from different faiths either.  \n\nThink of my parents – my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic church! How's that for loving thy neighbor? It's a real contradiction, you know? They preach love but then turn their backs on people who aren't exactly like them.\n\nThe teachings feel great, but the way things are actually done doesn't always match up. It's like they're stuck in the past, clinging to outdated ideas.\n\nNow, some people think allowing priests to marry would solve problems, but I'm not so sure.  It wouldn't necessarily stop anyone from doing bad things.  It's a different kind of issue altogether.  \n\nPeople who hurt kids, they're going to hurt kids, married or not. It's about them, not about their relationship status.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage... I'm still figuring it out.  I can't really say who's right or wrong, but it's definitely tough. It's like trying to balance the church and the government, you know?  And figuring out what marriage really means without upsetting anyone is a real challenge.  I think maybe we should just see all unions as civil partnerships.  Like, why does the government care what kind of ceremony people have?  If you're baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right? Same with marriage.  It's just two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in deciding what kind of marriage is valid.  Just two people, that's all that matters. \n\nAnd gay marriage... well,  it's the same thing!   Just two people wanting to be together. \n\nIf the states can all agree on something fair, they should make it a national law. But changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage is crazy!  The Constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people have strong feelings about it. It's not something that important.",
            "Hmm...my upbringing was Christian, so homosexuality is kinda tricky for me. See, I have lots of gay friends, ya know? I don't exactly agree with their lifestyle, but I think they should be allowed to marry. It shouldn't be a big national deal, though. Each state should get to decide, not the president making rules for everyone.\n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, right? So, if you live in a state that's okay with it, you gotta respect their choice, ya know? Like, you chose to live there! \n\nBasically, I think gay folks deserve the same chances as straight folks. So, legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already kinda answered this, but yeah, I don't think Bush should be able to say the whole country has to be against gay marriage. States should decide for themselves. I don't like his ban on it.\n\nIt just doesn't seem right. Bush doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to say what they can or can't do? Some things should be left up to the states, ya know? Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president wants to change things, it'll just become a back-and-forth.\n\nIt should just be up to the states because they're the ones who have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, here's the thing about Myspace. It's like, it's public, right? It's a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you put something on there, you gotta expect people to see it. Like, even if it's not under the school's name, they could still find it. Think about it, people can check Myspace at home.\n\nNow, if the school is looking at Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like a shooting, I think that's okay. Their job is to keep students safe, and if that means looking at Myspace, well, that's what they gotta do. \n\nBut here's the thing about them going on Myspace just to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels different. That's like an invasion of privacy, you know? \n\nIt's just that, if they're trying to make the school safer, and maybe even save lives, I think it's worth it. \n\nIt's a bit tricky, though.  Like, it's easier to think things through when you're writing, right?  I mean, even emails, I'm careful about what I say. You never know who might read it later.\n\nThings you post online, they stay online forever.  It's like, once it's out there, there's no taking it back.\n\nSo yeah, I think if the school's looking at Myspace to prevent something bad, it's okay. But if they're just snooping around, that's a problem.",
            "Okay, so, you know, after 9/11, I was all for getting involved. I felt it personally, and I wanted to hit them hard, just like they hit us. But looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. We didn't really think things through, and we went into it unprepared. It just backfired.\n\nHonestly, I was for it at first, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think we've accomplished anything. See, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting with us.  It's like, what's the point of us being there if they can't even get along?\n\nBecause of 9/11, I've just lost interest in what happens over there. They're a mess, always fighting, always at each other's throats. I just don't get them.\n\nThe truth is, we went in unprepared. We didn't know what to expect. And war is different there. They're brutal, savage. I don't think they're trying to better their country; they just want us out.\n\nAnd maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave. We were all hyped up, looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it. He felt like he had to do something, I get it.\n\nBut it all felt wrong. We should have had a plan, a clear strategy for what we were going to do. There was no unity, no purpose. It was just emotions and anger driving us. That's all we created over there - more anger.\n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're always going to be like that. It's been too long, and we're not making enough progress. We've made some, sure, but not enough to justify staying.  We can't stay there forever. We're just hurting ourselves."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmm, I think the Catholic Church could use a little update, you know?  People are saying it's losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things. Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that they have strong beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past. If they were a bit more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't be worried about people leaving.  I've heard folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these issues.  They just don't see eye to eye.  For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might feel uncomfortable being part of a group that says it's completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not feel welcome in a place that opposes it. Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or priests who are married.  But who knows if that would have stopped the recent scandals?  It's hard to say for sure. Maybe they would have done it anyway.  It's just weird that they expect priests to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.  It seems unfair.",
            "Mmm, okay. See, personally, I'm totally cool with gay people getting married.  I mean, whether someone is born that way or, you know, whatever, I just don't think it's something you choose, right? So, I don't think we should blame people for how they feel about who they love. It just seems wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really spent a lot of time thinking about it, but yeah, I definitely think it's wrong to say that.\n\nIt's kind of like, you know, I was born straight, and some people are born gay. It doesn't seem like a choice you make. They shouldn't have to feel bad about who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to treat them differently. Honestly, I don't think the government should get involved. It's not really a legal issue, or even a big moral issue. I don't think it's fair to put them on display like they made a mistake or something.\n\nSo, I don't think the government should have a say in it.\n\nIt's a bit tricky, you know?\n\n(laughs)  \n\nOkay, well, I just don't think the government should get involved because it's not like it affects our country's safety or anything. It's not like a moral issue. It just seems like they're overstepping.  They shouldn't be telling people how to live their lives. It's just who they are, you know? And they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "So, I think gay marriage should be totally legal, you know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are bad news for traditional families, but it's just not the same thing at all. It's like two sides of the same coin – different but connected.  Plus, there are tons of rights that come with marriage, like healthcare and property stuff. Imagine if your partner couldn't be with you in the hospital because they're not officially family. That's messed up, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same stuff that makes relationships work. They're just in love, just like everyone else. It's all about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nWhat really bugs me is the whole church and state thing. Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal marriage certificate from the government. If the government isn't getting involved in religion, then what's the big deal? \n\nIt's like saying no to civil unions but yes to marriage. That's just unfair. It's like segregation – separate but not equal.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and community stuff, but honestly, it's all about individual families, not just being gay.  Gay parents can be just as good as straight parents.  And those kids deserve the same love and support as any other kid.\n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It should be a right for everyone.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and you know, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Like, I think making it available to everyone, nah, not a good idea. But for medicine, I'm all for it.  Just 'cause it's against the law doesn't mean it can't be helpful, right?\n\nI mean, think about it, pharmacies use all kinds of drugs that are illegal, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet - those are serious stuff, but they're super useful for people.  If we can't see the good in marijuana just because it's got a bad reputation, that's not right. We gotta be open to its benefits.\n\nIt's different from alcohol, though.  Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and marijuana can too, but I think the key is to approach it slowly. Making it legal all at once might lead to problems, but if we start by getting rid of the stigma, maybe people will use it responsibly.\n\nPeople think marijuana is this terrible drug just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine. It's not that harmful. If we change how people see it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Hmm...the church, it's changed a lot since I was a little girl. It's not as strict anymore. Back then, I was always going to Sunday mass, all dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes and purses. It was every Sunday, you know, even when I went to private school. I'd see all my friends there on the weekends. \n\nBut now, things are different. They have this special mass for teenagers, just thirty minutes long, and people dress super casual. Even in the summer, some come straight from the beach! Families are always rushing in late. It's a lot more relaxed even at the morning masses.  I used to get all dressed up for those, but now people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's the church I know now. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but yeah, that's it.",
            "(laughs) \nYou know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still really shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration kept saying the war was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction – which, by the way, turned out to be completely untrue. \nThat really rubs me the wrong way. Honestly, the whole Iraq war just makes me furious. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, after giving that big presentation at the UN, has said he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious abuse of power – it's practically grounds for impeachment.  \nThey just seem to have no respect for the Constitution and have been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. They came into office with a plan to go to war, it seems like.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – who basically said that in his book after they kicked him out. It felt like Bush Jr. had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably also wanted to secure our energy supply by controlling the region. That's a pretty shady way to go about things.\n\nHonestly, it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would be messy, though. There's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and even more people would die.  \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to step in and restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It'll probably create more problems down the road because it undermines Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting recently, now has a bunch of seats in Parliament.  There are all these different groups fighting for power, and it's just creating a lot of chaos.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting too graphic.",
            "Ugh, this whole thing about the war in Iraq is such a mess. To be honest, I don’t even know where to begin. It feels pointless because it wasn’t officially declared a war, you know? It just seems like a way for us to get back at them for 9/11, like they were the only ones who could have possibly done it.\n\nHonestly, I’m not really into keeping up with all the details of the war. But I get the feeling we’re just staying there to try and build a democracy that’s more like the U.S. and to get their oil.  \n\nThe problem is, it’s making everyone upset, both there and here.  It’s like, if we stay, we’ll try to force democracy on them, but that takes forever. And if we leave, they’ll be angry because they’ll feel like we messed everything up and they have to start over. \n\nIt’s so complicated. It feels like there’s no good answer. \n\nI guess maybe it’s better to stay and help them, but it’s also a waste of resources. And it’s making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation. \n\nIt’s hard because I know families who have loved ones over there, and I want them to be safe. But then there are all these Iraqi families who have lost everything because of the fighting. It’s heartbreaking.\n\nIt’s like trying to change their culture to be more like ours, but that might make things even worse. It could make them hate us more.\n\nThis whole thing is just going to drag on and on. Ugh.",
            "Okay, so, I just don't think it's right for the government to get involved in making this legal or illegal. Like, the Constitution clearly says there should be separation of church and state, right? So trying to force a law on this would go against that.  It's like picking one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it's not the government's place to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important to religious freedom in America. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, that would be totally wrong. It would be one of the few amendments that limits people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI definitely don't think the government should be involved at all.  This guy pushing for an amendment is just trying to push his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government. There's no good reason for an amendment except for his personal views. I don't see how it would hurt the economy or anything – maybe even help!",
            "Okay, so let me tell you about this whole Iraq war thing.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th attacks, but really, they weren't that connected. The government made it seem like they were, though, using everyone's anger and fear from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made there.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't really prepared for what would happen after.  They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt, or how hard it would be to rebuild. It's like what they tried to do in Vietnam - pushing out Communists and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut the US government should have known it wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and it's not always a clear victory.  Vietnam was a loss, even if some people supported us. It's hard to win when you're fighting the entire population, not a regular army.\n\nSo, I think the government made a huge mistake going into this war. Even if you decide to go to war, you need to be prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government, and now we're still there years later.  \n\nThey made it seem like it would be a quick and successful mission, but that's just not how it works. Building a new government takes time and effort, just like it did in our own country.  It's not a simple fix.\n\nIt's really tough because we've been there for so long now. How can we just abandon these people after we took away their government and way of life?  But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, it seems like this whole thing might be about oil. We're getting our oil from there, after all. It's all about money and resources. We were also told Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though we know they have weapons.  \n\nI don't think the US government is being honest with us about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure it will.",
            "Hmm... let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage. Always have been. It's something deeply personal, don't you think? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just a choice. It wouldn't be fair to take away someone's rights just because they're born a certain way, right? That seems kind of cruel.\n\nI've always been on the side of equality for everyone. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's about love and commitment, things that happen at home, in families.\n\nLike, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples. They're not married, of course, because the law doesn't allow it. But they live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, going about their day. Why should it matter?\n\nIt's like Bush trying to play God and decide what marriage means. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nYou know, I've read a lot about how there might be a chemical difference in the brains of gay people. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose. Like, maybe having lots of sisters and no brothers doesn't make you gay, right?\n\nExcept for the obvious reasons, it's kind of unfair. If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas and no one would even know. But if two gay people want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It's like it should be a private matter, not something everyone else needs to know about. It's their relationship, not the government's business.",

It's the same online.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's for everyone.\n\nSchools have to act when they hear something concerning, even if it's just a rumor. They can't just ignore it and hope for the best.  What if something bad happens? They'd regret not taking action.  \n\nOf course, not everything online is serious. Sometimes people joke around, but it's tricky to tell the difference.  It's like that time we had at school where a harmless experiment went wrong and everyone panicked.  But sometimes, those online posts can be really serious, too. \n\nThere was this one case where someone overheard a conversation at school, and they reported it.  When they looked at the person's Facebook, they found some things that seemed harmless at first but became really worrying given the situation.\n\nSo, basically, once you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see.  Think before you post!  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online.  You can't control how people interpret it, but you can control what you share.",
            "This war feels like it's dragged on way too long. I get that the starting point had good intentions – helping another country get democracy. But I feel like we've forgotten that original goal. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove how powerful we are.  Plus, I think there were some questionable reasons for starting the war in the first place, like maybe old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  \n\nIf the goal was truly to give democracy to a country without fair politics, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, it wouldn't be fair.  \n\nI think we made our point in the early days of the war. That was a statement in itself. But the fact that it's been going on for years now just seems excessive.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that's a noble reason to fight. But I think our purpose has become muddled over time. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to win a decisive victory.\n\nThis war has lasted long enough. It's time for their government and people to take charge. We've been spending billions of dollars, draining our own economy, when we have problems here at home like poverty and crumbling infrastructure that need attention. That money could be better spent on improving our own lives.\n\nWe can't be in a constant state of war. There are so many other important things we need to focus on, like education, healthcare, and fixing our roads. It's heartbreaking to see money being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost sight of.",
            "Let me ask something, can you explain how this was stopped?  Someone looked online and saw something, right? Okay, I don't think that's bad. On sites like Myspace, if you put something online, anyone can see it.  I know on Myspace you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you've chosen to be friends with them, so they can see it. So, whenever you put things online, you have to understand that lots of people will see it. If someone saw something and could stop something bad from happening, I think that’s good.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day.  It would feel discriminatory to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job to just look at people's profiles. I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. It makes me uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a news story about a man who showed how easy it is to find information about people online. He found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet him. I wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they know my interests, what I look like, when I'm in class, and who my friends are. They can see lots of photos. I try to limit what I share, but it's hard because Facebook is for connecting with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who is looking at your profile.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace, and I thought that was strange. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I don't know if it's really a privacy issue, but I don't know how they have the right to tell people what they can and can't do. That's all I can think of.",
            "Hmm, you know... This whole Iraq War thing, it's a tough one for me. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, like everyone else who's suddenly against it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not like my opinion really matters now.  It's just... everyone knows it was a bad idea, except, well, the people in charge who don't want to admit they messed up.  \n\nSeriously, look at the polls! Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the whole world, people are saying it was a mistake.  Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the US troops over there, they all think we should get out. \n\nFrom the beginning, it was a disaster. And now pulling out? That's a disaster too.  The Middle East is just so complicated. It's like there's this huge gap between our way of life and theirs.  We can't just force democracy on them like it's some magic solution.  I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt. But invading a country and making it a total mess?  That's not the answer.\n\nI just don't get why we're still there. What's the point? I haven't heard any good reasons for staying. Sure, they might have some ideas, but I don't buy it.\n\nIf we're going to leave, let's just do it.  Maybe a year, maybe a little longer, but let's get out.  The Iraqi people are telling us to leave. They're the ones we're trying to help, right? Maybe they know best. \n\nAt least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" we can't be blamed if things go south. We'll be able to say, \"Hey, you asked us to leave.\"",
            "You know, I really think gender bias is still a thing in the United States.  It's not just women who face it, though. It seems to depend on what field you're in.  \n\nOverall, I feel like women have a tougher time because of this invisible barrier, this \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, a lot of people struggle with the idea of working under a woman. Society has been this way for so long, you know?  \n\nSo, women often see a job they're totally qualified for, but maybe the board won't promote them because historically, women aren't usually in leadership roles in business. \n\nThe same goes for men in certain fields, like parenting at home. It's uncommon to see a dad stay home while his wife works. People often judge that, thinking \"You're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  It can be tough on these dads when maybe they've always dreamed of being at home with their kids, and their wife is happy with her job.  \n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Sometimes, straight men aren't taken seriously there. Maybe it's because people assume fashion is \"for women.\" If a guy doesn't fit the typical \"fashion guy\" stereotype, people might question his knowledge.\n\nIt really depends on the industry.  I think gender discrimination exists in the US, but changing it is slow.  We've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is gradual. We need to keep pushing, though. Women are climbing into leadership positions, and even stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. It's happening, just slowly.\n\nMaybe we need to show the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. Not be too pushy, but highlight their strengths. If we force change, people resist. We're kind of at a good point where things are naturally shifting.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it completely legal, they just took it out of the criminal category. Now, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket. You know, you get a citation, but you don't get arrested and hauled into court.  I think if someone gets caught, it still might affect them when they're applying for jobs and stuff like that. Those consequences are usually the worst part of having a drug charge, especially for marijuana.  Lots of people worry about the future repercussions even after it's decriminalized.\n\nBut, there's an argument that it's really expensive to arrest people, hold them in jail, and process their cases.  Funding lawyers, court appearances, and prosecution all costs a lot of money.  Places with tight budgets might not want to give up that revenue even if it frees up resources. \n\nSome places are against marijuana and won't give ground on that, even if it could save money. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might make sense. Denver could use the saved money for things like education, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still kind of taboo in a lot of places, so having it out in the open could be awkward.  Plus, we don't know how it would affect driving and things like that.   Alcohol affects your motor skills more obviously, but marijuana can really mess with people's lives, not just their judgment.\n\nBoth substances have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people handle things well, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize, but they both have their downsides.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yeah, but... there are things about traditional Catholicism that both appeal and bother me.  Like, they stick to things the way they've always been done, which can be good for stability, you know? But it also feels kinda stuck in the past.  Things change, and sometimes the Church seems resistant to that.  \n\nIt feels like a lot of Catholics are expected to follow all the rules super strictly, and they can be harsh on people who don't perfectly fit the mold.  They don't seem very welcoming to folks from different faiths either.  \n\nThink of my parents – my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic church! How's that for loving thy neighbor? It's a real contradiction, you know? They preach love but then turn their backs on people who aren't exactly like them.\n\nThe teachings feel great, but the way things are actually done doesn't always match up. It's like they're stuck in the past, clinging to outdated ideas.\n\nNow, some people think allowing priests to marry would solve problems, but I'm not so sure.  It wouldn't necessarily stop anyone from doing bad things.  It's a different kind of issue altogether.  \n\nPeople who hurt kids, they're going to hurt kids, married or not. It's about them, not about their relationship status.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage... I'm still figuring it out.  I can't really say who's right or wrong, but it's definitely tough. It's like trying to balance the church and the government, you know?  And figuring out what marriage really means without upsetting anyone is a real challenge.  I think maybe we should just see all unions as civil partnerships.  Like, why does the government care what kind of ceremony people have?  If you're baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right? Same with marriage.  It's just two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in deciding what kind of marriage is valid.  Just two people, that's all that matters. \n\nAnd gay marriage... well,  it's the same thing!   Just two people wanting to be together. \n\nIf the states can all agree on something fair, they should make it a national law. But changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage is crazy!  The Constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people have strong feelings about it. It's not something that important.",
            "Hmm...my upbringing was Christian, so homosexuality is kinda tricky for me. See, I have lots of gay friends, ya know? I don't exactly agree with their lifestyle, but I think they should be allowed to marry. It shouldn't be a big national deal, though. Each state should get to decide, not the president making rules for everyone.\n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, right? So, if you live in a state that's okay with it, you gotta respect their choice, ya know? Like, you chose to live there! \n\nBasically, I think gay folks deserve the same chances as straight folks. So, legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already kinda answered this, but yeah, I don't think Bush should be able to say the whole country has to be against gay marriage. States should decide for themselves. I don't like his ban on it.\n\nIt just doesn't seem right. Bush doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to say what they can or can't do? Some things should be left up to the states, ya know? Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president wants to change things, it'll just become a back-and-forth.\n\nIt should just be up to the states because they're the ones who have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, here's the thing about Myspace. It's like, it's public, right? It's a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you put something on there, you gotta expect people to see it. Like, even if it's not under the school's name, they could still find it. Think about it, people can check Myspace at home.\n\nNow, if the school is looking at Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like a shooting, I think that's okay. Their job is to keep students safe, and if that means looking at Myspace, well, that's what they gotta do. \n\nBut here's the thing about them going on Myspace just to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels different. That's like an invasion of privacy, you know? \n\nIt's just that, if they're trying to make the school safer, and maybe even save lives, I think it's worth it. \n\nIt's a bit tricky, though.  Like, it's easier to think things through when you're writing, right?  I mean, even emails, I'm careful about what I say. You never know who might read it later.\n\nThings you post online, they stay online forever.  It's like, once it's out there, there's no taking it back.\n\nSo yeah, I think if the school's looking at Myspace to prevent something bad, it's okay. But if they're just snooping around, that's a problem.",
            "Okay, so, you know, after 9/11, I was all for getting involved. I felt it personally, and I wanted to hit them hard, just like they hit us. But looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. We didn't really think things through, and we went into it unprepared. It just backfired.\n\nHonestly, I was for it at first, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think we've accomplished anything. See, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting with us.  It's like, what's the point of us being there if they can't even get along?\n\nBecause of 9/11, I've just lost interest in what happens over there. They're a mess, always fighting, always at each other's throats. I just don't get them.\n\nThe truth is, we went in unprepared. We didn't know what to expect. And war is different there. They're brutal, savage. I don't think they're trying to better their country; they just want us out.\n\nAnd maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave. We were all hyped up, looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it. He felt like he had to do something, I get it.\n\nBut it all felt wrong. We should have had a plan, a clear strategy for what we were going to do. There was no unity, no purpose. It was just emotions and anger driving us. That's all we created over there - more anger.\n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're always going to be like that. It's been too long, and we're not making enough progress. We've made some, sure, but not enough to justify staying.  We can't stay there forever. We're just hurting ourselves."
