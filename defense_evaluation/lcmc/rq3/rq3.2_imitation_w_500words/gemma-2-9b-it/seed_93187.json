            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church needs to update some of its ideas.  \n\nA lot of people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very open-minded about things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but they seem a bit stuck in the past.\n\nIf they were more open to modern thinking, I think they wouldn't worry so much about losing people. I've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with its stance on these topics. They feel like the Church is wrong about these things.\n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a place where it's seen as completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage - if you support that, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the scandals we've seen. It's hard to say for sure if things would be different.\n\n\nIt just seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.",
            "Ehm...you know, I'm okay with gay marriage.  I don't think it's something you choose, like it's just how you are, ya know?  I don't think we should blame people for being gay. So, it feels wrong to say that a man and woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. It just doesn't seem fair.\n\nHonestly, I haven't thought about this too much, but I feel like it's wrong to say that. It's not like someone decides to be gay, right?  Just like I was born straight, someone else might be born gay.  It's not a choice.\n\n(clears throat) Yeah, I think it's wrong to stop people from getting married just because they're the same gender.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved, because it's not really a legal issue or something they should decide. It's more of a personal thing.  I don't want it to feel like we're putting gay people on display or making them feel like they made a mistake.\n\nSo I don't think the government should have anything to say about it. It's just not their place.\n\nIt's kind of complicated, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI guess I don't think the government should be involved because it doesn't affect national security or anything like that. It's not a moral issue. It's just about people's lives and who they love.\n\nIt just feels wrong to me to tell people they can't marry because of who they are. It's like how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "Okay, here's the thing about gay marriage.  There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some folks think that same-sex couples are a threat to families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're different but both are fruit.  It comes down to basic rights, like health care and property.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick. It's messed up if you're committed to someone and they can't be there for you when you need them. Studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not anything else.  \n\nWhat really bothers me is that people get hung up on the religious angle. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they just want a legal marriage certificate. Keep religion and government separate, right? It's like saying someone can't get married because their religion doesn't approve - that's not fair.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but there's no proof that kids raised by gay parents are any different.  It's about good parenting, not who the parents are. In some places, kids from gay families get bullied just for being different. That's wrong.\n\nWe need the government to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and treating everyone fairly. [",
            "Okay, so here's the thing about working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer.  Just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful.  I mean, I get it, making it freely available to everyone? Big no-no. But for medical reasons? Definitely yes.  I mean,  illegal doesn't equal no good, right?  \n\nThink about it, pharmacies use all sorts of controlled substances like Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet -  things that are totally illegal for regular folks. But doctors use them all the time because they can help people.  It's just that there's this crazy stigma around marijuana. We shouldn't judge something just because it's illegal. \n\nAlcohol is a good example, too.  It's legal but can be awful if you abuse it.  Marijuana can be abused too, but it's not as bad.  Maybe we should start slow with marijuana, make it legal gradually.  First, we need to ditch the bad image we have of it.  If we can get people to see it as something that can be used responsibly, then things might change. \n\nPeople think marijuana is super dangerous just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop thinking of it as this horrible drug, people might be more willing to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "So, yeah, I think the church has definitely changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be, you know? When I was a kid, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too. But now that I'm older, they have this teenager mass, and it's only thirty minutes long! People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see people coming straight from the beach in their swimsuits, families rushing in late, the whole deal. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed overall. \n\nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed about the changes. As for other stuff, I don't really know much about the inner workings of the church, but that's the church I know.\n\n\nRegarding all those accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests get married would have stopped it.  After all, there are married men who still become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not, it's about the person.  It's their choice to become a priest, and some religions allow priests to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  If they really want to marry and practice their faith, maybe they should consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia might be based on genetics,  something you're born with. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually, even if they try to hide it.  I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\nSo, you see, at first I was okay with the whole situation, but everyone was still pretty shaken up after 9/11. I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration, they linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We know now that none of that was true. It really bothers me that they led people astray like that.  Honestly, the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it yet.  Even Colin Powell, after his big speech at the UN, admitted he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then!  That's just wrong, plain and simple. To me, that's a serious offense. They don't seem to care about the Constitution at all, not since 9/11 anyway.  It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nI read in this book by a former Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – that the younger Bush was basically out for revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration. Plus, he probably wanted to control more of the world's energy supply.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nIt's been going on for far too long. Pulling out right now would be messy, though.  The country could easily fall into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nSo, the UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia involved to help fix things. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could lead to even more problems down the road because Iraq's sovereignty would become a huge issue.  The current government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.  The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, has a bunch of seats in Parliament now.  There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of trouble.\n\n(laughs)\n\nI could go on, but it's probably best not to say it all out loud.",
            "Mmm hmm. Let me just talk about my thoughts on the war in Iraq. Honestly, I feel like it’s kind of pointless. It wasn't even officially declared a war, you know? It feels like it was just a way for us to retaliate against Iraq because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks.  \n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're still there trying to establish a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. ally, and maybe also to secure their oil. But staying there just keeps causing more problems and making people upset. \n\nPlus, building a democracy takes a long time. It's not something you can just force overnight. If we leave suddenly, they'll be angry because they'll feel like we messed everything up and left them to deal with the mess. It's a real dilemma.\n\nHonestly, this topic is really hard for me. I don't know that much about it. I guess I feel torn. On one hand, I want the war to end because it's causing so much suffering. There are so many families with loved ones in Iraq, and I worry about them.  \n\nBut on the other hand, I don't want to leave Iraq in a worse state. It seems like our involvement has already caused a lot of chaos, and trying to force our way of life on them could make things even worse. I worry that it will just fuel more resentment and violence.\n\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really sad.",
            "Hmm... this whole issue about making it legal, it just feels wrong, you know? Like, it shouldn't be up to the government to decide. Our constitution, it clearly says separation of church and state.  It's written right there. Trying to force this on everyone, it feels like going against what's already been decided.  Plus, it seems like people pushing to make it illegal are just favoring one church's beliefs over others.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians aren't on board with it, except maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important, it's what makes religious freedom possible in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It would go against what's already in the constitution and would probably be the only amendment that restricts people instead of the government. \n\nHonestly, I don't think the federal government should have anything to do with this.  I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're trying to push their religion over everyone else's.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government.  There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't even impact the economy or anything like that.  It might even help society in some ways.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq... I don't really believe the government was completely honest with the people about why we went to war. They tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really related. The government used the fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one without a good reason.  This war feels a lot like Vietnam – we made the same mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The US just kicked out Iraq's government without a plan for what would happen next, which created chaos. \n\nThey wanted to put in a democracy, just like in Vietnam, but it's a really difficult and long process. It wasn't a clear victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss because there are always going to be people who resist, even if they want change. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there, and it's almost 2007, yet we're still losing soldiers. We're trying to train Iraqi troops, but it's taking forever. The US government didn't seem to understand how long and hard it takes to establish a new government. \n\nIt's complicated. We went in there, and now it's hard to just leave. We took away their government and way of life, so what do we do now? It's a tough choice. We risk more American lives for a democratic Iraq, but how many is too many? \n\nWhy are we focusing on Iraq and not other countries that need this kind of change? I think it might be about the oil.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. North Korea has those weapons, but we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not sure that will happen.",
            "Hmm...let me see... I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I truly believe it's a personal choice, you know? And studies show it's more about biology than anything else.  It's not fair to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong, you know? \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something between two people.  Like in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because the law won't let them. But they live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and doing normal things. \n\nIt's crazy how some people, like Bush, try to play God and decide what marriage means.  I think it's ridiculous. \n\nThere's tons of research showing that being gay is a biological thing, something you're born with. It's not a choice.\n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married they can just elope to Vegas and do it secretly. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a big public scandal. It shouldn't be a big deal, you know? It should be a private matter, not something the government gets involved in.",

What you post online can shape how people view you. If you're talking about violent things, someone might get worried. You can't just put anything out there.\n\nThe internet is huge, anyone can see it. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. So, if someone sees something concerning online, they might tell the school. They can't ignore it, because if something bad happens, they might have been able to stop it.\n\nIt's tricky though, because sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's serious. It could be a harmless experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. In one case, someone overheard something in school and told the school. They looked at the student's Facebook and found some posts that seemed harmless, but in light of the situation, they were worrisome.\n\nBasically, once you put something online, it's out there. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared it publicly. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger.",
            "This war feels like it's been going on forever.  In the beginning, I understood the goal – to bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove something to the world.  \n\nI even wonder if the reasons for starting the war were a bit shaky to begin with. There were those old issues between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein, and I can't help but think they played a part.\n\nIf the goal truly was to help people gain a fair political system, that would be a good reason for war. But if there were personal vendettas involved, then it wouldn't be right.\n\nAnyway, the war dragged on for way too long.  We made our point in the first few months, but now it just feels endless.\n\nI mean, if our goal was to free people from a tyrannical leader, that's a worthy cause. But over time, I think our reasons have gotten muddled. It feels like we're just stuck in a cycle of fighting, needing to declare victory, even if we've lost sight of what we're fighting for. \n\nThis war needs to end.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, money that could be used to help our own people. We have so many problems here at home – poverty, education, healthcare – that deserve our attention.\n\nIt's just not right to keep spending so much money on a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "Let me ask, though, isn't it kind of okay that someone found that information online?  Like, wasn't it good that someone saw it and was able to stop something bad from happening?\n\nI mean, it's tricky, right? You can't have someone watching every single student's profile all the time. It would be unfair to pick on certain kids and snoop on them just because they might be up to something.  \n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for specific things? \n\nIt's similar to how I feel about my own social media. I have Facebook, and it's scary to think about how much information is out there and how people can find it. I've heard stories about creeps who can easily get your information and even get you to meet up with them. It makes me nervous because they can learn a lot about you from your profile – your interests, your friends, even your schedule.\n\nI try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I also want to connect with my friends.\n\nIt's a tough balance. It's weird to think about schools banning Myspace, though. How can they really control what their students do online?  It feels like an invasion of privacy, even if they think they're trying to protect us.",
            "Hmm... Okay, so there's this thing about the Iraq War that I kinda feel weird talking about. I hate to sound like everyone else who's all, \"I knew it was a bad idea from the start!\"  But, honestly, it's just...  It feels like everyone agrees it was a mess except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong. You see it everywhere.  Poll after poll, people from the US, Iraq, even around the world, say it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think we should have never gone there. Even a lot of our own soldiers feel that way!\n\nIt's been a total disaster from the beginning.  And getting out is going to be another disaster. Honestly, it feels like anything we do in the Middle East just turns into a nightmare.\n\nIt's like we don't get it.  The US and the Middle East, we're just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. It's not how things work there.\n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about all the consequences is just reckless. It's like falling into quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some fancy reasons for staying, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually, maybe over a year, I wouldn't mind. But leaving now would be the best.\n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and some even want us to leave right now. Those are the people we're trying to help!  Maybe they know what's best for them. If we ask them and they say leave, at least we can say we tried to do what they wanted.\n\nMaybe then, if things go bad, we can step in and actually be the good guys.  I mean, we're never going to be totally loved in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Um, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  It's not just about women though. It seems to depend on what kind of work you do.  I mean, overall, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  Lots of guys struggle with the idea of working under a woman because of how society has always been. So, women often see jobs they're totally qualified for, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those top business roles.  And, it's kind of the same for men too. Like, in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's not really common to see a man doing those things. People often judge them for it, thinking a man should be working and making money for the family. It can be really hard on them, especially if it's always been their dream to stay home with the kids and help out, even if the wife has the better job.  It just works for them, but society doesn't get it.  And in fashion, sometimes people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because guys who are into fashion are often seen as having different lifestyles.  So if a guy has a typical lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might think, \"How can you really know about fashion if you're not a woman?\"  It's like they don't think he understands women's fashion.  \n\nSo, depending on the field, I definitely feel like there's gender discrimination in the US. Changing things is tough because society has these set ideas, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change is slow. I think we're making progress though. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are staying home with the kids and it's becoming more okay.  People are starting to see that it doesn't always have to be a certain way. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their female friends and wives and realizing that guys can know about fashion too. You kind of have to promote these different types of people by showing the good qualities without pushing too hard. If you force it, people resist. \n\nI think we're in a good place where things are starting to change naturally. I don't know if there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time.   \n\nOh, and by the way, it's not just about gender. People can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their education too. Like, if someone grew up on a farm and their grammar isn't perfect, but they're super smart and work their way up to a CEO position, other guys might look down on them and think they aren't serious because of their grammar. It's like, who knows what they're really saying if they can't speak properly. So yeah, there's discrimination based on a lot of things.",
            "So, basically, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the books as a criminal offense. You know, like a parking ticket instead of jail time.  My understanding is that if you get caught, it's still gonna mess with your job applications and stuff, even if it's not as bad as a full-blown arrest. The thing is, even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about those future consequences. But, on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest and process people for marijuana.  It costs a lot to keep them in jail, take them to court, and everything else.   So, for places that are struggling financially, it makes sense that they wouldn't want to decriminalize it, even if it would save them money. Some places just don't want to do it, even if they know it would be good for their budget. But, places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's totally fine. I bet they're using the money they saved to help people in need.  \n\nIt's important because we don't want weed everywhere, you know? There are other reasons why it shouldn't be super easy to get. But the money stuff is a big deal too.\n\nWhat if it got completely legal? Like cigarettes? Then everyone would be smoking it everywhere, and we'd have people driving high. And even now, it's still kind of taboo in a lot of places. It would just feel weird to have it so open.  \n\n\nI think alcohol messes with your motor skills worse, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. But they both have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it better than others. It's hard to say what's worse because it depends on the person.",
            "Hmmm...this whole Catholic thing, it's a mixed bag, you know?\n\nOn one hand, I get why people like them. They've got these strong traditions, things they've been doing for ages. Feels kinda comforting, like you've got roots. But hanging on too tight can be a problem too, gotta be able to bend with the times. \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know, they take it seriously, like going to church every week is a must. And the rules?  They're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like they think only *perfect* Catholics belong, and they're not so welcoming to folks who aren't exactly on the same page, or even from different religions.\n\nTake my parents, for example.  My mom was Catholic, my dad was Episcopalian, and the church wouldn't marry them!  Saying you love everyone but then not accepting them? Kinda hypocritical, right? It's like they preach love but then act closed off.\n\nThe church tells you to do good things, but sometimes their way of doing things just feels stuck in the past.  \n\nNow, some folks say letting priests marry would be a good idea, but honestly, I don't think it would stop the bad stuff. It's a separate issue, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they'll probably do it no matter what.  Being married doesn't change that.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage is really tough. I can't say one side is right or wrong, but it's definitely the hardest issue we're facing right now. It's like a balancing act between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.  It's super tricky, you know?  Like, should the government get involved in defining marriage at all? If it's a religious thing, shouldn't it be up to the churches?  Take baptism, for example, no one gets special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union, like two people coming together. The government shouldn't care what kind of marriage it is, just that two people are united.  And speaking of different types of marriage, this whole gay marriage thing... it's just two people wanting to be together, right?  If everyone can agree on a solution, shouldn't it become a national law?  But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's crazy! It feels like such a big deal to some people, but it doesn't seem like a good reason to change the constitution.",
            "Hmm...growing up in a Christian home, things like homosexuality are kinda confusing for me.  I've got plenty of gay friends, you see? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a big national debate, though.  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to legalize gay marriage. You know, like some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  If you live in a state that's okay with gay marriage, well,  that's just how it is there. You kinda chose to live there, right?  I think everyone deserves the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight. So, let each state make its own call. \n\nI already kinda said it, but it just feels wrong for someone like Bush, who doesn't live in every state, to ban gay marriage for the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide. I just don't think he should have that much power. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in who wants to lift the ban, it'll just be back and forth. It's better to let each state figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the decision.",
            "Okay, so let me get this straight. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? If you put something on there, anyone can see it, not just your friends.  Even if school officials aren't looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home. \n\nThink about it, if they're looking at Myspace to keep kids safe, like stopping a school shooting, that seems okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect students, right?  \n\nBut, if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy.  It's different when they're trying to prevent something bad from happening. \n\nIt's easier to express yourself in writing, so I guess I could say more about that. Since Myspace is public, if you post something and don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of silly. Everything you do online can come back to bite you later.\n\nLike, what you do in college could come back to haunt you when you're older. Once something is online, it's out there forever. \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy to look at Myspace if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen.  It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they want to know it's a safe place.\n\nMy teacher told me that schools have to do things like lock downs and drills to keep everyone safe. They want to be prepared for anything, like a school shooting.",
            "Okay, so, about this war...At first, I was all for it. Nine Eleven really hit me hard—it felt personal. I wanted to fight back, to dish out the same kind of trouble they caused us. Looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. It felt like we rushed into things without a real plan, and it just backfired. \n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It seems like those people are too busy fighting each other to bother with us. What's the point of us being there if they can't even get along? Honestly,  because of Nine Eleven, I don't really care what happens over there anymore. I just feel like they're all so different from us. They fight and fight, but they can't seem to solve anything on their own.\n\nWe went in unprepared. We didn't know what we were walking into, and war over there is unlike anything we've ever seen. They're just brutal, and I don't think they care about improving their country. They just want us out. I think that's fine with me—we should just leave.\n\nHonestly, I think we were all hyped up and angry, more than anything. We weren't thinking clearly about the consequences or how they'd react to us trying to change their whole way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge, and President Bush went along with it because the people wanted it.\n\nI get it, though. After Nine Eleven, we couldn't just ignore what happened. We had to do something. But maybe we could have done it differently.  We should have had a better plan, been clearer about our goals, and worked together better. There was no unity, no clear direction. \n\nI just think we went in with too much emotion and anger, and that's what we created there.  \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to change them. Maybe they'll always be like this. I don't know. I've said enough."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church needs to update some of its ideas.  \n\nA lot of people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very open-minded about things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but they seem a bit stuck in the past.\n\nIf they were more open to modern thinking, I think they wouldn't worry so much about losing people. I've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with its stance on these topics. They feel like the Church is wrong about these things.\n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a place where it's seen as completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage - if you support that, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the scandals we've seen. It's hard to say for sure if things would be different.\n\n\nIt just seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.",
            "Ehm...you know, I'm okay with gay marriage.  I don't think it's something you choose, like it's just how you are, ya know?  I don't think we should blame people for being gay. So, it feels wrong to say that a man and woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. It just doesn't seem fair.\n\nHonestly, I haven't thought about this too much, but I feel like it's wrong to say that. It's not like someone decides to be gay, right?  Just like I was born straight, someone else might be born gay.  It's not a choice.\n\n(clears throat) Yeah, I think it's wrong to stop people from getting married just because they're the same gender.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved, because it's not really a legal issue or something they should decide. It's more of a personal thing.  I don't want it to feel like we're putting gay people on display or making them feel like they made a mistake.\n\nSo I don't think the government should have anything to say about it. It's just not their place.\n\nIt's kind of complicated, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI guess I don't think the government should be involved because it doesn't affect national security or anything like that. It's not a moral issue. It's just about people's lives and who they love.\n\nIt just feels wrong to me to tell people they can't marry because of who they are. It's like how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "Okay, here's the thing about gay marriage.  There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some folks think that same-sex couples are a threat to families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're different but both are fruit.  It comes down to basic rights, like health care and property.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick. It's messed up if you're committed to someone and they can't be there for you when you need them. Studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not anything else.  \n\nWhat really bothers me is that people get hung up on the religious angle. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they just want a legal marriage certificate. Keep religion and government separate, right? It's like saying someone can't get married because their religion doesn't approve - that's not fair.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but there's no proof that kids raised by gay parents are any different.  It's about good parenting, not who the parents are. In some places, kids from gay families get bullied just for being different. That's wrong.\n\nWe need the government to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and treating everyone fairly. [",
            "Okay, so here's the thing about working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer.  Just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful.  I mean, I get it, making it freely available to everyone? Big no-no. But for medical reasons? Definitely yes.  I mean,  illegal doesn't equal no good, right?  \n\nThink about it, pharmacies use all sorts of controlled substances like Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet -  things that are totally illegal for regular folks. But doctors use them all the time because they can help people.  It's just that there's this crazy stigma around marijuana. We shouldn't judge something just because it's illegal. \n\nAlcohol is a good example, too.  It's legal but can be awful if you abuse it.  Marijuana can be abused too, but it's not as bad.  Maybe we should start slow with marijuana, make it legal gradually.  First, we need to ditch the bad image we have of it.  If we can get people to see it as something that can be used responsibly, then things might change. \n\nPeople think marijuana is super dangerous just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop thinking of it as this horrible drug, people might be more willing to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "So, yeah, I think the church has definitely changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be, you know? When I was a kid, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too. But now that I'm older, they have this teenager mass, and it's only thirty minutes long! People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see people coming straight from the beach in their swimsuits, families rushing in late, the whole deal. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed overall. \n\nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed about the changes. As for other stuff, I don't really know much about the inner workings of the church, but that's the church I know.\n\n\nRegarding all those accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests get married would have stopped it.  After all, there are married men who still become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not, it's about the person.  It's their choice to become a priest, and some religions allow priests to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  If they really want to marry and practice their faith, maybe they should consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia might be based on genetics,  something you're born with. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually, even if they try to hide it.  I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\nSo, you see, at first I was okay with the whole situation, but everyone was still pretty shaken up after 9/11. I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration, they linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We know now that none of that was true. It really bothers me that they led people astray like that.  Honestly, the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it yet.  Even Colin Powell, after his big speech at the UN, admitted he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then!  That's just wrong, plain and simple. To me, that's a serious offense. They don't seem to care about the Constitution at all, not since 9/11 anyway.  It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nI read in this book by a former Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – that the younger Bush was basically out for revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration. Plus, he probably wanted to control more of the world's energy supply.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nIt's been going on for far too long. Pulling out right now would be messy, though.  The country could easily fall into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nSo, the UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia involved to help fix things. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could lead to even more problems down the road because Iraq's sovereignty would become a huge issue.  The current government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.  The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, has a bunch of seats in Parliament now.  There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of trouble.\n\n(laughs)\n\nI could go on, but it's probably best not to say it all out loud.",
            "Mmm hmm. Let me just talk about my thoughts on the war in Iraq. Honestly, I feel like it’s kind of pointless. It wasn't even officially declared a war, you know? It feels like it was just a way for us to retaliate against Iraq because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks.  \n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're still there trying to establish a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. ally, and maybe also to secure their oil. But staying there just keeps causing more problems and making people upset. \n\nPlus, building a democracy takes a long time. It's not something you can just force overnight. If we leave suddenly, they'll be angry because they'll feel like we messed everything up and left them to deal with the mess. It's a real dilemma.\n\nHonestly, this topic is really hard for me. I don't know that much about it. I guess I feel torn. On one hand, I want the war to end because it's causing so much suffering. There are so many families with loved ones in Iraq, and I worry about them.  \n\nBut on the other hand, I don't want to leave Iraq in a worse state. It seems like our involvement has already caused a lot of chaos, and trying to force our way of life on them could make things even worse. I worry that it will just fuel more resentment and violence.\n\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really sad.",
            "Hmm... this whole issue about making it legal, it just feels wrong, you know? Like, it shouldn't be up to the government to decide. Our constitution, it clearly says separation of church and state.  It's written right there. Trying to force this on everyone, it feels like going against what's already been decided.  Plus, it seems like people pushing to make it illegal are just favoring one church's beliefs over others.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians aren't on board with it, except maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important, it's what makes religious freedom possible in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It would go against what's already in the constitution and would probably be the only amendment that restricts people instead of the government. \n\nHonestly, I don't think the federal government should have anything to do with this.  I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're trying to push their religion over everyone else's.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government.  There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't even impact the economy or anything like that.  It might even help society in some ways.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq... I don't really believe the government was completely honest with the people about why we went to war. They tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really related. The government used the fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one without a good reason.  This war feels a lot like Vietnam – we made the same mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The US just kicked out Iraq's government without a plan for what would happen next, which created chaos. \n\nThey wanted to put in a democracy, just like in Vietnam, but it's a really difficult and long process. It wasn't a clear victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss because there are always going to be people who resist, even if they want change. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there, and it's almost 2007, yet we're still losing soldiers. We're trying to train Iraqi troops, but it's taking forever. The US government didn't seem to understand how long and hard it takes to establish a new government. \n\nIt's complicated. We went in there, and now it's hard to just leave. We took away their government and way of life, so what do we do now? It's a tough choice. We risk more American lives for a democratic Iraq, but how many is too many? \n\nWhy are we focusing on Iraq and not other countries that need this kind of change? I think it might be about the oil.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. North Korea has those weapons, but we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not sure that will happen.",
            "Hmm...let me see... I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I truly believe it's a personal choice, you know? And studies show it's more about biology than anything else.  It's not fair to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong, you know? \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something between two people.  Like in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because the law won't let them. But they live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and doing normal things. \n\nIt's crazy how some people, like Bush, try to play God and decide what marriage means.  I think it's ridiculous. \n\nThere's tons of research showing that being gay is a biological thing, something you're born with. It's not a choice.\n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married they can just elope to Vegas and do it secretly. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a big public scandal. It shouldn't be a big deal, you know? It should be a private matter, not something the government gets involved in.",

What you post online can shape how people view you. If you're talking about violent things, someone might get worried. You can't just put anything out there.\n\nThe internet is huge, anyone can see it. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. So, if someone sees something concerning online, they might tell the school. They can't ignore it, because if something bad happens, they might have been able to stop it.\n\nIt's tricky though, because sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's serious. It could be a harmless experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. In one case, someone overheard something in school and told the school. They looked at the student's Facebook and found some posts that seemed harmless, but in light of the situation, they were worrisome.\n\nBasically, once you put something online, it's out there. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared it publicly. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger.",
            "This war feels like it's been going on forever.  In the beginning, I understood the goal – to bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove something to the world.  \n\nI even wonder if the reasons for starting the war were a bit shaky to begin with. There were those old issues between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein, and I can't help but think they played a part.\n\nIf the goal truly was to help people gain a fair political system, that would be a good reason for war. But if there were personal vendettas involved, then it wouldn't be right.\n\nAnyway, the war dragged on for way too long.  We made our point in the first few months, but now it just feels endless.\n\nI mean, if our goal was to free people from a tyrannical leader, that's a worthy cause. But over time, I think our reasons have gotten muddled. It feels like we're just stuck in a cycle of fighting, needing to declare victory, even if we've lost sight of what we're fighting for. \n\nThis war needs to end.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, money that could be used to help our own people. We have so many problems here at home – poverty, education, healthcare – that deserve our attention.\n\nIt's just not right to keep spending so much money on a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "Let me ask, though, isn't it kind of okay that someone found that information online?  Like, wasn't it good that someone saw it and was able to stop something bad from happening?\n\nI mean, it's tricky, right? You can't have someone watching every single student's profile all the time. It would be unfair to pick on certain kids and snoop on them just because they might be up to something.  \n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for specific things? \n\nIt's similar to how I feel about my own social media. I have Facebook, and it's scary to think about how much information is out there and how people can find it. I've heard stories about creeps who can easily get your information and even get you to meet up with them. It makes me nervous because they can learn a lot about you from your profile – your interests, your friends, even your schedule.\n\nI try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I also want to connect with my friends.\n\nIt's a tough balance. It's weird to think about schools banning Myspace, though. How can they really control what their students do online?  It feels like an invasion of privacy, even if they think they're trying to protect us.",
            "Hmm... Okay, so there's this thing about the Iraq War that I kinda feel weird talking about. I hate to sound like everyone else who's all, \"I knew it was a bad idea from the start!\"  But, honestly, it's just...  It feels like everyone agrees it was a mess except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong. You see it everywhere.  Poll after poll, people from the US, Iraq, even around the world, say it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think we should have never gone there. Even a lot of our own soldiers feel that way!\n\nIt's been a total disaster from the beginning.  And getting out is going to be another disaster. Honestly, it feels like anything we do in the Middle East just turns into a nightmare.\n\nIt's like we don't get it.  The US and the Middle East, we're just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. It's not how things work there.\n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about all the consequences is just reckless. It's like falling into quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some fancy reasons for staying, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually, maybe over a year, I wouldn't mind. But leaving now would be the best.\n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and some even want us to leave right now. Those are the people we're trying to help!  Maybe they know what's best for them. If we ask them and they say leave, at least we can say we tried to do what they wanted.\n\nMaybe then, if things go bad, we can step in and actually be the good guys.  I mean, we're never going to be totally loved in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Um, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  It's not just about women though. It seems to depend on what kind of work you do.  I mean, overall, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  Lots of guys struggle with the idea of working under a woman because of how society has always been. So, women often see jobs they're totally qualified for, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those top business roles.  And, it's kind of the same for men too. Like, in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's not really common to see a man doing those things. People often judge them for it, thinking a man should be working and making money for the family. It can be really hard on them, especially if it's always been their dream to stay home with the kids and help out, even if the wife has the better job.  It just works for them, but society doesn't get it.  And in fashion, sometimes people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because guys who are into fashion are often seen as having different lifestyles.  So if a guy has a typical lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might think, \"How can you really know about fashion if you're not a woman?\"  It's like they don't think he understands women's fashion.  \n\nSo, depending on the field, I definitely feel like there's gender discrimination in the US. Changing things is tough because society has these set ideas, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change is slow. I think we're making progress though. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are staying home with the kids and it's becoming more okay.  People are starting to see that it doesn't always have to be a certain way. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their female friends and wives and realizing that guys can know about fashion too. You kind of have to promote these different types of people by showing the good qualities without pushing too hard. If you force it, people resist. \n\nI think we're in a good place where things are starting to change naturally. I don't know if there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time.   \n\nOh, and by the way, it's not just about gender. People can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their education too. Like, if someone grew up on a farm and their grammar isn't perfect, but they're super smart and work their way up to a CEO position, other guys might look down on them and think they aren't serious because of their grammar. It's like, who knows what they're really saying if they can't speak properly. So yeah, there's discrimination based on a lot of things.",
            "So, basically, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the books as a criminal offense. You know, like a parking ticket instead of jail time.  My understanding is that if you get caught, it's still gonna mess with your job applications and stuff, even if it's not as bad as a full-blown arrest. The thing is, even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about those future consequences. But, on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest and process people for marijuana.  It costs a lot to keep them in jail, take them to court, and everything else.   So, for places that are struggling financially, it makes sense that they wouldn't want to decriminalize it, even if it would save them money. Some places just don't want to do it, even if they know it would be good for their budget. But, places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's totally fine. I bet they're using the money they saved to help people in need.  \n\nIt's important because we don't want weed everywhere, you know? There are other reasons why it shouldn't be super easy to get. But the money stuff is a big deal too.\n\nWhat if it got completely legal? Like cigarettes? Then everyone would be smoking it everywhere, and we'd have people driving high. And even now, it's still kind of taboo in a lot of places. It would just feel weird to have it so open.  \n\n\nI think alcohol messes with your motor skills worse, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. But they both have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it better than others. It's hard to say what's worse because it depends on the person.",
            "Hmmm...this whole Catholic thing, it's a mixed bag, you know?\n\nOn one hand, I get why people like them. They've got these strong traditions, things they've been doing for ages. Feels kinda comforting, like you've got roots. But hanging on too tight can be a problem too, gotta be able to bend with the times. \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know, they take it seriously, like going to church every week is a must. And the rules?  They're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like they think only *perfect* Catholics belong, and they're not so welcoming to folks who aren't exactly on the same page, or even from different religions.\n\nTake my parents, for example.  My mom was Catholic, my dad was Episcopalian, and the church wouldn't marry them!  Saying you love everyone but then not accepting them? Kinda hypocritical, right? It's like they preach love but then act closed off.\n\nThe church tells you to do good things, but sometimes their way of doing things just feels stuck in the past.  \n\nNow, some folks say letting priests marry would be a good idea, but honestly, I don't think it would stop the bad stuff. It's a separate issue, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they'll probably do it no matter what.  Being married doesn't change that.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage is really tough. I can't say one side is right or wrong, but it's definitely the hardest issue we're facing right now. It's like a balancing act between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.  It's super tricky, you know?  Like, should the government get involved in defining marriage at all? If it's a religious thing, shouldn't it be up to the churches?  Take baptism, for example, no one gets special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union, like two people coming together. The government shouldn't care what kind of marriage it is, just that two people are united.  And speaking of different types of marriage, this whole gay marriage thing... it's just two people wanting to be together, right?  If everyone can agree on a solution, shouldn't it become a national law?  But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's crazy! It feels like such a big deal to some people, but it doesn't seem like a good reason to change the constitution.",
            "Hmm...growing up in a Christian home, things like homosexuality are kinda confusing for me.  I've got plenty of gay friends, you see? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a big national debate, though.  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to legalize gay marriage. You know, like some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  If you live in a state that's okay with gay marriage, well,  that's just how it is there. You kinda chose to live there, right?  I think everyone deserves the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight. So, let each state make its own call. \n\nI already kinda said it, but it just feels wrong for someone like Bush, who doesn't live in every state, to ban gay marriage for the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide. I just don't think he should have that much power. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in who wants to lift the ban, it'll just be back and forth. It's better to let each state figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the decision.",
            "Okay, so let me get this straight. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? If you put something on there, anyone can see it, not just your friends.  Even if school officials aren't looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home. \n\nThink about it, if they're looking at Myspace to keep kids safe, like stopping a school shooting, that seems okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect students, right?  \n\nBut, if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy.  It's different when they're trying to prevent something bad from happening. \n\nIt's easier to express yourself in writing, so I guess I could say more about that. Since Myspace is public, if you post something and don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of silly. Everything you do online can come back to bite you later.\n\nLike, what you do in college could come back to haunt you when you're older. Once something is online, it's out there forever. \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy to look at Myspace if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen.  It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they want to know it's a safe place.\n\nMy teacher told me that schools have to do things like lock downs and drills to keep everyone safe. They want to be prepared for anything, like a school shooting.",
            "Okay, so, about this war...At first, I was all for it. Nine Eleven really hit me hard—it felt personal. I wanted to fight back, to dish out the same kind of trouble they caused us. Looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. It felt like we rushed into things without a real plan, and it just backfired. \n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It seems like those people are too busy fighting each other to bother with us. What's the point of us being there if they can't even get along? Honestly,  because of Nine Eleven, I don't really care what happens over there anymore. I just feel like they're all so different from us. They fight and fight, but they can't seem to solve anything on their own.\n\nWe went in unprepared. We didn't know what we were walking into, and war over there is unlike anything we've ever seen. They're just brutal, and I don't think they care about improving their country. They just want us out. I think that's fine with me—we should just leave.\n\nHonestly, I think we were all hyped up and angry, more than anything. We weren't thinking clearly about the consequences or how they'd react to us trying to change their whole way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge, and President Bush went along with it because the people wanted it.\n\nI get it, though. After Nine Eleven, we couldn't just ignore what happened. We had to do something. But maybe we could have done it differently.  We should have had a better plan, been clearer about our goals, and worked together better. There was no unity, no clear direction. \n\nI just think we went in with too much emotion and anger, and that's what we created there.  \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to change them. Maybe they'll always be like this. I don't know. I've said enough."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church needs to update some of its ideas.  \n\nA lot of people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very open-minded about things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but they seem a bit stuck in the past.\n\nIf they were more open to modern thinking, I think they wouldn't worry so much about losing people. I've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with its stance on these topics. They feel like the Church is wrong about these things.\n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a place where it's seen as completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage - if you support that, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the scandals we've seen. It's hard to say for sure if things would be different.\n\n\nIt just seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.",
            "Ehm...you know, I'm okay with gay marriage.  I don't think it's something you choose, like it's just how you are, ya know?  I don't think we should blame people for being gay. So, it feels wrong to say that a man and woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. It just doesn't seem fair.\n\nHonestly, I haven't thought about this too much, but I feel like it's wrong to say that. It's not like someone decides to be gay, right?  Just like I was born straight, someone else might be born gay.  It's not a choice.\n\n(clears throat) Yeah, I think it's wrong to stop people from getting married just because they're the same gender.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved, because it's not really a legal issue or something they should decide. It's more of a personal thing.  I don't want it to feel like we're putting gay people on display or making them feel like they made a mistake.\n\nSo I don't think the government should have anything to say about it. It's just not their place.\n\nIt's kind of complicated, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI guess I don't think the government should be involved because it doesn't affect national security or anything like that. It's not a moral issue. It's just about people's lives and who they love.\n\nIt just feels wrong to me to tell people they can't marry because of who they are. It's like how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "Okay, here's the thing about gay marriage.  There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some folks think that same-sex couples are a threat to families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're different but both are fruit.  It comes down to basic rights, like health care and property.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick. It's messed up if you're committed to someone and they can't be there for you when you need them. Studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not anything else.  \n\nWhat really bothers me is that people get hung up on the religious angle. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they just want a legal marriage certificate. Keep religion and government separate, right? It's like saying someone can't get married because their religion doesn't approve - that's not fair.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but there's no proof that kids raised by gay parents are any different.  It's about good parenting, not who the parents are. In some places, kids from gay families get bullied just for being different. That's wrong.\n\nWe need the government to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and treating everyone fairly. [",
            "Okay, so here's the thing about working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer.  Just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful.  I mean, I get it, making it freely available to everyone? Big no-no. But for medical reasons? Definitely yes.  I mean,  illegal doesn't equal no good, right?  \n\nThink about it, pharmacies use all sorts of controlled substances like Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet -  things that are totally illegal for regular folks. But doctors use them all the time because they can help people.  It's just that there's this crazy stigma around marijuana. We shouldn't judge something just because it's illegal. \n\nAlcohol is a good example, too.  It's legal but can be awful if you abuse it.  Marijuana can be abused too, but it's not as bad.  Maybe we should start slow with marijuana, make it legal gradually.  First, we need to ditch the bad image we have of it.  If we can get people to see it as something that can be used responsibly, then things might change. \n\nPeople think marijuana is super dangerous just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop thinking of it as this horrible drug, people might be more willing to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "So, yeah, I think the church has definitely changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be, you know? When I was a kid, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too. But now that I'm older, they have this teenager mass, and it's only thirty minutes long! People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see people coming straight from the beach in their swimsuits, families rushing in late, the whole deal. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed overall. \n\nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed about the changes. As for other stuff, I don't really know much about the inner workings of the church, but that's the church I know.\n\n\nRegarding all those accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests get married would have stopped it.  After all, there are married men who still become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not, it's about the person.  It's their choice to become a priest, and some religions allow priests to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  If they really want to marry and practice their faith, maybe they should consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia might be based on genetics,  something you're born with. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually, even if they try to hide it.  I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\nSo, you see, at first I was okay with the whole situation, but everyone was still pretty shaken up after 9/11. I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration, they linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We know now that none of that was true. It really bothers me that they led people astray like that.  Honestly, the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it yet.  Even Colin Powell, after his big speech at the UN, admitted he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then!  That's just wrong, plain and simple. To me, that's a serious offense. They don't seem to care about the Constitution at all, not since 9/11 anyway.  It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nI read in this book by a former Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – that the younger Bush was basically out for revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration. Plus, he probably wanted to control more of the world's energy supply.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nIt's been going on for far too long. Pulling out right now would be messy, though.  The country could easily fall into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nSo, the UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia involved to help fix things. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could lead to even more problems down the road because Iraq's sovereignty would become a huge issue.  The current government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.  The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, has a bunch of seats in Parliament now.  There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of trouble.\n\n(laughs)\n\nI could go on, but it's probably best not to say it all out loud.",
            "Mmm hmm. Let me just talk about my thoughts on the war in Iraq. Honestly, I feel like it’s kind of pointless. It wasn't even officially declared a war, you know? It feels like it was just a way for us to retaliate against Iraq because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks.  \n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're still there trying to establish a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. ally, and maybe also to secure their oil. But staying there just keeps causing more problems and making people upset. \n\nPlus, building a democracy takes a long time. It's not something you can just force overnight. If we leave suddenly, they'll be angry because they'll feel like we messed everything up and left them to deal with the mess. It's a real dilemma.\n\nHonestly, this topic is really hard for me. I don't know that much about it. I guess I feel torn. On one hand, I want the war to end because it's causing so much suffering. There are so many families with loved ones in Iraq, and I worry about them.  \n\nBut on the other hand, I don't want to leave Iraq in a worse state. It seems like our involvement has already caused a lot of chaos, and trying to force our way of life on them could make things even worse. I worry that it will just fuel more resentment and violence.\n\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really sad.",
            "Hmm... this whole issue about making it legal, it just feels wrong, you know? Like, it shouldn't be up to the government to decide. Our constitution, it clearly says separation of church and state.  It's written right there. Trying to force this on everyone, it feels like going against what's already been decided.  Plus, it seems like people pushing to make it illegal are just favoring one church's beliefs over others.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians aren't on board with it, except maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important, it's what makes religious freedom possible in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It would go against what's already in the constitution and would probably be the only amendment that restricts people instead of the government. \n\nHonestly, I don't think the federal government should have anything to do with this.  I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're trying to push their religion over everyone else's.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government.  There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't even impact the economy or anything like that.  It might even help society in some ways.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq... I don't really believe the government was completely honest with the people about why we went to war. They tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really related. The government used the fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one without a good reason.  This war feels a lot like Vietnam – we made the same mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The US just kicked out Iraq's government without a plan for what would happen next, which created chaos. \n\nThey wanted to put in a democracy, just like in Vietnam, but it's a really difficult and long process. It wasn't a clear victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss because there are always going to be people who resist, even if they want change. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there, and it's almost 2007, yet we're still losing soldiers. We're trying to train Iraqi troops, but it's taking forever. The US government didn't seem to understand how long and hard it takes to establish a new government. \n\nIt's complicated. We went in there, and now it's hard to just leave. We took away their government and way of life, so what do we do now? It's a tough choice. We risk more American lives for a democratic Iraq, but how many is too many? \n\nWhy are we focusing on Iraq and not other countries that need this kind of change? I think it might be about the oil.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. North Korea has those weapons, but we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not sure that will happen.",
            "Hmm...let me see... I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I truly believe it's a personal choice, you know? And studies show it's more about biology than anything else.  It's not fair to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong, you know? \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something between two people.  Like in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because the law won't let them. But they live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and doing normal things. \n\nIt's crazy how some people, like Bush, try to play God and decide what marriage means.  I think it's ridiculous. \n\nThere's tons of research showing that being gay is a biological thing, something you're born with. It's not a choice.\n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married they can just elope to Vegas and do it secretly. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a big public scandal. It shouldn't be a big deal, you know? It should be a private matter, not something the government gets involved in.",

What you post online can shape how people view you. If you're talking about violent things, someone might get worried. You can't just put anything out there.\n\nThe internet is huge, anyone can see it. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. So, if someone sees something concerning online, they might tell the school. They can't ignore it, because if something bad happens, they might have been able to stop it.\n\nIt's tricky though, because sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's serious. It could be a harmless experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. In one case, someone overheard something in school and told the school. They looked at the student's Facebook and found some posts that seemed harmless, but in light of the situation, they were worrisome.\n\nBasically, once you put something online, it's out there. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared it publicly. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger.",
            "This war feels like it's been going on forever.  In the beginning, I understood the goal – to bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove something to the world.  \n\nI even wonder if the reasons for starting the war were a bit shaky to begin with. There were those old issues between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein, and I can't help but think they played a part.\n\nIf the goal truly was to help people gain a fair political system, that would be a good reason for war. But if there were personal vendettas involved, then it wouldn't be right.\n\nAnyway, the war dragged on for way too long.  We made our point in the first few months, but now it just feels endless.\n\nI mean, if our goal was to free people from a tyrannical leader, that's a worthy cause. But over time, I think our reasons have gotten muddled. It feels like we're just stuck in a cycle of fighting, needing to declare victory, even if we've lost sight of what we're fighting for. \n\nThis war needs to end.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, money that could be used to help our own people. We have so many problems here at home – poverty, education, healthcare – that deserve our attention.\n\nIt's just not right to keep spending so much money on a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "Let me ask, though, isn't it kind of okay that someone found that information online?  Like, wasn't it good that someone saw it and was able to stop something bad from happening?\n\nI mean, it's tricky, right? You can't have someone watching every single student's profile all the time. It would be unfair to pick on certain kids and snoop on them just because they might be up to something.  \n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for specific things? \n\nIt's similar to how I feel about my own social media. I have Facebook, and it's scary to think about how much information is out there and how people can find it. I've heard stories about creeps who can easily get your information and even get you to meet up with them. It makes me nervous because they can learn a lot about you from your profile – your interests, your friends, even your schedule.\n\nI try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I also want to connect with my friends.\n\nIt's a tough balance. It's weird to think about schools banning Myspace, though. How can they really control what their students do online?  It feels like an invasion of privacy, even if they think they're trying to protect us.",
            "Hmm... Okay, so there's this thing about the Iraq War that I kinda feel weird talking about. I hate to sound like everyone else who's all, \"I knew it was a bad idea from the start!\"  But, honestly, it's just...  It feels like everyone agrees it was a mess except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong. You see it everywhere.  Poll after poll, people from the US, Iraq, even around the world, say it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think we should have never gone there. Even a lot of our own soldiers feel that way!\n\nIt's been a total disaster from the beginning.  And getting out is going to be another disaster. Honestly, it feels like anything we do in the Middle East just turns into a nightmare.\n\nIt's like we don't get it.  The US and the Middle East, we're just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. It's not how things work there.\n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about all the consequences is just reckless. It's like falling into quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some fancy reasons for staying, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually, maybe over a year, I wouldn't mind. But leaving now would be the best.\n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and some even want us to leave right now. Those are the people we're trying to help!  Maybe they know what's best for them. If we ask them and they say leave, at least we can say we tried to do what they wanted.\n\nMaybe then, if things go bad, we can step in and actually be the good guys.  I mean, we're never going to be totally loved in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Um, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  It's not just about women though. It seems to depend on what kind of work you do.  I mean, overall, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  Lots of guys struggle with the idea of working under a woman because of how society has always been. So, women often see jobs they're totally qualified for, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those top business roles.  And, it's kind of the same for men too. Like, in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's not really common to see a man doing those things. People often judge them for it, thinking a man should be working and making money for the family. It can be really hard on them, especially if it's always been their dream to stay home with the kids and help out, even if the wife has the better job.  It just works for them, but society doesn't get it.  And in fashion, sometimes people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because guys who are into fashion are often seen as having different lifestyles.  So if a guy has a typical lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might think, \"How can you really know about fashion if you're not a woman?\"  It's like they don't think he understands women's fashion.  \n\nSo, depending on the field, I definitely feel like there's gender discrimination in the US. Changing things is tough because society has these set ideas, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change is slow. I think we're making progress though. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are staying home with the kids and it's becoming more okay.  People are starting to see that it doesn't always have to be a certain way. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their female friends and wives and realizing that guys can know about fashion too. You kind of have to promote these different types of people by showing the good qualities without pushing too hard. If you force it, people resist. \n\nI think we're in a good place where things are starting to change naturally. I don't know if there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time.   \n\nOh, and by the way, it's not just about gender. People can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their education too. Like, if someone grew up on a farm and their grammar isn't perfect, but they're super smart and work their way up to a CEO position, other guys might look down on them and think they aren't serious because of their grammar. It's like, who knows what they're really saying if they can't speak properly. So yeah, there's discrimination based on a lot of things.",
            "So, basically, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the books as a criminal offense. You know, like a parking ticket instead of jail time.  My understanding is that if you get caught, it's still gonna mess with your job applications and stuff, even if it's not as bad as a full-blown arrest. The thing is, even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about those future consequences. But, on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest and process people for marijuana.  It costs a lot to keep them in jail, take them to court, and everything else.   So, for places that are struggling financially, it makes sense that they wouldn't want to decriminalize it, even if it would save them money. Some places just don't want to do it, even if they know it would be good for their budget. But, places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's totally fine. I bet they're using the money they saved to help people in need.  \n\nIt's important because we don't want weed everywhere, you know? There are other reasons why it shouldn't be super easy to get. But the money stuff is a big deal too.\n\nWhat if it got completely legal? Like cigarettes? Then everyone would be smoking it everywhere, and we'd have people driving high. And even now, it's still kind of taboo in a lot of places. It would just feel weird to have it so open.  \n\n\nI think alcohol messes with your motor skills worse, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. But they both have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it better than others. It's hard to say what's worse because it depends on the person.",
            "Hmmm...this whole Catholic thing, it's a mixed bag, you know?\n\nOn one hand, I get why people like them. They've got these strong traditions, things they've been doing for ages. Feels kinda comforting, like you've got roots. But hanging on too tight can be a problem too, gotta be able to bend with the times. \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know, they take it seriously, like going to church every week is a must. And the rules?  They're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like they think only *perfect* Catholics belong, and they're not so welcoming to folks who aren't exactly on the same page, or even from different religions.\n\nTake my parents, for example.  My mom was Catholic, my dad was Episcopalian, and the church wouldn't marry them!  Saying you love everyone but then not accepting them? Kinda hypocritical, right? It's like they preach love but then act closed off.\n\nThe church tells you to do good things, but sometimes their way of doing things just feels stuck in the past.  \n\nNow, some folks say letting priests marry would be a good idea, but honestly, I don't think it would stop the bad stuff. It's a separate issue, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they'll probably do it no matter what.  Being married doesn't change that.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage is really tough. I can't say one side is right or wrong, but it's definitely the hardest issue we're facing right now. It's like a balancing act between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.  It's super tricky, you know?  Like, should the government get involved in defining marriage at all? If it's a religious thing, shouldn't it be up to the churches?  Take baptism, for example, no one gets special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union, like two people coming together. The government shouldn't care what kind of marriage it is, just that two people are united.  And speaking of different types of marriage, this whole gay marriage thing... it's just two people wanting to be together, right?  If everyone can agree on a solution, shouldn't it become a national law?  But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's crazy! It feels like such a big deal to some people, but it doesn't seem like a good reason to change the constitution.",
            "Hmm...growing up in a Christian home, things like homosexuality are kinda confusing for me.  I've got plenty of gay friends, you see? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a big national debate, though.  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to legalize gay marriage. You know, like some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  If you live in a state that's okay with gay marriage, well,  that's just how it is there. You kinda chose to live there, right?  I think everyone deserves the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight. So, let each state make its own call. \n\nI already kinda said it, but it just feels wrong for someone like Bush, who doesn't live in every state, to ban gay marriage for the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide. I just don't think he should have that much power. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in who wants to lift the ban, it'll just be back and forth. It's better to let each state figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the decision.",
            "Okay, so let me get this straight. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? If you put something on there, anyone can see it, not just your friends.  Even if school officials aren't looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home. \n\nThink about it, if they're looking at Myspace to keep kids safe, like stopping a school shooting, that seems okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect students, right?  \n\nBut, if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy.  It's different when they're trying to prevent something bad from happening. \n\nIt's easier to express yourself in writing, so I guess I could say more about that. Since Myspace is public, if you post something and don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of silly. Everything you do online can come back to bite you later.\n\nLike, what you do in college could come back to haunt you when you're older. Once something is online, it's out there forever. \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy to look at Myspace if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen.  It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they want to know it's a safe place.\n\nMy teacher told me that schools have to do things like lock downs and drills to keep everyone safe. They want to be prepared for anything, like a school shooting.",
            "Okay, so, about this war...At first, I was all for it. Nine Eleven really hit me hard—it felt personal. I wanted to fight back, to dish out the same kind of trouble they caused us. Looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. It felt like we rushed into things without a real plan, and it just backfired. \n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It seems like those people are too busy fighting each other to bother with us. What's the point of us being there if they can't even get along? Honestly,  because of Nine Eleven, I don't really care what happens over there anymore. I just feel like they're all so different from us. They fight and fight, but they can't seem to solve anything on their own.\n\nWe went in unprepared. We didn't know what we were walking into, and war over there is unlike anything we've ever seen. They're just brutal, and I don't think they care about improving their country. They just want us out. I think that's fine with me—we should just leave.\n\nHonestly, I think we were all hyped up and angry, more than anything. We weren't thinking clearly about the consequences or how they'd react to us trying to change their whole way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge, and President Bush went along with it because the people wanted it.\n\nI get it, though. After Nine Eleven, we couldn't just ignore what happened. We had to do something. But maybe we could have done it differently.  We should have had a better plan, been clearer about our goals, and worked together better. There was no unity, no clear direction. \n\nI just think we went in with too much emotion and anger, and that's what we created there.  \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to change them. Maybe they'll always be like this. I don't know. I've said enough."
