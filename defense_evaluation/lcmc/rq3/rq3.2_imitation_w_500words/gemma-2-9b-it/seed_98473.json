            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs to update its thinking in a few ways. \n\nFolks are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's partly because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. See, the Church has strong opinions on these matters, which is fine, but some of those views feel a bit outdated. \n\nI think if they were a bit more open-minded, they wouldn't have to worry about people leaving. \n\nI've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. They feel the Church has the wrong perspective. \n\nTake abortion, for example. If you believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable in a place that condemns it. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to belong to a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to marry.  But I'm not sure if that would have stopped recent scandals. \n\nIt's tough to say if being married or having women priests would have changed things. It's just hard to know.\n\nI mean, the Church says priests are \"married to God,\" but everyone else has a job and a family life. Why can't priests have both?",
            "Hmm...this whole gay marriage thing, you know? I'm not against it at all.  I just don't think it's a choice people make, like deciding to be this way or that.  It's just how they are, right?  So why should we judge them for it?  It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nTo be honest, I haven't really thought about it too much. But it just feels wrong to me, like saying someone's love is less valid because of who they love.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should be involved. It's not like a legal issue or a moral one, at least not in my opinion. It's just about people loving each other.  Why should we put them on display like they did something wrong?  We shouldn't be punishing people for who they are.\n\nIt just seems like the government has no business interfering in people's lives like this. It's about love, and love shouldn't be controlled.",
            "Okay, so like, I think gay marriage should totally be legal. Why not, right?  Some folks think gay couples are bad news for straight families, but that's just not true. They're different, you know? Like, two sides of the same coin - same thing, different flips.  It's all about rights, too.  Stuff like taxes and health care. Like, if you're sick, your partner can't be there for you if you're not officially family.  Isn't that crazy? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?  And studies show that gay couples are just as happy as straight couples.  It's the same deal! The thing is, people get hung up on this idea that gay marriage is about churches, but it's really just about a legal document.  Like, why can't the government recognize their relationship? It's like separate but unequal - it doesn't make sense.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and stuff, but honestly, gay parents are just like straight parents. They love their kids, they care for them.  It's about the individuals, not their sexual orientation.  I've heard stories about kids of gay parents getting bullied, which is awful.  But that's society's problem, not the parents.\n\nThe government should totally get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about basic rights and equality.  It's frustrating that some people base their opinions on religion and morality, but everyone's beliefs are different.  It's not fair to impose one group's views on everyone else. And honestly, some people think gay people are broken or damaged, which is just wrong. Science has proven that's not true.",
            "Okay, so like, I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. And you know, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be good for you, right?  I mean, I don't think it should be legal for everyone to just buy it, no way. But for medicine, I think it should be okay.  It's not like just because it's illegal, it's automatically bad.  There are lots of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet – those are all controlled, but we use them all the time because they help people.  It's kinda messed up to say it's not okay just because people have a bad image of marijuana.  We gotta look at the good stuff it can do.\n\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though, because you can really get addicted to it if you're not careful. But you can with alcohol too, so it's tricky.  Maybe we should make it legal gradually, not all at once, you know?  That way people can get used to it and learn to use it responsibly.  \n\nPeople think marijuana is so bad just because it's illegal. But it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine, for sure. If we change how people think about it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "Hmm... you know, I think churches have changed a lot since, like, the early 2000s. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was little, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore these cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, you know, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, and all my friends were there on the weekends. We'd just hang out. But now, they have this thing called Teen Mass – it's only thirty minutes long! And people dress so casually, especially in the summer. They come straight from the beach, in their swimsuits! Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up fancy, now people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.  \n\nOh, and I don't really know about all the church politics, but yeah, that's basically it. \n\nAs for those accusations against priests, I don't think letting women be priests or letting priests get married would have stopped that.  Some married men become pedophiles too, right? It's not about whether they're married or not. It's about the person.\n\nI mean, there are religions where priests can get married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  They have ministers who are married.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could look into a different religion.\n\nI think it's mostly genetic, you know? People are born that way. Maybe their upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly in their genes. You can't really change that even with marriage.",
            "Ugh,  you know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still super shaken up from 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses.  The Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was involved with Osama Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out to be a big lie. It really makes me mad! \n\nI just think the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN about it, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong, you know? It feels like they don't even care about the Constitution anymore. \n\nI think they went into office wanting to go to war.  There was even this guy, the Treasury Secretary, who wrote a book after he got kicked out of office, saying basically that. It seems like George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad. Plus, I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. \n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out right now could cause chaos and more people getting hurt. It seems they're trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize things, but I don't know if that's a good idea either. It could mess up Iraq's sovereignty even more.\n\nThe government there is falling apart. The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has a lot of seats in Parliament. It's all so complicated and messy.",
            "So, like, I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless, you know? It wasn't even a real war, like, they never officially declared it. It just feels like we went in there to get back at them for 9/11, like we were just punishing them. \n\nI don't follow the war too closely, so I don't know all the details. But it seems like we're just staying there to try and build democracy, which is a good thing, I guess, but it's taking forever. And then there's the oil, which is like, a major factor. \n\nBut honestly, it's just making everyone unhappy. If we stay, we're stuck trying to force democracy on them, which isn't going to happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad because we messed everything up and left them to deal with it on their own. It's a total mess.\n\nThis is a tough one, because I don't really know what to think. I feel bad for the soldiers and their families, and I want them to be safe. But I also worry about how this is making everyone feel. It's like we're creating more problems than we're solving.\n\nI think it's important to help, but it feels like we're just prolonging the conflict. And honestly, it's making Bush look bad. This could end up being another Vietnam, where we're seen as the bad guys.",
            "Okay, so I just don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or illegal.  I mean, our constitution clearly states separation of church and state, right? To try and make laws about this would be going against what's already written.  \n\nIt seems to me like people pushing to make it illegal are just picking one church's beliefs over others. Like, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some spots like Boston.  But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is super important for religious freedom in the US.  Even trying to make an amendment about this would be wrong, because it would go against the constitution and it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The guy pushing for this amendment is just trying to force his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any politician. There's no good reason to ban it, it won't help the economy or anything, and it might even be good for society.",
            "Ok, so about the war in Iraq... I don't think our government was totally straight with the people about why we went in.  Before the invasion, they tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really related.  They really played on people's emotions about 9/11 to get support for the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when we attack first. I think this war is like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for what came next – the chaos and power vacuum.  They tried to put in a democracy, like they did in Vietnam, pushing out communism and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut they should have known it would be a long, hard fight. It's not like Vietnam was a clear victory, either. Even with support from some Iraqis, there were so many insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people. \n\nBasically, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to do it, we should have planned better. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there, almost at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police, but it's a slow process.  \n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, easy win, but it's not.  Building a new government takes time and struggle – just look at our own history. It wasn't easy to get to the government we have today.  \n\nSo, what now? It's tough because we've been there so long. How can we just leave them after we took their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free Iraq?\n\nIf we're going to make countries democratic, why just Iraq? Why not others? I think it's partly about oil – that's where we get it from.  \n\nWe thought Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they weren't there.  Meanwhile, we know North Korea has them, but we're not attacking them.  I don't think the government is being honest enough about its reasons.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there. But I'm not sure if that will happen.",
            "Um, let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I truly believe it's a personal choice, something that science is showing more and more is likely biological, not a matter of choice.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control. It's just not fair.  \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  I don't think politics or the government should have any say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens between two people, within their homes and families.\n\nYou know, back home, there are a couple of openly gay couples in my neighborhood. They aren't married because they aren't allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go about their day, just like everyone else. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to decide what marriage means and how it should be defined. It's their personal lives, not his to control.\n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be something that's actually in your genes, a chemical thing in your brain. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose.  It's different from growing up in a certain environment or with certain influences. That's the biological side of it versus the sociological side.\n\nThe biggest thing that bothers me is the double standard.  If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas, no big deal. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it becomes a huge public spectacle. It feels like it should be a private matter, something that doesn't need to be in the news or debated by politicians. It's not the government's business.",

They'd feel awful if they didn't act on it.  \n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not.  Sometimes people are just messing around, you know? Like maybe the situation at school was just a big misunderstanding - maybe it was a project gone wrong for a sociology class or something. Or maybe it was something really serious.\n\nWhat happened was, someone heard someone else talking about something at school and told the authorities.  Then, they found out who it was, and they looked through their Facebook. There were some things on there that were kinda dark, and even though the person might have meant them as a joke, in the situation it sounded really serious.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, there's no privacy.  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online! You can't control what people think or how they take things. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their stuff, but if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI mean, they shouldn't be listening to their students' phone calls or messages, but if someone tells them something, they have to do something about it. It's not cool for teachers to make fake profiles and friend their students, either - that's just wrong. I wouldn't want my residents to be able to see my life on Facebook, you know? It's just not my place to share that kind of stuff.",
            "This war has just dragged on for far too long.  I remember when we first started, the goal was good – to help bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to show everyone how powerful we are.\n\nHonestly, I even wonder about the reasons we started this in the first place.  There were those old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, weren't there?  If we truly wanted to bring democracy to a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason to fight. But if it was about personal grudges, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we made our point those first few months, when we began the war. That was a powerful statement in itself. But it's been years now, and it just seems to be going on and on.\n\nI think if our goal was to help a country ruled by a tyrant, that was a noble reason to start. But over time, I feel like our reasons have become blurred and confused. It feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing to win and declare victory.\n\nThis war has gone on long enough. It's time to stop.  Eventually, their government and people will have to figure things out on their own. We've already drained our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have so many problems right here at home – poverty, healthcare, education... These are things we should be using that money for.\n\nBillions and billions are being spent on a war that no longer has a clear purpose. We have our own problems that need attention, like fixing roads, improving schools, and taking care of our citizens.  It's heartbreaking to see our money being spent to kill our own people in a foreign country for a cause that has been lost.",
            "Okay, so basically, someone found out about something on Myspace that could have been really bad, and they stopped it from happening. Is it wrong to look at other people's Myspace profiles?  \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy. If you put stuff on Myspace, it's kind of public.  I mean, yeah, you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nWhen you post things online, you have to understand that lots of people might see them. So, I think it was actually good that someone saw that and stopped something bad from happening.\n\nBut, it's tough because you can't have someone watching everyone's Myspace all day. It wouldn't be fair to single out certain students and check their profiles just because they might be up to something.\n\nMaybe it depends on the situation. If someone was looking for something specific, like evidence of a student planning something dangerous, then maybe it's different. But if someone was just randomly looking through profiles, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook, and it worries me that there are people out there who can see all this information about me. I saw a story on TV about a guy who could easily find someone's personal information online and even get them to meet up with him in just a few minutes.\n\nI definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they seem to know so much about me - my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, even my friends.\n\nI try to be careful about what I post, but it's hard. I use Facebook to connect with friends, so I don't want to limit it too much.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what. It's a tricky issue. \n\nI heard that some high schools banned Myspace, which seems strange to me. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, but I don't know if they have the right to do that.",
            "Honestly, this whole Iraq War thing makes me feel kind of hypocritical. I mean, I hate to jump on the bandwagon and say I was against it from the start, but I was. It's just that now, it feels like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except maybe those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nEverywhere you look, the polls show it - Americans, Iraqis, people all over the world - about 75 to 80% think it was a mistake. Even a lot of the U.S. troops there think it was a bad call and we should get out. \n\nTo me, it's been a disaster from the get-go.  Even before we got involved, it was a mess, and now leaving is going to be another disaster.  It's like quicksand.  \n\nI think it's just a clash of cultures, you know?  The U.S. and the Middle East are so different. This administration, and even the ones before it, just don't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country.  It's just turned into a complete nightmare.\n\nFrankly, I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some hopeful ideas about staying, but I haven't heard a good one yet. If they want to pull out gradually, over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that.  But just leaving now seems like the best option. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them want us out now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. \n\nIf we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, at least we can't be blamed if things go bad. We could say, \"Well, you guys made the decision.\"\n\nAt least then, if we decide to help out later, we'll be seen as the good guys.  Well, maybe not the *good* guys, but better than we are now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender bias is still a real issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It often depends on the field you work in. \n\nI feel women face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, many struggle to find themselves leading a team with a woman at the top.  This is because of how society has always been, you know?  Women often have the skills and qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those high-powered roles.  \n\nAnd it's similar for men, too. Think about fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's uncommon to see a man at home taking care of the kids. People often criticize that choice because society expects men to be the breadwinners. \n\nIt can be tough on men who want to stay home with their children, especially if their wives are the ones with the better job. It's working for their family, but society doesn't always understand. \n\nIn fashion, some people might not take a straight male seriously if he's into it. Maybe it's because they think men who are into fashion have a different lifestyle. So, if a guy fits the stereotypical \"masculine\" mold and works in fashion, people might question his knowledge and expertise.\n\nSo, I believe there's definitely gender bias in the US, but it varies depending on the industry. \n\nChanging it is tough because society has deeply ingrained ideas. We've made progress, but it's slow. We're seeing more women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads becoming more accepted.  Slowly, people are starting to understand.\n\nTo really shift things, we need to highlight the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. We can't be pushy, but we need to show that these individuals are valuable and deserving of respect. \n\nIt's a delicate balance. Change takes time, and we're making progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "So, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list.  Now it's more like a ticket, you know, like parking. You get a citation, not hauled off to jail. I think, if you get caught now, it won't be as bad for your job or anything like that.  The big worries people have, especially the young ones, is what happens later, even after it's not a crime.  But, it costs a lot of money to arrest folks, take them to court, and deal with all that. It's a lot of money, money that could be used for schools or helping people.   Places that are struggling financially, they just don't want to part with that money, even if it means letting people go for smaller stuff. Some places are just against marijuana, no matter what.  But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it makes sense. They probably have more money now to spend on good things.\n\nI mean, you don't want marijuana everywhere, in every shop, like cigarettes. That would be a problem. But the money thing is important too. There are other reasons why it might not be good to be totally open about it, you know? Like, it's still not accepted in many places, and having it out in the open could feel weird.   \n\nUm, you know what I mean? What was that? I can't hear you well.\n\nI think alcohol is worse for your driving, but marijuana can mess with your whole life more. Both have bad effects, but people react differently. Some people can handle anything, and some can't. It's hard to say what's better or worse, because everyone is different.",
            "Hmm, I'd say being Catholic has its pros and cons. On one hand, they have strong traditions and stick to them, which can be good for stability. But it's also important to be open to change, you know? Like, a lot of Catholics are super strict about going to church every week and following the rules. Sometimes it feels like they judge those who don't follow everything perfectly or even people from other religions.  Take my parents for example, my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith. That doesn't seem very accepting to me, you know?  It's like they say to love everyone, but then they don't act like it. \n\nIt's like the rules sometimes seem old-fashioned and don't match up with what they preach.  \n\nSome people think letting priests marry would be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop bad things from happening.  I mean, people who hurt kids probably wouldn't stop just because they're married. It's a different kind of issue altogether.",
            "Hmmm... this whole thing, it's really got me thinking. I'm still not sure what I think about it all.\n\nIt's tough to say who's right or wrong, y'know? But this issue, it's the trickiest one we're facing right now. It's a real tangle between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.\n\nIt's hard to define marriage without upsetting someone.\n\nI dunno, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same way.\n\nMarriage, should the government even define it?\n\nI mean, if you get baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right?\n\nSo why should they care if you're married?\n\nTo me, it's just a civil union: two people who want to be together.\n\nThey shouldn't mix religion with government stuff.\n\nJust look at it as two people coming together.\n\nAnd, you know, with gay marriage...\n\nIt's just two people wanting to be together.\n\nShould they care what kind of marriage it is?\n\nIf all the states can agree on something sensible, they should make it a federal law.\n\nBut trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just silly.\n\nThe constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.\n\nIt's important to people, sure, but not important enough for a major change like that.\n\nIt just doesn't feel right to me.",
            "Hmm...this whole thing about homosexuality is kinda confusing for me.  You see, I grew up in a Christian family, so it's a bit of a grey area.  I have lots of gay friends, so I don't dislike them or anything.  I just don't personally agree with their lifestyle.\n\nBut, I do think they should have the right to marry.  It shouldn't be a big national issue, you know?  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to allow gay marriage.  It's not fair for the president to make that decision for the whole country.\n\nThink about it, some states are very liberal, and others are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, you kinda have to accept their views, right?  \n\nI believe everyone should have the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I think it should be up to each state to decide about gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's right for the president to ban it nationwide.  Each state should be able to make its own choice.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how they run things.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in who supports gay marriage, they can just overturn the ban.  It's just going to be a constant back-and-forth.  It's better to let each state decide for themselves.  They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Okay, so, think about it this way. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Anything you put on there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So, if school officials can see it, even if they aren't using the school's name, it's not really a big deal. \n\nI mean, if they're checking Myspace to make sure students aren't doing anything dangerous, like drinking or smoking, that's different. It's like they're trying to catch kids doing something wrong, which is kind of wrong. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay.  \n\nIt's all about keeping everyone safe, you know?  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and sometimes that means looking into things even if it feels a little bit like an invasion of privacy. \n\nPlus, think about it, if you post something on the internet, it's out there forever. Even if you delete it, someone could have already seen it.",
            "Okay, so, about this war... at first, I was totally for it. Nine Eleven hit me hard, you know? I was ready to dish out some payback, same as they did here. But looking back, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without a real plan, kinda unprepared. And it backfired big time. \n\nHonestly, I'm against it now. I don't think it achieved anything.  Those people over there, they're too busy fighting each other to bother with us.  They can't even get along, so what difference does us being there make?\n\nNine Eleven changed things for me. I just don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like they're not even human, the way they fight each other. They can't solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there blind, not knowing what we were facing. War for them is different than it is for us. They're savage. They're not trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, I think we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up by the whole thing, not thinking straight about the consequences. We were fueled by revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because the people wanted it. \n\nI get why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't just let them get away with it. But we should've had a better plan. We were disorganized and unclear about our goals. There was no unity. \n\nWe were driven by anger and emotion, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're capable of changing them. They'll always be like that.\n\nI've said enough. It's been dragging on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just fall apart again once we leave. We can't be there forever."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs to update its thinking in a few ways. \n\nFolks are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's partly because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. See, the Church has strong opinions on these matters, which is fine, but some of those views feel a bit outdated. \n\nI think if they were a bit more open-minded, they wouldn't have to worry about people leaving. \n\nI've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. They feel the Church has the wrong perspective. \n\nTake abortion, for example. If you believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable in a place that condemns it. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to belong to a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to marry.  But I'm not sure if that would have stopped recent scandals. \n\nIt's tough to say if being married or having women priests would have changed things. It's just hard to know.\n\nI mean, the Church says priests are \"married to God,\" but everyone else has a job and a family life. Why can't priests have both?",
            "Hmm...this whole gay marriage thing, you know? I'm not against it at all.  I just don't think it's a choice people make, like deciding to be this way or that.  It's just how they are, right?  So why should we judge them for it?  It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nTo be honest, I haven't really thought about it too much. But it just feels wrong to me, like saying someone's love is less valid because of who they love.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should be involved. It's not like a legal issue or a moral one, at least not in my opinion. It's just about people loving each other.  Why should we put them on display like they did something wrong?  We shouldn't be punishing people for who they are.\n\nIt just seems like the government has no business interfering in people's lives like this. It's about love, and love shouldn't be controlled.",
            "Okay, so like, I think gay marriage should totally be legal. Why not, right?  Some folks think gay couples are bad news for straight families, but that's just not true. They're different, you know? Like, two sides of the same coin - same thing, different flips.  It's all about rights, too.  Stuff like taxes and health care. Like, if you're sick, your partner can't be there for you if you're not officially family.  Isn't that crazy? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?  And studies show that gay couples are just as happy as straight couples.  It's the same deal! The thing is, people get hung up on this idea that gay marriage is about churches, but it's really just about a legal document.  Like, why can't the government recognize their relationship? It's like separate but unequal - it doesn't make sense.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and stuff, but honestly, gay parents are just like straight parents. They love their kids, they care for them.  It's about the individuals, not their sexual orientation.  I've heard stories about kids of gay parents getting bullied, which is awful.  But that's society's problem, not the parents.\n\nThe government should totally get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about basic rights and equality.  It's frustrating that some people base their opinions on religion and morality, but everyone's beliefs are different.  It's not fair to impose one group's views on everyone else. And honestly, some people think gay people are broken or damaged, which is just wrong. Science has proven that's not true.",
            "Okay, so like, I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. And you know, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be good for you, right?  I mean, I don't think it should be legal for everyone to just buy it, no way. But for medicine, I think it should be okay.  It's not like just because it's illegal, it's automatically bad.  There are lots of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet – those are all controlled, but we use them all the time because they help people.  It's kinda messed up to say it's not okay just because people have a bad image of marijuana.  We gotta look at the good stuff it can do.\n\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though, because you can really get addicted to it if you're not careful. But you can with alcohol too, so it's tricky.  Maybe we should make it legal gradually, not all at once, you know?  That way people can get used to it and learn to use it responsibly.  \n\nPeople think marijuana is so bad just because it's illegal. But it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine, for sure. If we change how people think about it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "Hmm... you know, I think churches have changed a lot since, like, the early 2000s. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was little, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore these cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, you know, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, and all my friends were there on the weekends. We'd just hang out. But now, they have this thing called Teen Mass – it's only thirty minutes long! And people dress so casually, especially in the summer. They come straight from the beach, in their swimsuits! Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up fancy, now people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.  \n\nOh, and I don't really know about all the church politics, but yeah, that's basically it. \n\nAs for those accusations against priests, I don't think letting women be priests or letting priests get married would have stopped that.  Some married men become pedophiles too, right? It's not about whether they're married or not. It's about the person.\n\nI mean, there are religions where priests can get married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  They have ministers who are married.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could look into a different religion.\n\nI think it's mostly genetic, you know? People are born that way. Maybe their upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly in their genes. You can't really change that even with marriage.",
            "Ugh,  you know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still super shaken up from 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses.  The Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was involved with Osama Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out to be a big lie. It really makes me mad! \n\nI just think the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN about it, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong, you know? It feels like they don't even care about the Constitution anymore. \n\nI think they went into office wanting to go to war.  There was even this guy, the Treasury Secretary, who wrote a book after he got kicked out of office, saying basically that. It seems like George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad. Plus, I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. \n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out right now could cause chaos and more people getting hurt. It seems they're trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize things, but I don't know if that's a good idea either. It could mess up Iraq's sovereignty even more.\n\nThe government there is falling apart. The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has a lot of seats in Parliament. It's all so complicated and messy.",
            "So, like, I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless, you know? It wasn't even a real war, like, they never officially declared it. It just feels like we went in there to get back at them for 9/11, like we were just punishing them. \n\nI don't follow the war too closely, so I don't know all the details. But it seems like we're just staying there to try and build democracy, which is a good thing, I guess, but it's taking forever. And then there's the oil, which is like, a major factor. \n\nBut honestly, it's just making everyone unhappy. If we stay, we're stuck trying to force democracy on them, which isn't going to happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad because we messed everything up and left them to deal with it on their own. It's a total mess.\n\nThis is a tough one, because I don't really know what to think. I feel bad for the soldiers and their families, and I want them to be safe. But I also worry about how this is making everyone feel. It's like we're creating more problems than we're solving.\n\nI think it's important to help, but it feels like we're just prolonging the conflict. And honestly, it's making Bush look bad. This could end up being another Vietnam, where we're seen as the bad guys.",
            "Okay, so I just don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or illegal.  I mean, our constitution clearly states separation of church and state, right? To try and make laws about this would be going against what's already written.  \n\nIt seems to me like people pushing to make it illegal are just picking one church's beliefs over others. Like, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some spots like Boston.  But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is super important for religious freedom in the US.  Even trying to make an amendment about this would be wrong, because it would go against the constitution and it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The guy pushing for this amendment is just trying to force his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any politician. There's no good reason to ban it, it won't help the economy or anything, and it might even be good for society.",
            "Ok, so about the war in Iraq... I don't think our government was totally straight with the people about why we went in.  Before the invasion, they tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really related.  They really played on people's emotions about 9/11 to get support for the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when we attack first. I think this war is like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for what came next – the chaos and power vacuum.  They tried to put in a democracy, like they did in Vietnam, pushing out communism and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut they should have known it would be a long, hard fight. It's not like Vietnam was a clear victory, either. Even with support from some Iraqis, there were so many insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people. \n\nBasically, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to do it, we should have planned better. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there, almost at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police, but it's a slow process.  \n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, easy win, but it's not.  Building a new government takes time and struggle – just look at our own history. It wasn't easy to get to the government we have today.  \n\nSo, what now? It's tough because we've been there so long. How can we just leave them after we took their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free Iraq?\n\nIf we're going to make countries democratic, why just Iraq? Why not others? I think it's partly about oil – that's where we get it from.  \n\nWe thought Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they weren't there.  Meanwhile, we know North Korea has them, but we're not attacking them.  I don't think the government is being honest enough about its reasons.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there. But I'm not sure if that will happen.",
            "Um, let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I truly believe it's a personal choice, something that science is showing more and more is likely biological, not a matter of choice.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control. It's just not fair.  \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  I don't think politics or the government should have any say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens between two people, within their homes and families.\n\nYou know, back home, there are a couple of openly gay couples in my neighborhood. They aren't married because they aren't allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go about their day, just like everyone else. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to decide what marriage means and how it should be defined. It's their personal lives, not his to control.\n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be something that's actually in your genes, a chemical thing in your brain. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose.  It's different from growing up in a certain environment or with certain influences. That's the biological side of it versus the sociological side.\n\nThe biggest thing that bothers me is the double standard.  If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas, no big deal. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it becomes a huge public spectacle. It feels like it should be a private matter, something that doesn't need to be in the news or debated by politicians. It's not the government's business.",

They'd feel awful if they didn't act on it.  \n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not.  Sometimes people are just messing around, you know? Like maybe the situation at school was just a big misunderstanding - maybe it was a project gone wrong for a sociology class or something. Or maybe it was something really serious.\n\nWhat happened was, someone heard someone else talking about something at school and told the authorities.  Then, they found out who it was, and they looked through their Facebook. There were some things on there that were kinda dark, and even though the person might have meant them as a joke, in the situation it sounded really serious.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, there's no privacy.  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online! You can't control what people think or how they take things. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their stuff, but if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI mean, they shouldn't be listening to their students' phone calls or messages, but if someone tells them something, they have to do something about it. It's not cool for teachers to make fake profiles and friend their students, either - that's just wrong. I wouldn't want my residents to be able to see my life on Facebook, you know? It's just not my place to share that kind of stuff.",
            "This war has just dragged on for far too long.  I remember when we first started, the goal was good – to help bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to show everyone how powerful we are.\n\nHonestly, I even wonder about the reasons we started this in the first place.  There were those old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, weren't there?  If we truly wanted to bring democracy to a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason to fight. But if it was about personal grudges, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we made our point those first few months, when we began the war. That was a powerful statement in itself. But it's been years now, and it just seems to be going on and on.\n\nI think if our goal was to help a country ruled by a tyrant, that was a noble reason to start. But over time, I feel like our reasons have become blurred and confused. It feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing to win and declare victory.\n\nThis war has gone on long enough. It's time to stop.  Eventually, their government and people will have to figure things out on their own. We've already drained our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have so many problems right here at home – poverty, healthcare, education... These are things we should be using that money for.\n\nBillions and billions are being spent on a war that no longer has a clear purpose. We have our own problems that need attention, like fixing roads, improving schools, and taking care of our citizens.  It's heartbreaking to see our money being spent to kill our own people in a foreign country for a cause that has been lost.",
            "Okay, so basically, someone found out about something on Myspace that could have been really bad, and they stopped it from happening. Is it wrong to look at other people's Myspace profiles?  \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy. If you put stuff on Myspace, it's kind of public.  I mean, yeah, you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nWhen you post things online, you have to understand that lots of people might see them. So, I think it was actually good that someone saw that and stopped something bad from happening.\n\nBut, it's tough because you can't have someone watching everyone's Myspace all day. It wouldn't be fair to single out certain students and check their profiles just because they might be up to something.\n\nMaybe it depends on the situation. If someone was looking for something specific, like evidence of a student planning something dangerous, then maybe it's different. But if someone was just randomly looking through profiles, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook, and it worries me that there are people out there who can see all this information about me. I saw a story on TV about a guy who could easily find someone's personal information online and even get them to meet up with him in just a few minutes.\n\nI definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they seem to know so much about me - my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, even my friends.\n\nI try to be careful about what I post, but it's hard. I use Facebook to connect with friends, so I don't want to limit it too much.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what. It's a tricky issue. \n\nI heard that some high schools banned Myspace, which seems strange to me. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, but I don't know if they have the right to do that.",
            "Honestly, this whole Iraq War thing makes me feel kind of hypocritical. I mean, I hate to jump on the bandwagon and say I was against it from the start, but I was. It's just that now, it feels like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except maybe those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nEverywhere you look, the polls show it - Americans, Iraqis, people all over the world - about 75 to 80% think it was a mistake. Even a lot of the U.S. troops there think it was a bad call and we should get out. \n\nTo me, it's been a disaster from the get-go.  Even before we got involved, it was a mess, and now leaving is going to be another disaster.  It's like quicksand.  \n\nI think it's just a clash of cultures, you know?  The U.S. and the Middle East are so different. This administration, and even the ones before it, just don't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country.  It's just turned into a complete nightmare.\n\nFrankly, I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some hopeful ideas about staying, but I haven't heard a good one yet. If they want to pull out gradually, over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that.  But just leaving now seems like the best option. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them want us out now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. \n\nIf we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, at least we can't be blamed if things go bad. We could say, \"Well, you guys made the decision.\"\n\nAt least then, if we decide to help out later, we'll be seen as the good guys.  Well, maybe not the *good* guys, but better than we are now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender bias is still a real issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It often depends on the field you work in. \n\nI feel women face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, many struggle to find themselves leading a team with a woman at the top.  This is because of how society has always been, you know?  Women often have the skills and qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those high-powered roles.  \n\nAnd it's similar for men, too. Think about fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's uncommon to see a man at home taking care of the kids. People often criticize that choice because society expects men to be the breadwinners. \n\nIt can be tough on men who want to stay home with their children, especially if their wives are the ones with the better job. It's working for their family, but society doesn't always understand. \n\nIn fashion, some people might not take a straight male seriously if he's into it. Maybe it's because they think men who are into fashion have a different lifestyle. So, if a guy fits the stereotypical \"masculine\" mold and works in fashion, people might question his knowledge and expertise.\n\nSo, I believe there's definitely gender bias in the US, but it varies depending on the industry. \n\nChanging it is tough because society has deeply ingrained ideas. We've made progress, but it's slow. We're seeing more women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads becoming more accepted.  Slowly, people are starting to understand.\n\nTo really shift things, we need to highlight the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. We can't be pushy, but we need to show that these individuals are valuable and deserving of respect. \n\nIt's a delicate balance. Change takes time, and we're making progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "So, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list.  Now it's more like a ticket, you know, like parking. You get a citation, not hauled off to jail. I think, if you get caught now, it won't be as bad for your job or anything like that.  The big worries people have, especially the young ones, is what happens later, even after it's not a crime.  But, it costs a lot of money to arrest folks, take them to court, and deal with all that. It's a lot of money, money that could be used for schools or helping people.   Places that are struggling financially, they just don't want to part with that money, even if it means letting people go for smaller stuff. Some places are just against marijuana, no matter what.  But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it makes sense. They probably have more money now to spend on good things.\n\nI mean, you don't want marijuana everywhere, in every shop, like cigarettes. That would be a problem. But the money thing is important too. There are other reasons why it might not be good to be totally open about it, you know? Like, it's still not accepted in many places, and having it out in the open could feel weird.   \n\nUm, you know what I mean? What was that? I can't hear you well.\n\nI think alcohol is worse for your driving, but marijuana can mess with your whole life more. Both have bad effects, but people react differently. Some people can handle anything, and some can't. It's hard to say what's better or worse, because everyone is different.",
            "Hmm, I'd say being Catholic has its pros and cons. On one hand, they have strong traditions and stick to them, which can be good for stability. But it's also important to be open to change, you know? Like, a lot of Catholics are super strict about going to church every week and following the rules. Sometimes it feels like they judge those who don't follow everything perfectly or even people from other religions.  Take my parents for example, my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith. That doesn't seem very accepting to me, you know?  It's like they say to love everyone, but then they don't act like it. \n\nIt's like the rules sometimes seem old-fashioned and don't match up with what they preach.  \n\nSome people think letting priests marry would be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop bad things from happening.  I mean, people who hurt kids probably wouldn't stop just because they're married. It's a different kind of issue altogether.",
            "Hmmm... this whole thing, it's really got me thinking. I'm still not sure what I think about it all.\n\nIt's tough to say who's right or wrong, y'know? But this issue, it's the trickiest one we're facing right now. It's a real tangle between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.\n\nIt's hard to define marriage without upsetting someone.\n\nI dunno, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same way.\n\nMarriage, should the government even define it?\n\nI mean, if you get baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right?\n\nSo why should they care if you're married?\n\nTo me, it's just a civil union: two people who want to be together.\n\nThey shouldn't mix religion with government stuff.\n\nJust look at it as two people coming together.\n\nAnd, you know, with gay marriage...\n\nIt's just two people wanting to be together.\n\nShould they care what kind of marriage it is?\n\nIf all the states can agree on something sensible, they should make it a federal law.\n\nBut trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just silly.\n\nThe constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.\n\nIt's important to people, sure, but not important enough for a major change like that.\n\nIt just doesn't feel right to me.",
            "Hmm...this whole thing about homosexuality is kinda confusing for me.  You see, I grew up in a Christian family, so it's a bit of a grey area.  I have lots of gay friends, so I don't dislike them or anything.  I just don't personally agree with their lifestyle.\n\nBut, I do think they should have the right to marry.  It shouldn't be a big national issue, you know?  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to allow gay marriage.  It's not fair for the president to make that decision for the whole country.\n\nThink about it, some states are very liberal, and others are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, you kinda have to accept their views, right?  \n\nI believe everyone should have the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I think it should be up to each state to decide about gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's right for the president to ban it nationwide.  Each state should be able to make its own choice.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how they run things.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in who supports gay marriage, they can just overturn the ban.  It's just going to be a constant back-and-forth.  It's better to let each state decide for themselves.  They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Okay, so, think about it this way. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Anything you put on there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So, if school officials can see it, even if they aren't using the school's name, it's not really a big deal. \n\nI mean, if they're checking Myspace to make sure students aren't doing anything dangerous, like drinking or smoking, that's different. It's like they're trying to catch kids doing something wrong, which is kind of wrong. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay.  \n\nIt's all about keeping everyone safe, you know?  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and sometimes that means looking into things even if it feels a little bit like an invasion of privacy. \n\nPlus, think about it, if you post something on the internet, it's out there forever. Even if you delete it, someone could have already seen it.",
            "Okay, so, about this war... at first, I was totally for it. Nine Eleven hit me hard, you know? I was ready to dish out some payback, same as they did here. But looking back, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without a real plan, kinda unprepared. And it backfired big time. \n\nHonestly, I'm against it now. I don't think it achieved anything.  Those people over there, they're too busy fighting each other to bother with us.  They can't even get along, so what difference does us being there make?\n\nNine Eleven changed things for me. I just don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like they're not even human, the way they fight each other. They can't solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there blind, not knowing what we were facing. War for them is different than it is for us. They're savage. They're not trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, I think we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up by the whole thing, not thinking straight about the consequences. We were fueled by revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because the people wanted it. \n\nI get why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't just let them get away with it. But we should've had a better plan. We were disorganized and unclear about our goals. There was no unity. \n\nWe were driven by anger and emotion, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're capable of changing them. They'll always be like that.\n\nI've said enough. It's been dragging on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just fall apart again once we leave. We can't be there forever."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs to update its thinking in a few ways. \n\nFolks are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's partly because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. See, the Church has strong opinions on these matters, which is fine, but some of those views feel a bit outdated. \n\nI think if they were a bit more open-minded, they wouldn't have to worry about people leaving. \n\nI've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. They feel the Church has the wrong perspective. \n\nTake abortion, for example. If you believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable in a place that condemns it. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to belong to a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to marry.  But I'm not sure if that would have stopped recent scandals. \n\nIt's tough to say if being married or having women priests would have changed things. It's just hard to know.\n\nI mean, the Church says priests are \"married to God,\" but everyone else has a job and a family life. Why can't priests have both?",
            "Hmm...this whole gay marriage thing, you know? I'm not against it at all.  I just don't think it's a choice people make, like deciding to be this way or that.  It's just how they are, right?  So why should we judge them for it?  It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nTo be honest, I haven't really thought about it too much. But it just feels wrong to me, like saying someone's love is less valid because of who they love.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should be involved. It's not like a legal issue or a moral one, at least not in my opinion. It's just about people loving each other.  Why should we put them on display like they did something wrong?  We shouldn't be punishing people for who they are.\n\nIt just seems like the government has no business interfering in people's lives like this. It's about love, and love shouldn't be controlled.",
            "Okay, so like, I think gay marriage should totally be legal. Why not, right?  Some folks think gay couples are bad news for straight families, but that's just not true. They're different, you know? Like, two sides of the same coin - same thing, different flips.  It's all about rights, too.  Stuff like taxes and health care. Like, if you're sick, your partner can't be there for you if you're not officially family.  Isn't that crazy? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?  And studies show that gay couples are just as happy as straight couples.  It's the same deal! The thing is, people get hung up on this idea that gay marriage is about churches, but it's really just about a legal document.  Like, why can't the government recognize their relationship? It's like separate but unequal - it doesn't make sense.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and stuff, but honestly, gay parents are just like straight parents. They love their kids, they care for them.  It's about the individuals, not their sexual orientation.  I've heard stories about kids of gay parents getting bullied, which is awful.  But that's society's problem, not the parents.\n\nThe government should totally get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about basic rights and equality.  It's frustrating that some people base their opinions on religion and morality, but everyone's beliefs are different.  It's not fair to impose one group's views on everyone else. And honestly, some people think gay people are broken or damaged, which is just wrong. Science has proven that's not true.",
            "Okay, so like, I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. And you know, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be good for you, right?  I mean, I don't think it should be legal for everyone to just buy it, no way. But for medicine, I think it should be okay.  It's not like just because it's illegal, it's automatically bad.  There are lots of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet – those are all controlled, but we use them all the time because they help people.  It's kinda messed up to say it's not okay just because people have a bad image of marijuana.  We gotta look at the good stuff it can do.\n\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though, because you can really get addicted to it if you're not careful. But you can with alcohol too, so it's tricky.  Maybe we should make it legal gradually, not all at once, you know?  That way people can get used to it and learn to use it responsibly.  \n\nPeople think marijuana is so bad just because it's illegal. But it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine, for sure. If we change how people think about it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "Hmm... you know, I think churches have changed a lot since, like, the early 2000s. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was little, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore these cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, you know, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, and all my friends were there on the weekends. We'd just hang out. But now, they have this thing called Teen Mass – it's only thirty minutes long! And people dress so casually, especially in the summer. They come straight from the beach, in their swimsuits! Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up fancy, now people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.  \n\nOh, and I don't really know about all the church politics, but yeah, that's basically it. \n\nAs for those accusations against priests, I don't think letting women be priests or letting priests get married would have stopped that.  Some married men become pedophiles too, right? It's not about whether they're married or not. It's about the person.\n\nI mean, there are religions where priests can get married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  They have ministers who are married.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could look into a different religion.\n\nI think it's mostly genetic, you know? People are born that way. Maybe their upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly in their genes. You can't really change that even with marriage.",
            "Ugh,  you know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still super shaken up from 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses.  The Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was involved with Osama Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out to be a big lie. It really makes me mad! \n\nI just think the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN about it, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong, you know? It feels like they don't even care about the Constitution anymore. \n\nI think they went into office wanting to go to war.  There was even this guy, the Treasury Secretary, who wrote a book after he got kicked out of office, saying basically that. It seems like George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad. Plus, I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. \n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out right now could cause chaos and more people getting hurt. It seems they're trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize things, but I don't know if that's a good idea either. It could mess up Iraq's sovereignty even more.\n\nThe government there is falling apart. The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has a lot of seats in Parliament. It's all so complicated and messy.",
            "So, like, I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless, you know? It wasn't even a real war, like, they never officially declared it. It just feels like we went in there to get back at them for 9/11, like we were just punishing them. \n\nI don't follow the war too closely, so I don't know all the details. But it seems like we're just staying there to try and build democracy, which is a good thing, I guess, but it's taking forever. And then there's the oil, which is like, a major factor. \n\nBut honestly, it's just making everyone unhappy. If we stay, we're stuck trying to force democracy on them, which isn't going to happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad because we messed everything up and left them to deal with it on their own. It's a total mess.\n\nThis is a tough one, because I don't really know what to think. I feel bad for the soldiers and their families, and I want them to be safe. But I also worry about how this is making everyone feel. It's like we're creating more problems than we're solving.\n\nI think it's important to help, but it feels like we're just prolonging the conflict. And honestly, it's making Bush look bad. This could end up being another Vietnam, where we're seen as the bad guys.",
            "Okay, so I just don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or illegal.  I mean, our constitution clearly states separation of church and state, right? To try and make laws about this would be going against what's already written.  \n\nIt seems to me like people pushing to make it illegal are just picking one church's beliefs over others. Like, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some spots like Boston.  But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is super important for religious freedom in the US.  Even trying to make an amendment about this would be wrong, because it would go against the constitution and it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The guy pushing for this amendment is just trying to force his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any politician. There's no good reason to ban it, it won't help the economy or anything, and it might even be good for society.",
            "Ok, so about the war in Iraq... I don't think our government was totally straight with the people about why we went in.  Before the invasion, they tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really related.  They really played on people's emotions about 9/11 to get support for the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when we attack first. I think this war is like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for what came next – the chaos and power vacuum.  They tried to put in a democracy, like they did in Vietnam, pushing out communism and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut they should have known it would be a long, hard fight. It's not like Vietnam was a clear victory, either. Even with support from some Iraqis, there were so many insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people. \n\nBasically, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to do it, we should have planned better. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there, almost at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police, but it's a slow process.  \n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, easy win, but it's not.  Building a new government takes time and struggle – just look at our own history. It wasn't easy to get to the government we have today.  \n\nSo, what now? It's tough because we've been there so long. How can we just leave them after we took their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free Iraq?\n\nIf we're going to make countries democratic, why just Iraq? Why not others? I think it's partly about oil – that's where we get it from.  \n\nWe thought Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they weren't there.  Meanwhile, we know North Korea has them, but we're not attacking them.  I don't think the government is being honest enough about its reasons.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there. But I'm not sure if that will happen.",
            "Um, let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I truly believe it's a personal choice, something that science is showing more and more is likely biological, not a matter of choice.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control. It's just not fair.  \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  I don't think politics or the government should have any say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens between two people, within their homes and families.\n\nYou know, back home, there are a couple of openly gay couples in my neighborhood. They aren't married because they aren't allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go about their day, just like everyone else. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to decide what marriage means and how it should be defined. It's their personal lives, not his to control.\n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be something that's actually in your genes, a chemical thing in your brain. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose.  It's different from growing up in a certain environment or with certain influences. That's the biological side of it versus the sociological side.\n\nThe biggest thing that bothers me is the double standard.  If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas, no big deal. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it becomes a huge public spectacle. It feels like it should be a private matter, something that doesn't need to be in the news or debated by politicians. It's not the government's business.",

They'd feel awful if they didn't act on it.  \n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not.  Sometimes people are just messing around, you know? Like maybe the situation at school was just a big misunderstanding - maybe it was a project gone wrong for a sociology class or something. Or maybe it was something really serious.\n\nWhat happened was, someone heard someone else talking about something at school and told the authorities.  Then, they found out who it was, and they looked through their Facebook. There were some things on there that were kinda dark, and even though the person might have meant them as a joke, in the situation it sounded really serious.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, there's no privacy.  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online! You can't control what people think or how they take things. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their stuff, but if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI mean, they shouldn't be listening to their students' phone calls or messages, but if someone tells them something, they have to do something about it. It's not cool for teachers to make fake profiles and friend their students, either - that's just wrong. I wouldn't want my residents to be able to see my life on Facebook, you know? It's just not my place to share that kind of stuff.",
            "This war has just dragged on for far too long.  I remember when we first started, the goal was good – to help bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to show everyone how powerful we are.\n\nHonestly, I even wonder about the reasons we started this in the first place.  There were those old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, weren't there?  If we truly wanted to bring democracy to a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason to fight. But if it was about personal grudges, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we made our point those first few months, when we began the war. That was a powerful statement in itself. But it's been years now, and it just seems to be going on and on.\n\nI think if our goal was to help a country ruled by a tyrant, that was a noble reason to start. But over time, I feel like our reasons have become blurred and confused. It feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing to win and declare victory.\n\nThis war has gone on long enough. It's time to stop.  Eventually, their government and people will have to figure things out on their own. We've already drained our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have so many problems right here at home – poverty, healthcare, education... These are things we should be using that money for.\n\nBillions and billions are being spent on a war that no longer has a clear purpose. We have our own problems that need attention, like fixing roads, improving schools, and taking care of our citizens.  It's heartbreaking to see our money being spent to kill our own people in a foreign country for a cause that has been lost.",
            "Okay, so basically, someone found out about something on Myspace that could have been really bad, and they stopped it from happening. Is it wrong to look at other people's Myspace profiles?  \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy. If you put stuff on Myspace, it's kind of public.  I mean, yeah, you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nWhen you post things online, you have to understand that lots of people might see them. So, I think it was actually good that someone saw that and stopped something bad from happening.\n\nBut, it's tough because you can't have someone watching everyone's Myspace all day. It wouldn't be fair to single out certain students and check their profiles just because they might be up to something.\n\nMaybe it depends on the situation. If someone was looking for something specific, like evidence of a student planning something dangerous, then maybe it's different. But if someone was just randomly looking through profiles, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook, and it worries me that there are people out there who can see all this information about me. I saw a story on TV about a guy who could easily find someone's personal information online and even get them to meet up with him in just a few minutes.\n\nI definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they seem to know so much about me - my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, even my friends.\n\nI try to be careful about what I post, but it's hard. I use Facebook to connect with friends, so I don't want to limit it too much.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what. It's a tricky issue. \n\nI heard that some high schools banned Myspace, which seems strange to me. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, but I don't know if they have the right to do that.",
            "Honestly, this whole Iraq War thing makes me feel kind of hypocritical. I mean, I hate to jump on the bandwagon and say I was against it from the start, but I was. It's just that now, it feels like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except maybe those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nEverywhere you look, the polls show it - Americans, Iraqis, people all over the world - about 75 to 80% think it was a mistake. Even a lot of the U.S. troops there think it was a bad call and we should get out. \n\nTo me, it's been a disaster from the get-go.  Even before we got involved, it was a mess, and now leaving is going to be another disaster.  It's like quicksand.  \n\nI think it's just a clash of cultures, you know?  The U.S. and the Middle East are so different. This administration, and even the ones before it, just don't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country.  It's just turned into a complete nightmare.\n\nFrankly, I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some hopeful ideas about staying, but I haven't heard a good one yet. If they want to pull out gradually, over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that.  But just leaving now seems like the best option. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them want us out now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. \n\nIf we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, at least we can't be blamed if things go bad. We could say, \"Well, you guys made the decision.\"\n\nAt least then, if we decide to help out later, we'll be seen as the good guys.  Well, maybe not the *good* guys, but better than we are now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender bias is still a real issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It often depends on the field you work in. \n\nI feel women face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, many struggle to find themselves leading a team with a woman at the top.  This is because of how society has always been, you know?  Women often have the skills and qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those high-powered roles.  \n\nAnd it's similar for men, too. Think about fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's uncommon to see a man at home taking care of the kids. People often criticize that choice because society expects men to be the breadwinners. \n\nIt can be tough on men who want to stay home with their children, especially if their wives are the ones with the better job. It's working for their family, but society doesn't always understand. \n\nIn fashion, some people might not take a straight male seriously if he's into it. Maybe it's because they think men who are into fashion have a different lifestyle. So, if a guy fits the stereotypical \"masculine\" mold and works in fashion, people might question his knowledge and expertise.\n\nSo, I believe there's definitely gender bias in the US, but it varies depending on the industry. \n\nChanging it is tough because society has deeply ingrained ideas. We've made progress, but it's slow. We're seeing more women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads becoming more accepted.  Slowly, people are starting to understand.\n\nTo really shift things, we need to highlight the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. We can't be pushy, but we need to show that these individuals are valuable and deserving of respect. \n\nIt's a delicate balance. Change takes time, and we're making progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "So, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list.  Now it's more like a ticket, you know, like parking. You get a citation, not hauled off to jail. I think, if you get caught now, it won't be as bad for your job or anything like that.  The big worries people have, especially the young ones, is what happens later, even after it's not a crime.  But, it costs a lot of money to arrest folks, take them to court, and deal with all that. It's a lot of money, money that could be used for schools or helping people.   Places that are struggling financially, they just don't want to part with that money, even if it means letting people go for smaller stuff. Some places are just against marijuana, no matter what.  But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it makes sense. They probably have more money now to spend on good things.\n\nI mean, you don't want marijuana everywhere, in every shop, like cigarettes. That would be a problem. But the money thing is important too. There are other reasons why it might not be good to be totally open about it, you know? Like, it's still not accepted in many places, and having it out in the open could feel weird.   \n\nUm, you know what I mean? What was that? I can't hear you well.\n\nI think alcohol is worse for your driving, but marijuana can mess with your whole life more. Both have bad effects, but people react differently. Some people can handle anything, and some can't. It's hard to say what's better or worse, because everyone is different.",
            "Hmm, I'd say being Catholic has its pros and cons. On one hand, they have strong traditions and stick to them, which can be good for stability. But it's also important to be open to change, you know? Like, a lot of Catholics are super strict about going to church every week and following the rules. Sometimes it feels like they judge those who don't follow everything perfectly or even people from other religions.  Take my parents for example, my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith. That doesn't seem very accepting to me, you know?  It's like they say to love everyone, but then they don't act like it. \n\nIt's like the rules sometimes seem old-fashioned and don't match up with what they preach.  \n\nSome people think letting priests marry would be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop bad things from happening.  I mean, people who hurt kids probably wouldn't stop just because they're married. It's a different kind of issue altogether.",
            "Hmmm... this whole thing, it's really got me thinking. I'm still not sure what I think about it all.\n\nIt's tough to say who's right or wrong, y'know? But this issue, it's the trickiest one we're facing right now. It's a real tangle between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.\n\nIt's hard to define marriage without upsetting someone.\n\nI dunno, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same way.\n\nMarriage, should the government even define it?\n\nI mean, if you get baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right?\n\nSo why should they care if you're married?\n\nTo me, it's just a civil union: two people who want to be together.\n\nThey shouldn't mix religion with government stuff.\n\nJust look at it as two people coming together.\n\nAnd, you know, with gay marriage...\n\nIt's just two people wanting to be together.\n\nShould they care what kind of marriage it is?\n\nIf all the states can agree on something sensible, they should make it a federal law.\n\nBut trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just silly.\n\nThe constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.\n\nIt's important to people, sure, but not important enough for a major change like that.\n\nIt just doesn't feel right to me.",
            "Hmm...this whole thing about homosexuality is kinda confusing for me.  You see, I grew up in a Christian family, so it's a bit of a grey area.  I have lots of gay friends, so I don't dislike them or anything.  I just don't personally agree with their lifestyle.\n\nBut, I do think they should have the right to marry.  It shouldn't be a big national issue, you know?  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to allow gay marriage.  It's not fair for the president to make that decision for the whole country.\n\nThink about it, some states are very liberal, and others are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, you kinda have to accept their views, right?  \n\nI believe everyone should have the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I think it should be up to each state to decide about gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's right for the president to ban it nationwide.  Each state should be able to make its own choice.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how they run things.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in who supports gay marriage, they can just overturn the ban.  It's just going to be a constant back-and-forth.  It's better to let each state decide for themselves.  They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Okay, so, think about it this way. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Anything you put on there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So, if school officials can see it, even if they aren't using the school's name, it's not really a big deal. \n\nI mean, if they're checking Myspace to make sure students aren't doing anything dangerous, like drinking or smoking, that's different. It's like they're trying to catch kids doing something wrong, which is kind of wrong. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay.  \n\nIt's all about keeping everyone safe, you know?  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and sometimes that means looking into things even if it feels a little bit like an invasion of privacy. \n\nPlus, think about it, if you post something on the internet, it's out there forever. Even if you delete it, someone could have already seen it.",
            "Okay, so, about this war... at first, I was totally for it. Nine Eleven hit me hard, you know? I was ready to dish out some payback, same as they did here. But looking back, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without a real plan, kinda unprepared. And it backfired big time. \n\nHonestly, I'm against it now. I don't think it achieved anything.  Those people over there, they're too busy fighting each other to bother with us.  They can't even get along, so what difference does us being there make?\n\nNine Eleven changed things for me. I just don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like they're not even human, the way they fight each other. They can't solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there blind, not knowing what we were facing. War for them is different than it is for us. They're savage. They're not trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, I think we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up by the whole thing, not thinking straight about the consequences. We were fueled by revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because the people wanted it. \n\nI get why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't just let them get away with it. But we should've had a better plan. We were disorganized and unclear about our goals. There was no unity. \n\nWe were driven by anger and emotion, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're capable of changing them. They'll always be like that.\n\nI've said enough. It's been dragging on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just fall apart again once we leave. We can't be there forever."
