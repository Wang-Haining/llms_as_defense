            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmmm...I think the Catholic Church needs to catch up with the times in some ways. \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things.  Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  It's okay to have strong beliefs, but some of their views seem stuck in the past.  \n\nIf they were a little more open-minded, they might not worry so much about losing people.  I've heard that lots of folks are turning away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that says it's always wrong.  Or if you support gay marriage, you might feel out of place in a church that doesn't.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have women priests or allow priests to get married.  It's like, everyone else has a job and a family life, so why not priests?  They claim priests are \"married\" to God, but I think it's possible to be devoted to God and have a family too.",
            "Hmm...so, about gay marriage, I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you choose, right? So, I feel like gay people shouldn't have to deal with being judged for who they are. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but honestly, it just seems wrong to me.  \n\nIt's like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It's just how we are, you know?  It's not like they made a choice to be that way.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not a legal or moral issue, really.  It's not like they did something wrong. It's just who they are. It's not right to make them feel like they're different or that they made the wrong choice.\n\nIt's just not their place to interfere in people's lives like that.",
            "You know, I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's just no strong reason against it. Many folks worry that same-sex couples will somehow threaten \"traditional\" families, but it's not like that at all. It's like comparing apples and oranges, they're different, but still part of the same fruit basket.  \n\nThere are tons of rights involved, like with taxes, healthcare, and all that.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be there for you in the hospital if you're sick. They can't even visit!  It's crazy because if you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and successful as straight ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.\n\nSometimes people get hung up on the religious aspects, but gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, just a legal marriage certificate from the government.  It's like separating church and state, you know? \n\nI don't get why some religions are so against it. It's like saying, \"Our religion says no to this, so it should be illegal for everyone.\" That's not fair! If you're allowing civil unions, why not full marriage? It's like segregation – treating people differently just because they're different.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how gay couples will raise kids, but studies show they're just as good at it as straight couples. It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.\n\nHonestly, the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about time we all had equal rights.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you, working at the hospital pharmacy this summer, you realize some things. Just because something's illegal, doesn't mean it's totally bad. I mean, should we just make everything illegal?  I don't think so.  \n\nI get it, making drugs available to everyone might be a problem.  But, for medical reasons? Sure, why not?\n\nThere are tons of drugs that are illegal but we use them in the pharmacy all the time.  Like, oxycontin, Vicodin, percocet...those are serious drugs, controlled substances, but they help people.  If we're going to deny the good that marijuana can do just because it's considered taboo, that doesn't make sense to me.  We should look at the benefits, you know?\n\nAlcohol's different, I guess, but even then, if you abuse it, it can cause problems. Marijuana, it's a bit tricky.  Maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just jump right in.  That way, people can learn to use it responsibly.\n\nIt's all about the image people have of marijuana. It's illegal, so they think it's bad, right? But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we could change how people see it, maybe they'd use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "You know, I think churches have definitely changed to fit with modern times. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was younger, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd wear cute dresses and matching shoes and purses – the whole nine yards! I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too.  But now, things are different. They have a special mass just for teenagers, and it's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people coming straight from the beach! Even at the morning masses, where I always used to dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis now. It's definitely more relaxed.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other things going on in the church, I'm not really involved in the politics of it all.\n\nOh, and about those accusations against priests... I don't think allowing priests to get married would have stopped that. There are married men who become pedophiles too, so it's not about being married or not. I think it's more about the person themselves. \n\nSome religions allow their leaders to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" The main character was a minister, and he was married. So if someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion.",
            "I'm not really okay with how the Iraq War started. It felt like everyone was still shaken up by 9/11, and the government used that fear to justify going to war. They kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turns out that was all a lie. It makes me so angry that they tricked the American people like that.  \n\nEven Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious betrayal of the public trust. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration doesn't care about the Constitution at all. They've been trying to ignore it since 9/11.  I think they went into office wanting to go to war, and maybe even with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  \n\nIt's also suspicious that they wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause chaos and more deaths, but sending other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia in to try and fix things doesn't seem like a good solution either.  \n\nIt's a mess. The Iraqi government isn't working. The Prime Minister doesn't have much power, and people like Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, are now in Parliament. There are so many different groups fighting for control. It's hard to see a way out of this.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you how I feel about the war in Iraq. Honestly, I think it's kind of pointless at this point. I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? It feels like it was just a way for us to get back at Iraq because they were blamed for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're just staying there to build democracy and get access to their oil. But staying there is causing a lot of problems and making people angry.\n\nIt's a struggle because if we leave, they might be upset because things are messed up and they'll have to start over.  But if we stay, it'll take forever to create a democracy, and it might make them even more resentful.\n\nIt's a real dilemma. I don't know what the right answer is.\n\nI guess I feel like we should be helping them, but it's also a waste of resources. And honestly, it's making President Bush look bad, making people think of him like the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nIt's tough because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to come home safe, but it feels like we've already caused a lot of damage.\n\nThe people in Iraq have their own culture and beliefs, and it feels like we're trying to force them into something that isn't theirs. It's like we're trying to make them into a second United States, which probably wouldn't be good for them.\n\nI think this whole war is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really complicated.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal... I just don't feel it's right. It's like, the constitution says there should be a separation between church and state, and that's pretty clear, you know? Trying to make it legal, trying to force it, feels like going against what's already written down.\n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are picking sides, choosing one church's beliefs over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston.  But who are we to tell the churches what they can and can't say is wrong or right?\n\nSeparation of church and state is important, it's about letting people practice their religion freely.  Even if they try to make an amendment, it feels wrong. It's like they're trying to limit people instead of the government. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved at all. It seems like this guy pushing for the amendment is just trying to impose his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't help the economy or anything. Maybe it would even be good for society.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq...I don't think the government was totally straight with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to connect the Iraq War to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really linked that strongly.  But they played on everyone's feelings of anger after 9/11, and that's how the war started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one just because we're scared. It feels like the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War in a lot of ways, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made then.  \n\nA ton of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The government didn't seem prepared for what would happen after they removed Saddam Hussein's government – the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They basically took out the Iraqi government and tried to put in a democracy, just like they tried to do in Vietnam, pushing out communists and trying to impose democracy.  \n\nThe US government should have known that it would be a long, hard fight. It wasn't going to be a quick, clear victory, like some people hoped. It feels more like a loss, like Vietnam, because no matter how many people want the US to be there, there will always be people who resist.  It's tough to fight against a whole population, not just a formal army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up in a lot of ways. First, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. And if they had, they should have been more prepared for the consequences. They didn't plan for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government, and we're still there in 2006, with American soldiers still dying, and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a slow process, and I think the US government made it seem like it would be much easier.\n\nChanging a whole government and country is a huge deal, just look at our own history! It took a long time to become the democratic nation we are today, with lots of struggles and even civil war. It's not something that happens overnight. The US government made it sound simple, but it's not.\n\nAnd then there's the whole question of why we're in Iraq in the first place. If we're going to make a country democratic, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this for other countries too? I think it has to do with oil. It's always about money and resources.\n\nRemember when they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction? They never found any! But places like North Korea, where we know they have weapons of mass destruction, we're not going to war with them. So, I don't think the US government is being honest or thorough in their decisions.\n\nAll I can hope for is peace in Iraq soon. But honestly, I don't think it will come anytime soon.",
            "Hmm, let me tell you, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been. You know, it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it's a natural part of who someone is, not something they choose. It just feels wrong to take away people's rights because of something they can't control.  \n\nHonestly, it feels really unfair. I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  \n\nPolitics and the government shouldn't be involved in this at all. It's a personal matter, something between two people. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs, doing normal things.  \n\nIt's upsetting to see people like Bush trying to decide what marriage means. It's their personal lives, not his place to judge. \n\nIt seems like science is even proving that being gay is something you're born with, a natural part of who you are, not something you learn. It's about chemistry in the brain, not about growing up with siblings or parents.  \n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just go to Vegas and do it. No one even bats an eye. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal, front-page news. It shouldn't be like that. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone else is entitled to know about.",
            "Okay, so listen up.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can hear it!  As someone who works with people, I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nWhat you post online can totally change how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or even shootings, someone is going to take notice.  You can't just put that stuff out there and expect it to disappear. The internet is everywhere.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nSchools have to be careful because someone might see something scary online and tell them. They can't just ignore it, because what if something bad happens? They have to investigate.\n\nBut sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's real and what's not. Maybe it's just a prank gone wrong, like a sociology project. Or maybe it's something serious.  I know one time someone made a joke online that got them in big trouble.  It was something harmless at first, but because of the situation, it became really serious.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you don't want something out there, don't post it.  You can't control what people think, but you can control what you share. Schools may have to look at what's online if someone tells them about something concerning.  It's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared that information. \n\nIt's important for teachers and school officials to respect students' privacy. They shouldn't be snooping through their social media accounts. But if something dangerous is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war, it's been going on for way too long. I think at first, it had a good goal, to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But now, it feels like we've forgotten that reason. Maybe we're just fighting to show everyone how powerful we are. I wonder if the reasons we started were even good to begin with, with all the old problems between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein.  If the point was to help a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons mixed in, that wouldn't be right. This war has dragged on for ages, though. We made our point those first few months, that was enough.  But now it's been years, and it just seems pointless. If we wanted to give democracy to people under a bad leader, that's a good reason to fight. But it feels like our purpose has gotten messed up over time. We're still fighting like we need to win, even though I don't think that's the point anymore.  It's been long enough. Their government needs to figure things out on its own. We've been spending billions and billions, money that could be better used right here at home. We have problems with poverty, roads, schools, and healthcare. We should be taking care of those things first. It's just not right to keep sending money to a war we've lost sight of. We're even hurting our own people with this. They're getting killed in a war that doesn't make sense anymore.",
            "Someone was asking if it's okay that someone found something on MySpace and stopped something bad from happening. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, because if you put something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. On MySpace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.  Anything you put on the internet, lots of people will probably see it. So maybe it was good that someone saw it and could prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tricky though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time. And it wouldn't be fair to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for something specific? I don't know.\n\nIt does bother me that creepy people can see things about me on Facebook, even though I don't have MySpace. I saw a story on TV about a guy who got someone's screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in less than a minute and got them to meet him. I definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes IM me even though I don't recognize their screen names. It's scary because they know things about me, like my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, my friends. They can see lots of photos. I try to be careful about what I put up, but I also want to be able to connect with friends. It's a tough balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who's really looking at what.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned MySpace, which seemed strange to me. I don't know if it's a privacy issue, but I think it's weird that school officials can tell students they can't have MySpace.",
            "Hmm...this Iraq War thing...it's tough to talk about, you know? I feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon, saying I was against it from the start. But honestly, it just feels wrong to have been involved in the first place.  It seems like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for the people who made it happen. They don't want to admit they were wrong. \n\nSeriously, look at the polls: 75-80% of people worldwide think it was a mistake, even most of the US troops there. They want us out within the year.  It's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be a mess too.  It's like quicksand - we just can't seem to get out of it.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's just a clash of cultures.  The US and the Middle East are so different.  It's like trying to force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  Sure, Saddam was bad, but invading a country and expecting everything to be fine afterwards... that's just not how it works.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there anymore. The people who live there want us out, and they might just know what's best for their country.  If we ask them and they say leave, then at least it's not on us if things go wrong.  We can say we tried to help, but they decided not to accept it.\n\nMaybe that would make us look a little better, even if we'll never truly be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "Okay, so I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  \n\nIt's not just about women, though. I feel like it depends a lot on what kind of work you do. \n\nFor women, there's this invisible barrier, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  A lot of times, guys struggle with having a woman as their boss because of how society has always been.  So, a woman might be totally qualified for a promotion, but the board might not pick her because traditionally, women aren't seen as being in charge in business.\n\nAnd it's kinda the same for guys, too. Like, in fields like fashion or even being a stay-at-home parent, it's not super common to see men do those things. Society kind of looks down on it, thinking, \"Oh, you're the guy, you should be out working, making money!\" But maybe a guy really wants to be with his kids and help raise them, and his wife has the better job. It's a tough situation because what works for them might not fit society's expectations.\n\nAnd in fashion, guys who are straight sometimes get treated differently. I don't know if this makes sense, but I think it's because people assume guys into fashion have a certain type of lifestyle, so they might wonder if a straight guy really \"gets\" fashion the way a woman does.\n\nSo, it really depends on the field. I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society, but it's slow to change.  We've made progress, with women becoming CEOs and more accepted in business, and stay-at-home dads becoming more common.  People are starting to get it, but it takes time. Maybe we just need to keep showing people the good qualities of those who are stereotyped and not be too pushy about it. If we force it, people might resist.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just made it so it's not a crime anymore.\n\nThink of it like a parking ticket, you know? Instead of getting arrested and all that drama, you just get a citation. \n\nBut even though it's not a criminal offense, it can still mess with folks.  Like, if you get caught, it could still pop up during job interviews and stuff. It might not be as bad as a full-blown drug charge, but it's still something you gotta worry about.\n\nSome folks are worried about what this means for the future, too. Like, will it really change things?\n\nOn the other hand, it costs a ton of money to arrest and prosecute people for marijuana.  Think about all the court appearances, lawyers, and jail time.\n\nSome towns are struggling financially, and they're thinking, \"Hey, maybe we can save some money if we just decriminalize it.\"\n\nBut there are also places where folks are really against marijuana, even if it means saving money.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, is more open to it. They probably have more cash now to spend on good things like schools and helping the less fortunate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. You don't want marijuana to be everywhere, but you also don't want to waste money locking people up for it.\n\nPersonally, I think it's better than having people get in serious trouble over it.",
            "Hmmm...Catholics, right? I guess there are good things about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, which can be comforting. But sometimes, you know, it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't want to change.  They're super strict about going to church every week and doing things their way. It's like they judge people who don't follow every single rule perfectly. And they don't really accept people who aren't exactly like them, like people from other religions. \n\nMy parents are a good example. My mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church wouldn't let them get married because of my dad's religion.  It just seems hypocritical to preach about loving everyone but then not accept people who are different.\n\nI mean, maybe allowing priests to get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from doing bad stuff. You know, like the whole child abuse thing. It's a separate issue, like, even if they had wives, they might still do those things. People who hurt children, they're probably going to hurt children no matter what.",
            "Hmm... This whole thing about marriage is really confusing. I haven't figured out what I think yet.  It's hard to say who's right or wrong because it's such a tough topic. It's like a tightrope walk between separating religion and government, and figuring out what marriage really means without hurting anyone's feelings.  I don't know, maybe all marriages should just be treated as civil unions, no matter who's getting married. Like, the government shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not. Just two people coming together. It's like, if you're baptized, the government doesn't get involved, right? So why should they care about marriage?\n\nIf everyone could agree on a fair way to handle it, maybe they could make it a national law. But trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's crazy! It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to change the Constitution. It's just not that important.",
            "Ugh, this whole homosexuality thing is a tough one for me. I grew up Christian, so it's kinda like a gray area.  I've got lots of gay friends, you know?  I don't really agree with the lifestyle, but hey, I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a huge national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a call for the whole country.\n\nLike, think about it, some states are super liberal, others are more conservative.  The liberal states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you live there, you gotta respect their decision, right? You kinda chose to live there, knowing what their views are.\n\nLook, I just think everyone deserves the same chances, gay or straight. So, I think legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already said it, but I don't think Bush should be able to tell the whole country what to do about gay marriage. It should be up to each state to decide.  I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to control how things are run there. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth.  It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with it, not the president.",
            "Okay, so basically, Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right?  Anything you post there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So if school officials see something on there, it's not really a surprise. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut if they find something that could prevent a school shooting, I think that's totally okay.  Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then it's worth it.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy. \n\nBut if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, like a threat of violence, then I don't think it's wrong for them to look.\n\nThink about it:  parents trust schools to keep their kids safe. We all want to feel safe at school.  \n\nJust like we have drills for emergencies, checking Myspace could be another way to keep everyone safe.  It's like making sure the school is a secure place, just like after those awful shootings happened.",
            "You know, at first I was totally on board with the war. Nine Eleven hit me hard, personally. I wanted revenge, to make those guys pay for what they did here. Looking back, though, I think we were all so caught up in the emotion of it all that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a clear plan, and it just backfired.\n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. Honestly, I think those people are too busy fighting amongst themselves to worry about us.  It's like, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nNine Eleven really changed my feelings about that whole region. I just don't care what happens over there anymore. Sometimes I even wonder if they're truly human. They're always fighting, always causing chaos.\n\nWe went in blind, didn't know what to expect. War's different there, much more savage. They're not fighting for their country, they're fighting to push us out. Maybe that's what we should do, just leave.  \n\nI think we were just driven by anger and a thirst for revenge, not a clear strategy. President Bush probably felt pressured by the people, but I don't think declaring war on Iraq was the right move.\n\nSure, we couldn't just ignore what happened, but we should have had a better plan. There wasn't any unity, no clear purpose. We went in there hoping to create order, but it just made things worse.\n\nWe probably can't change those people anyway. They're stuck in their ways, and I don't think any amount of time will change that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there. It's just hurting us more than anything."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmmm...I think the Catholic Church needs to catch up with the times in some ways. \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things.  Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  It's okay to have strong beliefs, but some of their views seem stuck in the past.  \n\nIf they were a little more open-minded, they might not worry so much about losing people.  I've heard that lots of folks are turning away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that says it's always wrong.  Or if you support gay marriage, you might feel out of place in a church that doesn't.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have women priests or allow priests to get married.  It's like, everyone else has a job and a family life, so why not priests?  They claim priests are \"married\" to God, but I think it's possible to be devoted to God and have a family too.",
            "Hmm...so, about gay marriage, I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you choose, right? So, I feel like gay people shouldn't have to deal with being judged for who they are. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but honestly, it just seems wrong to me.  \n\nIt's like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It's just how we are, you know?  It's not like they made a choice to be that way.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not a legal or moral issue, really.  It's not like they did something wrong. It's just who they are. It's not right to make them feel like they're different or that they made the wrong choice.\n\nIt's just not their place to interfere in people's lives like that.",
            "You know, I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's just no strong reason against it. Many folks worry that same-sex couples will somehow threaten \"traditional\" families, but it's not like that at all. It's like comparing apples and oranges, they're different, but still part of the same fruit basket.  \n\nThere are tons of rights involved, like with taxes, healthcare, and all that.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be there for you in the hospital if you're sick. They can't even visit!  It's crazy because if you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and successful as straight ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.\n\nSometimes people get hung up on the religious aspects, but gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, just a legal marriage certificate from the government.  It's like separating church and state, you know? \n\nI don't get why some religions are so against it. It's like saying, \"Our religion says no to this, so it should be illegal for everyone.\" That's not fair! If you're allowing civil unions, why not full marriage? It's like segregation – treating people differently just because they're different.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how gay couples will raise kids, but studies show they're just as good at it as straight couples. It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.\n\nHonestly, the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about time we all had equal rights.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you, working at the hospital pharmacy this summer, you realize some things. Just because something's illegal, doesn't mean it's totally bad. I mean, should we just make everything illegal?  I don't think so.  \n\nI get it, making drugs available to everyone might be a problem.  But, for medical reasons? Sure, why not?\n\nThere are tons of drugs that are illegal but we use them in the pharmacy all the time.  Like, oxycontin, Vicodin, percocet...those are serious drugs, controlled substances, but they help people.  If we're going to deny the good that marijuana can do just because it's considered taboo, that doesn't make sense to me.  We should look at the benefits, you know?\n\nAlcohol's different, I guess, but even then, if you abuse it, it can cause problems. Marijuana, it's a bit tricky.  Maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just jump right in.  That way, people can learn to use it responsibly.\n\nIt's all about the image people have of marijuana. It's illegal, so they think it's bad, right? But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we could change how people see it, maybe they'd use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "You know, I think churches have definitely changed to fit with modern times. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was younger, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd wear cute dresses and matching shoes and purses – the whole nine yards! I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too.  But now, things are different. They have a special mass just for teenagers, and it's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people coming straight from the beach! Even at the morning masses, where I always used to dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis now. It's definitely more relaxed.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other things going on in the church, I'm not really involved in the politics of it all.\n\nOh, and about those accusations against priests... I don't think allowing priests to get married would have stopped that. There are married men who become pedophiles too, so it's not about being married or not. I think it's more about the person themselves. \n\nSome religions allow their leaders to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" The main character was a minister, and he was married. So if someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion.",
            "I'm not really okay with how the Iraq War started. It felt like everyone was still shaken up by 9/11, and the government used that fear to justify going to war. They kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turns out that was all a lie. It makes me so angry that they tricked the American people like that.  \n\nEven Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious betrayal of the public trust. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration doesn't care about the Constitution at all. They've been trying to ignore it since 9/11.  I think they went into office wanting to go to war, and maybe even with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  \n\nIt's also suspicious that they wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause chaos and more deaths, but sending other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia in to try and fix things doesn't seem like a good solution either.  \n\nIt's a mess. The Iraqi government isn't working. The Prime Minister doesn't have much power, and people like Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, are now in Parliament. There are so many different groups fighting for control. It's hard to see a way out of this.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you how I feel about the war in Iraq. Honestly, I think it's kind of pointless at this point. I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? It feels like it was just a way for us to get back at Iraq because they were blamed for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're just staying there to build democracy and get access to their oil. But staying there is causing a lot of problems and making people angry.\n\nIt's a struggle because if we leave, they might be upset because things are messed up and they'll have to start over.  But if we stay, it'll take forever to create a democracy, and it might make them even more resentful.\n\nIt's a real dilemma. I don't know what the right answer is.\n\nI guess I feel like we should be helping them, but it's also a waste of resources. And honestly, it's making President Bush look bad, making people think of him like the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nIt's tough because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to come home safe, but it feels like we've already caused a lot of damage.\n\nThe people in Iraq have their own culture and beliefs, and it feels like we're trying to force them into something that isn't theirs. It's like we're trying to make them into a second United States, which probably wouldn't be good for them.\n\nI think this whole war is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really complicated.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal... I just don't feel it's right. It's like, the constitution says there should be a separation between church and state, and that's pretty clear, you know? Trying to make it legal, trying to force it, feels like going against what's already written down.\n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are picking sides, choosing one church's beliefs over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston.  But who are we to tell the churches what they can and can't say is wrong or right?\n\nSeparation of church and state is important, it's about letting people practice their religion freely.  Even if they try to make an amendment, it feels wrong. It's like they're trying to limit people instead of the government. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved at all. It seems like this guy pushing for the amendment is just trying to impose his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't help the economy or anything. Maybe it would even be good for society.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq...I don't think the government was totally straight with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to connect the Iraq War to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really linked that strongly.  But they played on everyone's feelings of anger after 9/11, and that's how the war started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one just because we're scared. It feels like the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War in a lot of ways, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made then.  \n\nA ton of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The government didn't seem prepared for what would happen after they removed Saddam Hussein's government – the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They basically took out the Iraqi government and tried to put in a democracy, just like they tried to do in Vietnam, pushing out communists and trying to impose democracy.  \n\nThe US government should have known that it would be a long, hard fight. It wasn't going to be a quick, clear victory, like some people hoped. It feels more like a loss, like Vietnam, because no matter how many people want the US to be there, there will always be people who resist.  It's tough to fight against a whole population, not just a formal army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up in a lot of ways. First, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. And if they had, they should have been more prepared for the consequences. They didn't plan for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government, and we're still there in 2006, with American soldiers still dying, and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a slow process, and I think the US government made it seem like it would be much easier.\n\nChanging a whole government and country is a huge deal, just look at our own history! It took a long time to become the democratic nation we are today, with lots of struggles and even civil war. It's not something that happens overnight. The US government made it sound simple, but it's not.\n\nAnd then there's the whole question of why we're in Iraq in the first place. If we're going to make a country democratic, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this for other countries too? I think it has to do with oil. It's always about money and resources.\n\nRemember when they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction? They never found any! But places like North Korea, where we know they have weapons of mass destruction, we're not going to war with them. So, I don't think the US government is being honest or thorough in their decisions.\n\nAll I can hope for is peace in Iraq soon. But honestly, I don't think it will come anytime soon.",
            "Hmm, let me tell you, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been. You know, it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it's a natural part of who someone is, not something they choose. It just feels wrong to take away people's rights because of something they can't control.  \n\nHonestly, it feels really unfair. I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  \n\nPolitics and the government shouldn't be involved in this at all. It's a personal matter, something between two people. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs, doing normal things.  \n\nIt's upsetting to see people like Bush trying to decide what marriage means. It's their personal lives, not his place to judge. \n\nIt seems like science is even proving that being gay is something you're born with, a natural part of who you are, not something you learn. It's about chemistry in the brain, not about growing up with siblings or parents.  \n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just go to Vegas and do it. No one even bats an eye. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal, front-page news. It shouldn't be like that. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone else is entitled to know about.",
            "Okay, so listen up.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can hear it!  As someone who works with people, I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nWhat you post online can totally change how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or even shootings, someone is going to take notice.  You can't just put that stuff out there and expect it to disappear. The internet is everywhere.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nSchools have to be careful because someone might see something scary online and tell them. They can't just ignore it, because what if something bad happens? They have to investigate.\n\nBut sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's real and what's not. Maybe it's just a prank gone wrong, like a sociology project. Or maybe it's something serious.  I know one time someone made a joke online that got them in big trouble.  It was something harmless at first, but because of the situation, it became really serious.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you don't want something out there, don't post it.  You can't control what people think, but you can control what you share. Schools may have to look at what's online if someone tells them about something concerning.  It's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared that information. \n\nIt's important for teachers and school officials to respect students' privacy. They shouldn't be snooping through their social media accounts. But if something dangerous is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war, it's been going on for way too long. I think at first, it had a good goal, to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But now, it feels like we've forgotten that reason. Maybe we're just fighting to show everyone how powerful we are. I wonder if the reasons we started were even good to begin with, with all the old problems between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein.  If the point was to help a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons mixed in, that wouldn't be right. This war has dragged on for ages, though. We made our point those first few months, that was enough.  But now it's been years, and it just seems pointless. If we wanted to give democracy to people under a bad leader, that's a good reason to fight. But it feels like our purpose has gotten messed up over time. We're still fighting like we need to win, even though I don't think that's the point anymore.  It's been long enough. Their government needs to figure things out on its own. We've been spending billions and billions, money that could be better used right here at home. We have problems with poverty, roads, schools, and healthcare. We should be taking care of those things first. It's just not right to keep sending money to a war we've lost sight of. We're even hurting our own people with this. They're getting killed in a war that doesn't make sense anymore.",
            "Someone was asking if it's okay that someone found something on MySpace and stopped something bad from happening. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, because if you put something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. On MySpace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.  Anything you put on the internet, lots of people will probably see it. So maybe it was good that someone saw it and could prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tricky though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time. And it wouldn't be fair to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for something specific? I don't know.\n\nIt does bother me that creepy people can see things about me on Facebook, even though I don't have MySpace. I saw a story on TV about a guy who got someone's screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in less than a minute and got them to meet him. I definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes IM me even though I don't recognize their screen names. It's scary because they know things about me, like my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, my friends. They can see lots of photos. I try to be careful about what I put up, but I also want to be able to connect with friends. It's a tough balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who's really looking at what.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned MySpace, which seemed strange to me. I don't know if it's a privacy issue, but I think it's weird that school officials can tell students they can't have MySpace.",
            "Hmm...this Iraq War thing...it's tough to talk about, you know? I feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon, saying I was against it from the start. But honestly, it just feels wrong to have been involved in the first place.  It seems like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for the people who made it happen. They don't want to admit they were wrong. \n\nSeriously, look at the polls: 75-80% of people worldwide think it was a mistake, even most of the US troops there. They want us out within the year.  It's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be a mess too.  It's like quicksand - we just can't seem to get out of it.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's just a clash of cultures.  The US and the Middle East are so different.  It's like trying to force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  Sure, Saddam was bad, but invading a country and expecting everything to be fine afterwards... that's just not how it works.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there anymore. The people who live there want us out, and they might just know what's best for their country.  If we ask them and they say leave, then at least it's not on us if things go wrong.  We can say we tried to help, but they decided not to accept it.\n\nMaybe that would make us look a little better, even if we'll never truly be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "Okay, so I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  \n\nIt's not just about women, though. I feel like it depends a lot on what kind of work you do. \n\nFor women, there's this invisible barrier, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  A lot of times, guys struggle with having a woman as their boss because of how society has always been.  So, a woman might be totally qualified for a promotion, but the board might not pick her because traditionally, women aren't seen as being in charge in business.\n\nAnd it's kinda the same for guys, too. Like, in fields like fashion or even being a stay-at-home parent, it's not super common to see men do those things. Society kind of looks down on it, thinking, \"Oh, you're the guy, you should be out working, making money!\" But maybe a guy really wants to be with his kids and help raise them, and his wife has the better job. It's a tough situation because what works for them might not fit society's expectations.\n\nAnd in fashion, guys who are straight sometimes get treated differently. I don't know if this makes sense, but I think it's because people assume guys into fashion have a certain type of lifestyle, so they might wonder if a straight guy really \"gets\" fashion the way a woman does.\n\nSo, it really depends on the field. I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society, but it's slow to change.  We've made progress, with women becoming CEOs and more accepted in business, and stay-at-home dads becoming more common.  People are starting to get it, but it takes time. Maybe we just need to keep showing people the good qualities of those who are stereotyped and not be too pushy about it. If we force it, people might resist.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just made it so it's not a crime anymore.\n\nThink of it like a parking ticket, you know? Instead of getting arrested and all that drama, you just get a citation. \n\nBut even though it's not a criminal offense, it can still mess with folks.  Like, if you get caught, it could still pop up during job interviews and stuff. It might not be as bad as a full-blown drug charge, but it's still something you gotta worry about.\n\nSome folks are worried about what this means for the future, too. Like, will it really change things?\n\nOn the other hand, it costs a ton of money to arrest and prosecute people for marijuana.  Think about all the court appearances, lawyers, and jail time.\n\nSome towns are struggling financially, and they're thinking, \"Hey, maybe we can save some money if we just decriminalize it.\"\n\nBut there are also places where folks are really against marijuana, even if it means saving money.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, is more open to it. They probably have more cash now to spend on good things like schools and helping the less fortunate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. You don't want marijuana to be everywhere, but you also don't want to waste money locking people up for it.\n\nPersonally, I think it's better than having people get in serious trouble over it.",
            "Hmmm...Catholics, right? I guess there are good things about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, which can be comforting. But sometimes, you know, it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't want to change.  They're super strict about going to church every week and doing things their way. It's like they judge people who don't follow every single rule perfectly. And they don't really accept people who aren't exactly like them, like people from other religions. \n\nMy parents are a good example. My mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church wouldn't let them get married because of my dad's religion.  It just seems hypocritical to preach about loving everyone but then not accept people who are different.\n\nI mean, maybe allowing priests to get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from doing bad stuff. You know, like the whole child abuse thing. It's a separate issue, like, even if they had wives, they might still do those things. People who hurt children, they're probably going to hurt children no matter what.",
            "Hmm... This whole thing about marriage is really confusing. I haven't figured out what I think yet.  It's hard to say who's right or wrong because it's such a tough topic. It's like a tightrope walk between separating religion and government, and figuring out what marriage really means without hurting anyone's feelings.  I don't know, maybe all marriages should just be treated as civil unions, no matter who's getting married. Like, the government shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not. Just two people coming together. It's like, if you're baptized, the government doesn't get involved, right? So why should they care about marriage?\n\nIf everyone could agree on a fair way to handle it, maybe they could make it a national law. But trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's crazy! It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to change the Constitution. It's just not that important.",
            "Ugh, this whole homosexuality thing is a tough one for me. I grew up Christian, so it's kinda like a gray area.  I've got lots of gay friends, you know?  I don't really agree with the lifestyle, but hey, I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a huge national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a call for the whole country.\n\nLike, think about it, some states are super liberal, others are more conservative.  The liberal states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you live there, you gotta respect their decision, right? You kinda chose to live there, knowing what their views are.\n\nLook, I just think everyone deserves the same chances, gay or straight. So, I think legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already said it, but I don't think Bush should be able to tell the whole country what to do about gay marriage. It should be up to each state to decide.  I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to control how things are run there. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth.  It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with it, not the president.",
            "Okay, so basically, Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right?  Anything you post there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So if school officials see something on there, it's not really a surprise. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut if they find something that could prevent a school shooting, I think that's totally okay.  Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then it's worth it.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy. \n\nBut if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, like a threat of violence, then I don't think it's wrong for them to look.\n\nThink about it:  parents trust schools to keep their kids safe. We all want to feel safe at school.  \n\nJust like we have drills for emergencies, checking Myspace could be another way to keep everyone safe.  It's like making sure the school is a secure place, just like after those awful shootings happened.",
            "You know, at first I was totally on board with the war. Nine Eleven hit me hard, personally. I wanted revenge, to make those guys pay for what they did here. Looking back, though, I think we were all so caught up in the emotion of it all that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a clear plan, and it just backfired.\n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. Honestly, I think those people are too busy fighting amongst themselves to worry about us.  It's like, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nNine Eleven really changed my feelings about that whole region. I just don't care what happens over there anymore. Sometimes I even wonder if they're truly human. They're always fighting, always causing chaos.\n\nWe went in blind, didn't know what to expect. War's different there, much more savage. They're not fighting for their country, they're fighting to push us out. Maybe that's what we should do, just leave.  \n\nI think we were just driven by anger and a thirst for revenge, not a clear strategy. President Bush probably felt pressured by the people, but I don't think declaring war on Iraq was the right move.\n\nSure, we couldn't just ignore what happened, but we should have had a better plan. There wasn't any unity, no clear purpose. We went in there hoping to create order, but it just made things worse.\n\nWe probably can't change those people anyway. They're stuck in their ways, and I don't think any amount of time will change that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there. It's just hurting us more than anything."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmmm...I think the Catholic Church needs to catch up with the times in some ways. \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things.  Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  It's okay to have strong beliefs, but some of their views seem stuck in the past.  \n\nIf they were a little more open-minded, they might not worry so much about losing people.  I've heard that lots of folks are turning away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that says it's always wrong.  Or if you support gay marriage, you might feel out of place in a church that doesn't.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have women priests or allow priests to get married.  It's like, everyone else has a job and a family life, so why not priests?  They claim priests are \"married\" to God, but I think it's possible to be devoted to God and have a family too.",
            "Hmm...so, about gay marriage, I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you choose, right? So, I feel like gay people shouldn't have to deal with being judged for who they are. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but honestly, it just seems wrong to me.  \n\nIt's like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It's just how we are, you know?  It's not like they made a choice to be that way.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not a legal or moral issue, really.  It's not like they did something wrong. It's just who they are. It's not right to make them feel like they're different or that they made the wrong choice.\n\nIt's just not their place to interfere in people's lives like that.",
            "You know, I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's just no strong reason against it. Many folks worry that same-sex couples will somehow threaten \"traditional\" families, but it's not like that at all. It's like comparing apples and oranges, they're different, but still part of the same fruit basket.  \n\nThere are tons of rights involved, like with taxes, healthcare, and all that.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be there for you in the hospital if you're sick. They can't even visit!  It's crazy because if you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and successful as straight ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.\n\nSometimes people get hung up on the religious aspects, but gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, just a legal marriage certificate from the government.  It's like separating church and state, you know? \n\nI don't get why some religions are so against it. It's like saying, \"Our religion says no to this, so it should be illegal for everyone.\" That's not fair! If you're allowing civil unions, why not full marriage? It's like segregation – treating people differently just because they're different.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how gay couples will raise kids, but studies show they're just as good at it as straight couples. It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.\n\nHonestly, the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about time we all had equal rights.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you, working at the hospital pharmacy this summer, you realize some things. Just because something's illegal, doesn't mean it's totally bad. I mean, should we just make everything illegal?  I don't think so.  \n\nI get it, making drugs available to everyone might be a problem.  But, for medical reasons? Sure, why not?\n\nThere are tons of drugs that are illegal but we use them in the pharmacy all the time.  Like, oxycontin, Vicodin, percocet...those are serious drugs, controlled substances, but they help people.  If we're going to deny the good that marijuana can do just because it's considered taboo, that doesn't make sense to me.  We should look at the benefits, you know?\n\nAlcohol's different, I guess, but even then, if you abuse it, it can cause problems. Marijuana, it's a bit tricky.  Maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just jump right in.  That way, people can learn to use it responsibly.\n\nIt's all about the image people have of marijuana. It's illegal, so they think it's bad, right? But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we could change how people see it, maybe they'd use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "You know, I think churches have definitely changed to fit with modern times. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was younger, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd wear cute dresses and matching shoes and purses – the whole nine yards! I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too.  But now, things are different. They have a special mass just for teenagers, and it's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people coming straight from the beach! Even at the morning masses, where I always used to dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis now. It's definitely more relaxed.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other things going on in the church, I'm not really involved in the politics of it all.\n\nOh, and about those accusations against priests... I don't think allowing priests to get married would have stopped that. There are married men who become pedophiles too, so it's not about being married or not. I think it's more about the person themselves. \n\nSome religions allow their leaders to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" The main character was a minister, and he was married. So if someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion.",
            "I'm not really okay with how the Iraq War started. It felt like everyone was still shaken up by 9/11, and the government used that fear to justify going to war. They kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turns out that was all a lie. It makes me so angry that they tricked the American people like that.  \n\nEven Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious betrayal of the public trust. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration doesn't care about the Constitution at all. They've been trying to ignore it since 9/11.  I think they went into office wanting to go to war, and maybe even with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  \n\nIt's also suspicious that they wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause chaos and more deaths, but sending other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia in to try and fix things doesn't seem like a good solution either.  \n\nIt's a mess. The Iraqi government isn't working. The Prime Minister doesn't have much power, and people like Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, are now in Parliament. There are so many different groups fighting for control. It's hard to see a way out of this.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you how I feel about the war in Iraq. Honestly, I think it's kind of pointless at this point. I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? It feels like it was just a way for us to get back at Iraq because they were blamed for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're just staying there to build democracy and get access to their oil. But staying there is causing a lot of problems and making people angry.\n\nIt's a struggle because if we leave, they might be upset because things are messed up and they'll have to start over.  But if we stay, it'll take forever to create a democracy, and it might make them even more resentful.\n\nIt's a real dilemma. I don't know what the right answer is.\n\nI guess I feel like we should be helping them, but it's also a waste of resources. And honestly, it's making President Bush look bad, making people think of him like the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nIt's tough because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to come home safe, but it feels like we've already caused a lot of damage.\n\nThe people in Iraq have their own culture and beliefs, and it feels like we're trying to force them into something that isn't theirs. It's like we're trying to make them into a second United States, which probably wouldn't be good for them.\n\nI think this whole war is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really complicated.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal... I just don't feel it's right. It's like, the constitution says there should be a separation between church and state, and that's pretty clear, you know? Trying to make it legal, trying to force it, feels like going against what's already written down.\n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are picking sides, choosing one church's beliefs over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston.  But who are we to tell the churches what they can and can't say is wrong or right?\n\nSeparation of church and state is important, it's about letting people practice their religion freely.  Even if they try to make an amendment, it feels wrong. It's like they're trying to limit people instead of the government. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved at all. It seems like this guy pushing for the amendment is just trying to impose his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't help the economy or anything. Maybe it would even be good for society.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq...I don't think the government was totally straight with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to connect the Iraq War to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really linked that strongly.  But they played on everyone's feelings of anger after 9/11, and that's how the war started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one just because we're scared. It feels like the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War in a lot of ways, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made then.  \n\nA ton of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The government didn't seem prepared for what would happen after they removed Saddam Hussein's government – the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They basically took out the Iraqi government and tried to put in a democracy, just like they tried to do in Vietnam, pushing out communists and trying to impose democracy.  \n\nThe US government should have known that it would be a long, hard fight. It wasn't going to be a quick, clear victory, like some people hoped. It feels more like a loss, like Vietnam, because no matter how many people want the US to be there, there will always be people who resist.  It's tough to fight against a whole population, not just a formal army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up in a lot of ways. First, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. And if they had, they should have been more prepared for the consequences. They didn't plan for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government, and we're still there in 2006, with American soldiers still dying, and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a slow process, and I think the US government made it seem like it would be much easier.\n\nChanging a whole government and country is a huge deal, just look at our own history! It took a long time to become the democratic nation we are today, with lots of struggles and even civil war. It's not something that happens overnight. The US government made it sound simple, but it's not.\n\nAnd then there's the whole question of why we're in Iraq in the first place. If we're going to make a country democratic, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this for other countries too? I think it has to do with oil. It's always about money and resources.\n\nRemember when they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction? They never found any! But places like North Korea, where we know they have weapons of mass destruction, we're not going to war with them. So, I don't think the US government is being honest or thorough in their decisions.\n\nAll I can hope for is peace in Iraq soon. But honestly, I don't think it will come anytime soon.",
            "Hmm, let me tell you, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been. You know, it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it's a natural part of who someone is, not something they choose. It just feels wrong to take away people's rights because of something they can't control.  \n\nHonestly, it feels really unfair. I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  \n\nPolitics and the government shouldn't be involved in this at all. It's a personal matter, something between two people. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs, doing normal things.  \n\nIt's upsetting to see people like Bush trying to decide what marriage means. It's their personal lives, not his place to judge. \n\nIt seems like science is even proving that being gay is something you're born with, a natural part of who you are, not something you learn. It's about chemistry in the brain, not about growing up with siblings or parents.  \n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just go to Vegas and do it. No one even bats an eye. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal, front-page news. It shouldn't be like that. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone else is entitled to know about.",
            "Okay, so listen up.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can hear it!  As someone who works with people, I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nWhat you post online can totally change how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or even shootings, someone is going to take notice.  You can't just put that stuff out there and expect it to disappear. The internet is everywhere.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nSchools have to be careful because someone might see something scary online and tell them. They can't just ignore it, because what if something bad happens? They have to investigate.\n\nBut sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's real and what's not. Maybe it's just a prank gone wrong, like a sociology project. Or maybe it's something serious.  I know one time someone made a joke online that got them in big trouble.  It was something harmless at first, but because of the situation, it became really serious.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you don't want something out there, don't post it.  You can't control what people think, but you can control what you share. Schools may have to look at what's online if someone tells them about something concerning.  It's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared that information. \n\nIt's important for teachers and school officials to respect students' privacy. They shouldn't be snooping through their social media accounts. But if something dangerous is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war, it's been going on for way too long. I think at first, it had a good goal, to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But now, it feels like we've forgotten that reason. Maybe we're just fighting to show everyone how powerful we are. I wonder if the reasons we started were even good to begin with, with all the old problems between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein.  If the point was to help a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons mixed in, that wouldn't be right. This war has dragged on for ages, though. We made our point those first few months, that was enough.  But now it's been years, and it just seems pointless. If we wanted to give democracy to people under a bad leader, that's a good reason to fight. But it feels like our purpose has gotten messed up over time. We're still fighting like we need to win, even though I don't think that's the point anymore.  It's been long enough. Their government needs to figure things out on its own. We've been spending billions and billions, money that could be better used right here at home. We have problems with poverty, roads, schools, and healthcare. We should be taking care of those things first. It's just not right to keep sending money to a war we've lost sight of. We're even hurting our own people with this. They're getting killed in a war that doesn't make sense anymore.",
            "Someone was asking if it's okay that someone found something on MySpace and stopped something bad from happening. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, because if you put something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. On MySpace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.  Anything you put on the internet, lots of people will probably see it. So maybe it was good that someone saw it and could prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tricky though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time. And it wouldn't be fair to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for something specific? I don't know.\n\nIt does bother me that creepy people can see things about me on Facebook, even though I don't have MySpace. I saw a story on TV about a guy who got someone's screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in less than a minute and got them to meet him. I definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes IM me even though I don't recognize their screen names. It's scary because they know things about me, like my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, my friends. They can see lots of photos. I try to be careful about what I put up, but I also want to be able to connect with friends. It's a tough balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who's really looking at what.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned MySpace, which seemed strange to me. I don't know if it's a privacy issue, but I think it's weird that school officials can tell students they can't have MySpace.",
            "Hmm...this Iraq War thing...it's tough to talk about, you know? I feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon, saying I was against it from the start. But honestly, it just feels wrong to have been involved in the first place.  It seems like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for the people who made it happen. They don't want to admit they were wrong. \n\nSeriously, look at the polls: 75-80% of people worldwide think it was a mistake, even most of the US troops there. They want us out within the year.  It's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be a mess too.  It's like quicksand - we just can't seem to get out of it.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's just a clash of cultures.  The US and the Middle East are so different.  It's like trying to force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  Sure, Saddam was bad, but invading a country and expecting everything to be fine afterwards... that's just not how it works.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there anymore. The people who live there want us out, and they might just know what's best for their country.  If we ask them and they say leave, then at least it's not on us if things go wrong.  We can say we tried to help, but they decided not to accept it.\n\nMaybe that would make us look a little better, even if we'll never truly be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "Okay, so I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  \n\nIt's not just about women, though. I feel like it depends a lot on what kind of work you do. \n\nFor women, there's this invisible barrier, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  A lot of times, guys struggle with having a woman as their boss because of how society has always been.  So, a woman might be totally qualified for a promotion, but the board might not pick her because traditionally, women aren't seen as being in charge in business.\n\nAnd it's kinda the same for guys, too. Like, in fields like fashion or even being a stay-at-home parent, it's not super common to see men do those things. Society kind of looks down on it, thinking, \"Oh, you're the guy, you should be out working, making money!\" But maybe a guy really wants to be with his kids and help raise them, and his wife has the better job. It's a tough situation because what works for them might not fit society's expectations.\n\nAnd in fashion, guys who are straight sometimes get treated differently. I don't know if this makes sense, but I think it's because people assume guys into fashion have a certain type of lifestyle, so they might wonder if a straight guy really \"gets\" fashion the way a woman does.\n\nSo, it really depends on the field. I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society, but it's slow to change.  We've made progress, with women becoming CEOs and more accepted in business, and stay-at-home dads becoming more common.  People are starting to get it, but it takes time. Maybe we just need to keep showing people the good qualities of those who are stereotyped and not be too pushy about it. If we force it, people might resist.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just made it so it's not a crime anymore.\n\nThink of it like a parking ticket, you know? Instead of getting arrested and all that drama, you just get a citation. \n\nBut even though it's not a criminal offense, it can still mess with folks.  Like, if you get caught, it could still pop up during job interviews and stuff. It might not be as bad as a full-blown drug charge, but it's still something you gotta worry about.\n\nSome folks are worried about what this means for the future, too. Like, will it really change things?\n\nOn the other hand, it costs a ton of money to arrest and prosecute people for marijuana.  Think about all the court appearances, lawyers, and jail time.\n\nSome towns are struggling financially, and they're thinking, \"Hey, maybe we can save some money if we just decriminalize it.\"\n\nBut there are also places where folks are really against marijuana, even if it means saving money.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, is more open to it. They probably have more cash now to spend on good things like schools and helping the less fortunate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. You don't want marijuana to be everywhere, but you also don't want to waste money locking people up for it.\n\nPersonally, I think it's better than having people get in serious trouble over it.",
            "Hmmm...Catholics, right? I guess there are good things about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, which can be comforting. But sometimes, you know, it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't want to change.  They're super strict about going to church every week and doing things their way. It's like they judge people who don't follow every single rule perfectly. And they don't really accept people who aren't exactly like them, like people from other religions. \n\nMy parents are a good example. My mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church wouldn't let them get married because of my dad's religion.  It just seems hypocritical to preach about loving everyone but then not accept people who are different.\n\nI mean, maybe allowing priests to get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from doing bad stuff. You know, like the whole child abuse thing. It's a separate issue, like, even if they had wives, they might still do those things. People who hurt children, they're probably going to hurt children no matter what.",
            "Hmm... This whole thing about marriage is really confusing. I haven't figured out what I think yet.  It's hard to say who's right or wrong because it's such a tough topic. It's like a tightrope walk between separating religion and government, and figuring out what marriage really means without hurting anyone's feelings.  I don't know, maybe all marriages should just be treated as civil unions, no matter who's getting married. Like, the government shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not. Just two people coming together. It's like, if you're baptized, the government doesn't get involved, right? So why should they care about marriage?\n\nIf everyone could agree on a fair way to handle it, maybe they could make it a national law. But trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's crazy! It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to change the Constitution. It's just not that important.",
            "Ugh, this whole homosexuality thing is a tough one for me. I grew up Christian, so it's kinda like a gray area.  I've got lots of gay friends, you know?  I don't really agree with the lifestyle, but hey, I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a huge national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a call for the whole country.\n\nLike, think about it, some states are super liberal, others are more conservative.  The liberal states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you live there, you gotta respect their decision, right? You kinda chose to live there, knowing what their views are.\n\nLook, I just think everyone deserves the same chances, gay or straight. So, I think legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already said it, but I don't think Bush should be able to tell the whole country what to do about gay marriage. It should be up to each state to decide.  I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to control how things are run there. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth.  It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with it, not the president.",
            "Okay, so basically, Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right?  Anything you post there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So if school officials see something on there, it's not really a surprise. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut if they find something that could prevent a school shooting, I think that's totally okay.  Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then it's worth it.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy. \n\nBut if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, like a threat of violence, then I don't think it's wrong for them to look.\n\nThink about it:  parents trust schools to keep their kids safe. We all want to feel safe at school.  \n\nJust like we have drills for emergencies, checking Myspace could be another way to keep everyone safe.  It's like making sure the school is a secure place, just like after those awful shootings happened.",
            "You know, at first I was totally on board with the war. Nine Eleven hit me hard, personally. I wanted revenge, to make those guys pay for what they did here. Looking back, though, I think we were all so caught up in the emotion of it all that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a clear plan, and it just backfired.\n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. Honestly, I think those people are too busy fighting amongst themselves to worry about us.  It's like, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nNine Eleven really changed my feelings about that whole region. I just don't care what happens over there anymore. Sometimes I even wonder if they're truly human. They're always fighting, always causing chaos.\n\nWe went in blind, didn't know what to expect. War's different there, much more savage. They're not fighting for their country, they're fighting to push us out. Maybe that's what we should do, just leave.  \n\nI think we were just driven by anger and a thirst for revenge, not a clear strategy. President Bush probably felt pressured by the people, but I don't think declaring war on Iraq was the right move.\n\nSure, we couldn't just ignore what happened, but we should have had a better plan. There wasn't any unity, no clear purpose. We went in there hoping to create order, but it just made things worse.\n\nWe probably can't change those people anyway. They're stuck in their ways, and I don't think any amount of time will change that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there. It's just hurting us more than anything."
