            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmm, I think the Catholic Church could use a little update, you know?  People are saying it's losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things. Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that they have strong beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past. If they were a bit more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't be worried about people leaving.  I've heard folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these issues.  They just don't see eye to eye.  For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might feel uncomfortable being part of a group that says it's completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not feel welcome in a place that opposes it. Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or priests who are married.  But who knows if that would have stopped the recent scandals?  It's hard to say for sure. Maybe they would have done it anyway.  It's just weird that they expect priests to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.  It seems unfair.",
            "Mmm, okay. See, personally, I'm totally cool with gay people getting married.  I mean, whether someone is born that way or, you know, whatever, I just don't think it's something you choose, right? So, I don't think we should blame people for how they feel about who they love. It just seems wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really spent a lot of time thinking about it, but yeah, I definitely think it's wrong to say that.\n\nIt's kind of like, you know, I was born straight, and some people are born gay. It doesn't seem like a choice you make. They shouldn't have to feel bad about who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to treat them differently. Honestly, I don't think the government should get involved. It's not really a legal issue, or even a big moral issue. I don't think it's fair to put them on display like they made a mistake or something.\n\nSo, I don't think the government should have a say in it.\n\nIt's a bit tricky, you know?\n\n(laughs)  \n\nOkay, well, I just don't think the government should get involved because it's not like it affects our country's safety or anything. It's not like a moral issue. It just seems like they're overstepping.  They shouldn't be telling people how to live their lives. It's just who they are, you know? And they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "So, I think gay marriage should be totally legal, you know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are bad news for traditional families, but it's just not the same thing at all. It's like two sides of the same coin – different but connected.  Plus, there are tons of rights that come with marriage, like healthcare and property stuff. Imagine if your partner couldn't be with you in the hospital because they're not officially family. That's messed up, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same stuff that makes relationships work. They're just in love, just like everyone else. It's all about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nWhat really bugs me is the whole church and state thing. Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal marriage certificate from the government. If the government isn't getting involved in religion, then what's the big deal? \n\nIt's like saying no to civil unions but yes to marriage. That's just unfair. It's like segregation – separate but not equal.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and community stuff, but honestly, it's all about individual families, not just being gay.  Gay parents can be just as good as straight parents.  And those kids deserve the same love and support as any other kid.\n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It should be a right for everyone.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and you know, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Like, I think making it available to everyone, nah, not a good idea. But for medicine, I'm all for it.  Just 'cause it's against the law doesn't mean it can't be helpful, right?\n\nI mean, think about it, pharmacies use all kinds of drugs that are illegal, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet - those are serious stuff, but they're super useful for people.  If we can't see the good in marijuana just because it's got a bad reputation, that's not right. We gotta be open to its benefits.\n\nIt's different from alcohol, though.  Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and marijuana can too, but I think the key is to approach it slowly. Making it legal all at once might lead to problems, but if we start by getting rid of the stigma, maybe people will use it responsibly.\n\nPeople think marijuana is this terrible drug just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine. It's not that harmful. If we change how people see it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Hmm...the church, it's changed a lot since I was a little girl. It's not as strict anymore. Back then, I was always going to Sunday mass, all dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes and purses. It was every Sunday, you know, even when I went to private school. I'd see all my friends there on the weekends. \n\nBut now, things are different. They have this special mass for teenagers, just thirty minutes long, and people dress super casual. Even in the summer, some come straight from the beach! Families are always rushing in late. It's a lot more relaxed even at the morning masses.  I used to get all dressed up for those, but now people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's the church I know now. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but yeah, that's it.",
            "(laughs) \nYou know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still really shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration kept saying the war was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction – which, by the way, turned out to be completely untrue. \nThat really rubs me the wrong way. Honestly, the whole Iraq war just makes me furious. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, after giving that big presentation at the UN, has said he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious abuse of power – it's practically grounds for impeachment.  \nThey just seem to have no respect for the Constitution and have been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. They came into office with a plan to go to war, it seems like.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – who basically said that in his book after they kicked him out. It felt like Bush Jr. had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably also wanted to secure our energy supply by controlling the region. That's a pretty shady way to go about things.\n\nHonestly, it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would be messy, though. There's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and even more people would die.  \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to step in and restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It'll probably create more problems down the road because it undermines Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting recently, now has a bunch of seats in Parliament.  There are all these different groups fighting for power, and it's just creating a lot of chaos.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting too graphic.",
            "Ugh, this whole thing about the war in Iraq is such a mess. To be honest, I don’t even know where to begin. It feels pointless because it wasn’t officially declared a war, you know? It just seems like a way for us to get back at them for 9/11, like they were the only ones who could have possibly done it.\n\nHonestly, I’m not really into keeping up with all the details of the war. But I get the feeling we’re just staying there to try and build a democracy that’s more like the U.S. and to get their oil.  \n\nThe problem is, it’s making everyone upset, both there and here.  It’s like, if we stay, we’ll try to force democracy on them, but that takes forever. And if we leave, they’ll be angry because they’ll feel like we messed everything up and they have to start over. \n\nIt’s so complicated. It feels like there’s no good answer. \n\nI guess maybe it’s better to stay and help them, but it’s also a waste of resources. And it’s making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation. \n\nIt’s hard because I know families who have loved ones over there, and I want them to be safe. But then there are all these Iraqi families who have lost everything because of the fighting. It’s heartbreaking.\n\nIt’s like trying to change their culture to be more like ours, but that might make things even worse. It could make them hate us more.\n\nThis whole thing is just going to drag on and on. Ugh.",
            "Okay, so, I just don't think it's right for the government to get involved in making this legal or illegal. Like, the Constitution clearly says there should be separation of church and state, right? So trying to force a law on this would go against that.  It's like picking one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it's not the government's place to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important to religious freedom in America. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, that would be totally wrong. It would be one of the few amendments that limits people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI definitely don't think the government should be involved at all.  This guy pushing for an amendment is just trying to push his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government. There's no good reason for an amendment except for his personal views. I don't see how it would hurt the economy or anything – maybe even help!",
            "Okay, so let me tell you about this whole Iraq war thing.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th attacks, but really, they weren't that connected. The government made it seem like they were, though, using everyone's anger and fear from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made there.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't really prepared for what would happen after.  They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt, or how hard it would be to rebuild. It's like what they tried to do in Vietnam - pushing out Communists and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut the US government should have known it wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and it's not always a clear victory.  Vietnam was a loss, even if some people supported us. It's hard to win when you're fighting the entire population, not a regular army.\n\nSo, I think the government made a huge mistake going into this war. Even if you decide to go to war, you need to be prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government, and now we're still there years later.  \n\nThey made it seem like it would be a quick and successful mission, but that's just not how it works. Building a new government takes time and effort, just like it did in our own country.  It's not a simple fix.\n\nIt's really tough because we've been there for so long now. How can we just abandon these people after we took away their government and way of life?  But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, it seems like this whole thing might be about oil. We're getting our oil from there, after all. It's all about money and resources. We were also told Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though we know they have weapons.  \n\nI don't think the US government is being honest with us about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure it will.",
            "Hmm... let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage. Always have been. It's something deeply personal, don't you think? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just a choice. It wouldn't be fair to take away someone's rights just because they're born a certain way, right? That seems kind of cruel.\n\nI've always been on the side of equality for everyone. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's about love and commitment, things that happen at home, in families.\n\nLike, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples. They're not married, of course, because the law doesn't allow it. But they live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, going about their day. Why should it matter?\n\nIt's like Bush trying to play God and decide what marriage means. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nYou know, I've read a lot about how there might be a chemical difference in the brains of gay people. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose. Like, maybe having lots of sisters and no brothers doesn't make you gay, right?\n\nExcept for the obvious reasons, it's kind of unfair. If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas and no one would even know. But if two gay people want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It's like it should be a private matter, not something everyone else needs to know about. It's their relationship, not the government's business.",

It's the same online.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's for everyone.\n\nSchools have to act when they hear something concerning, even if it's just a rumor. They can't just ignore it and hope for the best.  What if something bad happens? They'd regret not taking action.  \n\nOf course, not everything online is serious. Sometimes people joke around, but it's tricky to tell the difference.  It's like that time we had at school where a harmless experiment went wrong and everyone panicked.  But sometimes, those online posts can be really serious, too. \n\nThere was this one case where someone overheard a conversation at school, and they reported it.  When they looked at the person's Facebook, they found some things that seemed harmless at first but became really worrying given the situation.\n\nSo, basically, once you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see.  Think before you post!  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online.  You can't control how people interpret it, but you can control what you share.",
            "This war feels like it's dragged on way too long. I get that the starting point had good intentions – helping another country get democracy. But I feel like we've forgotten that original goal. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove how powerful we are.  Plus, I think there were some questionable reasons for starting the war in the first place, like maybe old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  \n\nIf the goal was truly to give democracy to a country without fair politics, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, it wouldn't be fair.  \n\nI think we made our point in the early days of the war. That was a statement in itself. But the fact that it's been going on for years now just seems excessive.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that's a noble reason to fight. But I think our purpose has become muddled over time. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to win a decisive victory.\n\nThis war has lasted long enough. It's time for their government and people to take charge. We've been spending billions of dollars, draining our own economy, when we have problems here at home like poverty and crumbling infrastructure that need attention. That money could be better spent on improving our own lives.\n\nWe can't be in a constant state of war. There are so many other important things we need to focus on, like education, healthcare, and fixing our roads. It's heartbreaking to see money being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost sight of.",
            "Let me ask something, can you explain how this was stopped?  Someone looked online and saw something, right? Okay, I don't think that's bad. On sites like Myspace, if you put something online, anyone can see it.  I know on Myspace you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you've chosen to be friends with them, so they can see it. So, whenever you put things online, you have to understand that lots of people will see it. If someone saw something and could stop something bad from happening, I think that’s good.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day.  It would feel discriminatory to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job to just look at people's profiles. I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. It makes me uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a news story about a man who showed how easy it is to find information about people online. He found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet him. I wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they know my interests, what I look like, when I'm in class, and who my friends are. They can see lots of photos. I try to limit what I share, but it's hard because Facebook is for connecting with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who is looking at your profile.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace, and I thought that was strange. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I don't know if it's really a privacy issue, but I don't know how they have the right to tell people what they can and can't do. That's all I can think of.",
            "Hmm, you know... This whole Iraq War thing, it's a tough one for me. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, like everyone else who's suddenly against it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not like my opinion really matters now.  It's just... everyone knows it was a bad idea, except, well, the people in charge who don't want to admit they messed up.  \n\nSeriously, look at the polls! Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the whole world, people are saying it was a mistake.  Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the US troops over there, they all think we should get out. \n\nFrom the beginning, it was a disaster. And now pulling out? That's a disaster too.  The Middle East is just so complicated. It's like there's this huge gap between our way of life and theirs.  We can't just force democracy on them like it's some magic solution.  I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt. But invading a country and making it a total mess?  That's not the answer.\n\nI just don't get why we're still there. What's the point? I haven't heard any good reasons for staying. Sure, they might have some ideas, but I don't buy it.\n\nIf we're going to leave, let's just do it.  Maybe a year, maybe a little longer, but let's get out.  The Iraqi people are telling us to leave. They're the ones we're trying to help, right? Maybe they know best. \n\nAt least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" we can't be blamed if things go south. We'll be able to say, \"Hey, you asked us to leave.\"",
            "You know, I really think gender bias is still a thing in the United States.  It's not just women who face it, though. It seems to depend on what field you're in.  \n\nOverall, I feel like women have a tougher time because of this invisible barrier, this \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, a lot of people struggle with the idea of working under a woman. Society has been this way for so long, you know?  \n\nSo, women often see a job they're totally qualified for, but maybe the board won't promote them because historically, women aren't usually in leadership roles in business. \n\nThe same goes for men in certain fields, like parenting at home. It's uncommon to see a dad stay home while his wife works. People often judge that, thinking \"You're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  It can be tough on these dads when maybe they've always dreamed of being at home with their kids, and their wife is happy with her job.  \n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Sometimes, straight men aren't taken seriously there. Maybe it's because people assume fashion is \"for women.\" If a guy doesn't fit the typical \"fashion guy\" stereotype, people might question his knowledge.\n\nIt really depends on the industry.  I think gender discrimination exists in the US, but changing it is slow.  We've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is gradual. We need to keep pushing, though. Women are climbing into leadership positions, and even stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. It's happening, just slowly.\n\nMaybe we need to show the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. Not be too pushy, but highlight their strengths. If we force change, people resist. We're kind of at a good point where things are naturally shifting.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it completely legal, they just took it out of the criminal category. Now, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket. You know, you get a citation, but you don't get arrested and hauled into court.  I think if someone gets caught, it still might affect them when they're applying for jobs and stuff like that. Those consequences are usually the worst part of having a drug charge, especially for marijuana.  Lots of people worry about the future repercussions even after it's decriminalized.\n\nBut, there's an argument that it's really expensive to arrest people, hold them in jail, and process their cases.  Funding lawyers, court appearances, and prosecution all costs a lot of money.  Places with tight budgets might not want to give up that revenue even if it frees up resources. \n\nSome places are against marijuana and won't give ground on that, even if it could save money. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might make sense. Denver could use the saved money for things like education, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still kind of taboo in a lot of places, so having it out in the open could be awkward.  Plus, we don't know how it would affect driving and things like that.   Alcohol affects your motor skills more obviously, but marijuana can really mess with people's lives, not just their judgment.\n\nBoth substances have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people handle things well, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize, but they both have their downsides.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yeah, but... there are things about traditional Catholicism that both appeal and bother me.  Like, they stick to things the way they've always been done, which can be good for stability, you know? But it also feels kinda stuck in the past.  Things change, and sometimes the Church seems resistant to that.  \n\nIt feels like a lot of Catholics are expected to follow all the rules super strictly, and they can be harsh on people who don't perfectly fit the mold.  They don't seem very welcoming to folks from different faiths either.  \n\nThink of my parents – my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic church! How's that for loving thy neighbor? It's a real contradiction, you know? They preach love but then turn their backs on people who aren't exactly like them.\n\nThe teachings feel great, but the way things are actually done doesn't always match up. It's like they're stuck in the past, clinging to outdated ideas.\n\nNow, some people think allowing priests to marry would solve problems, but I'm not so sure.  It wouldn't necessarily stop anyone from doing bad things.  It's a different kind of issue altogether.  \n\nPeople who hurt kids, they're going to hurt kids, married or not. It's about them, not about their relationship status.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage... I'm still figuring it out.  I can't really say who's right or wrong, but it's definitely tough. It's like trying to balance the church and the government, you know?  And figuring out what marriage really means without upsetting anyone is a real challenge.  I think maybe we should just see all unions as civil partnerships.  Like, why does the government care what kind of ceremony people have?  If you're baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right? Same with marriage.  It's just two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in deciding what kind of marriage is valid.  Just two people, that's all that matters. \n\nAnd gay marriage... well,  it's the same thing!   Just two people wanting to be together. \n\nIf the states can all agree on something fair, they should make it a national law. But changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage is crazy!  The Constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people have strong feelings about it. It's not something that important.",
            "Hmm...my upbringing was Christian, so homosexuality is kinda tricky for me. See, I have lots of gay friends, ya know? I don't exactly agree with their lifestyle, but I think they should be allowed to marry. It shouldn't be a big national deal, though. Each state should get to decide, not the president making rules for everyone.\n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, right? So, if you live in a state that's okay with it, you gotta respect their choice, ya know? Like, you chose to live there! \n\nBasically, I think gay folks deserve the same chances as straight folks. So, legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already kinda answered this, but yeah, I don't think Bush should be able to say the whole country has to be against gay marriage. States should decide for themselves. I don't like his ban on it.\n\nIt just doesn't seem right. Bush doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to say what they can or can't do? Some things should be left up to the states, ya know? Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president wants to change things, it'll just become a back-and-forth.\n\nIt should just be up to the states because they're the ones who have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, here's the thing about Myspace. It's like, it's public, right? It's a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you put something on there, you gotta expect people to see it. Like, even if it's not under the school's name, they could still find it. Think about it, people can check Myspace at home.\n\nNow, if the school is looking at Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like a shooting, I think that's okay. Their job is to keep students safe, and if that means looking at Myspace, well, that's what they gotta do. \n\nBut here's the thing about them going on Myspace just to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels different. That's like an invasion of privacy, you know? \n\nIt's just that, if they're trying to make the school safer, and maybe even save lives, I think it's worth it. \n\nIt's a bit tricky, though.  Like, it's easier to think things through when you're writing, right?  I mean, even emails, I'm careful about what I say. You never know who might read it later.\n\nThings you post online, they stay online forever.  It's like, once it's out there, there's no taking it back.\n\nSo yeah, I think if the school's looking at Myspace to prevent something bad, it's okay. But if they're just snooping around, that's a problem.",
            "Okay, so, you know, after 9/11, I was all for getting involved. I felt it personally, and I wanted to hit them hard, just like they hit us. But looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. We didn't really think things through, and we went into it unprepared. It just backfired.\n\nHonestly, I was for it at first, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think we've accomplished anything. See, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting with us.  It's like, what's the point of us being there if they can't even get along?\n\nBecause of 9/11, I've just lost interest in what happens over there. They're a mess, always fighting, always at each other's throats. I just don't get them.\n\nThe truth is, we went in unprepared. We didn't know what to expect. And war is different there. They're brutal, savage. I don't think they're trying to better their country; they just want us out.\n\nAnd maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave. We were all hyped up, looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it. He felt like he had to do something, I get it.\n\nBut it all felt wrong. We should have had a plan, a clear strategy for what we were going to do. There was no unity, no purpose. It was just emotions and anger driving us. That's all we created over there - more anger.\n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're always going to be like that. It's been too long, and we're not making enough progress. We've made some, sure, but not enough to justify staying.  We can't stay there forever. We're just hurting ourselves."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmm, I think the Catholic Church could use a little update, you know?  People are saying it's losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things. Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that they have strong beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past. If they were a bit more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't be worried about people leaving.  I've heard folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these issues.  They just don't see eye to eye.  For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might feel uncomfortable being part of a group that says it's completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not feel welcome in a place that opposes it. Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or priests who are married.  But who knows if that would have stopped the recent scandals?  It's hard to say for sure. Maybe they would have done it anyway.  It's just weird that they expect priests to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.  It seems unfair.",
            "Mmm, okay. See, personally, I'm totally cool with gay people getting married.  I mean, whether someone is born that way or, you know, whatever, I just don't think it's something you choose, right? So, I don't think we should blame people for how they feel about who they love. It just seems wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really spent a lot of time thinking about it, but yeah, I definitely think it's wrong to say that.\n\nIt's kind of like, you know, I was born straight, and some people are born gay. It doesn't seem like a choice you make. They shouldn't have to feel bad about who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to treat them differently. Honestly, I don't think the government should get involved. It's not really a legal issue, or even a big moral issue. I don't think it's fair to put them on display like they made a mistake or something.\n\nSo, I don't think the government should have a say in it.\n\nIt's a bit tricky, you know?\n\n(laughs)  \n\nOkay, well, I just don't think the government should get involved because it's not like it affects our country's safety or anything. It's not like a moral issue. It just seems like they're overstepping.  They shouldn't be telling people how to live their lives. It's just who they are, you know? And they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "So, I think gay marriage should be totally legal, you know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are bad news for traditional families, but it's just not the same thing at all. It's like two sides of the same coin – different but connected.  Plus, there are tons of rights that come with marriage, like healthcare and property stuff. Imagine if your partner couldn't be with you in the hospital because they're not officially family. That's messed up, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same stuff that makes relationships work. They're just in love, just like everyone else. It's all about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nWhat really bugs me is the whole church and state thing. Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal marriage certificate from the government. If the government isn't getting involved in religion, then what's the big deal? \n\nIt's like saying no to civil unions but yes to marriage. That's just unfair. It's like segregation – separate but not equal.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and community stuff, but honestly, it's all about individual families, not just being gay.  Gay parents can be just as good as straight parents.  And those kids deserve the same love and support as any other kid.\n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It should be a right for everyone.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and you know, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Like, I think making it available to everyone, nah, not a good idea. But for medicine, I'm all for it.  Just 'cause it's against the law doesn't mean it can't be helpful, right?\n\nI mean, think about it, pharmacies use all kinds of drugs that are illegal, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet - those are serious stuff, but they're super useful for people.  If we can't see the good in marijuana just because it's got a bad reputation, that's not right. We gotta be open to its benefits.\n\nIt's different from alcohol, though.  Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and marijuana can too, but I think the key is to approach it slowly. Making it legal all at once might lead to problems, but if we start by getting rid of the stigma, maybe people will use it responsibly.\n\nPeople think marijuana is this terrible drug just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine. It's not that harmful. If we change how people see it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Hmm...the church, it's changed a lot since I was a little girl. It's not as strict anymore. Back then, I was always going to Sunday mass, all dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes and purses. It was every Sunday, you know, even when I went to private school. I'd see all my friends there on the weekends. \n\nBut now, things are different. They have this special mass for teenagers, just thirty minutes long, and people dress super casual. Even in the summer, some come straight from the beach! Families are always rushing in late. It's a lot more relaxed even at the morning masses.  I used to get all dressed up for those, but now people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's the church I know now. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but yeah, that's it.",
            "(laughs) \nYou know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still really shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration kept saying the war was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction – which, by the way, turned out to be completely untrue. \nThat really rubs me the wrong way. Honestly, the whole Iraq war just makes me furious. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, after giving that big presentation at the UN, has said he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious abuse of power – it's practically grounds for impeachment.  \nThey just seem to have no respect for the Constitution and have been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. They came into office with a plan to go to war, it seems like.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – who basically said that in his book after they kicked him out. It felt like Bush Jr. had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably also wanted to secure our energy supply by controlling the region. That's a pretty shady way to go about things.\n\nHonestly, it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would be messy, though. There's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and even more people would die.  \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to step in and restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It'll probably create more problems down the road because it undermines Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting recently, now has a bunch of seats in Parliament.  There are all these different groups fighting for power, and it's just creating a lot of chaos.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting too graphic.",
            "Ugh, this whole thing about the war in Iraq is such a mess. To be honest, I don’t even know where to begin. It feels pointless because it wasn’t officially declared a war, you know? It just seems like a way for us to get back at them for 9/11, like they were the only ones who could have possibly done it.\n\nHonestly, I’m not really into keeping up with all the details of the war. But I get the feeling we’re just staying there to try and build a democracy that’s more like the U.S. and to get their oil.  \n\nThe problem is, it’s making everyone upset, both there and here.  It’s like, if we stay, we’ll try to force democracy on them, but that takes forever. And if we leave, they’ll be angry because they’ll feel like we messed everything up and they have to start over. \n\nIt’s so complicated. It feels like there’s no good answer. \n\nI guess maybe it’s better to stay and help them, but it’s also a waste of resources. And it’s making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation. \n\nIt’s hard because I know families who have loved ones over there, and I want them to be safe. But then there are all these Iraqi families who have lost everything because of the fighting. It’s heartbreaking.\n\nIt’s like trying to change their culture to be more like ours, but that might make things even worse. It could make them hate us more.\n\nThis whole thing is just going to drag on and on. Ugh.",
            "Okay, so, I just don't think it's right for the government to get involved in making this legal or illegal. Like, the Constitution clearly says there should be separation of church and state, right? So trying to force a law on this would go against that.  It's like picking one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it's not the government's place to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important to religious freedom in America. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, that would be totally wrong. It would be one of the few amendments that limits people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI definitely don't think the government should be involved at all.  This guy pushing for an amendment is just trying to push his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government. There's no good reason for an amendment except for his personal views. I don't see how it would hurt the economy or anything – maybe even help!",
            "Okay, so let me tell you about this whole Iraq war thing.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th attacks, but really, they weren't that connected. The government made it seem like they were, though, using everyone's anger and fear from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made there.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't really prepared for what would happen after.  They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt, or how hard it would be to rebuild. It's like what they tried to do in Vietnam - pushing out Communists and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut the US government should have known it wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and it's not always a clear victory.  Vietnam was a loss, even if some people supported us. It's hard to win when you're fighting the entire population, not a regular army.\n\nSo, I think the government made a huge mistake going into this war. Even if you decide to go to war, you need to be prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government, and now we're still there years later.  \n\nThey made it seem like it would be a quick and successful mission, but that's just not how it works. Building a new government takes time and effort, just like it did in our own country.  It's not a simple fix.\n\nIt's really tough because we've been there for so long now. How can we just abandon these people after we took away their government and way of life?  But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, it seems like this whole thing might be about oil. We're getting our oil from there, after all. It's all about money and resources. We were also told Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though we know they have weapons.  \n\nI don't think the US government is being honest with us about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure it will.",
            "Hmm... let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage. Always have been. It's something deeply personal, don't you think? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just a choice. It wouldn't be fair to take away someone's rights just because they're born a certain way, right? That seems kind of cruel.\n\nI've always been on the side of equality for everyone. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's about love and commitment, things that happen at home, in families.\n\nLike, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples. They're not married, of course, because the law doesn't allow it. But they live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, going about their day. Why should it matter?\n\nIt's like Bush trying to play God and decide what marriage means. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nYou know, I've read a lot about how there might be a chemical difference in the brains of gay people. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose. Like, maybe having lots of sisters and no brothers doesn't make you gay, right?\n\nExcept for the obvious reasons, it's kind of unfair. If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas and no one would even know. But if two gay people want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It's like it should be a private matter, not something everyone else needs to know about. It's their relationship, not the government's business.",

It's the same online.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's for everyone.\n\nSchools have to act when they hear something concerning, even if it's just a rumor. They can't just ignore it and hope for the best.  What if something bad happens? They'd regret not taking action.  \n\nOf course, not everything online is serious. Sometimes people joke around, but it's tricky to tell the difference.  It's like that time we had at school where a harmless experiment went wrong and everyone panicked.  But sometimes, those online posts can be really serious, too. \n\nThere was this one case where someone overheard a conversation at school, and they reported it.  When they looked at the person's Facebook, they found some things that seemed harmless at first but became really worrying given the situation.\n\nSo, basically, once you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see.  Think before you post!  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online.  You can't control how people interpret it, but you can control what you share.",
            "This war feels like it's dragged on way too long. I get that the starting point had good intentions – helping another country get democracy. But I feel like we've forgotten that original goal. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove how powerful we are.  Plus, I think there were some questionable reasons for starting the war in the first place, like maybe old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  \n\nIf the goal was truly to give democracy to a country without fair politics, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, it wouldn't be fair.  \n\nI think we made our point in the early days of the war. That was a statement in itself. But the fact that it's been going on for years now just seems excessive.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that's a noble reason to fight. But I think our purpose has become muddled over time. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to win a decisive victory.\n\nThis war has lasted long enough. It's time for their government and people to take charge. We've been spending billions of dollars, draining our own economy, when we have problems here at home like poverty and crumbling infrastructure that need attention. That money could be better spent on improving our own lives.\n\nWe can't be in a constant state of war. There are so many other important things we need to focus on, like education, healthcare, and fixing our roads. It's heartbreaking to see money being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost sight of.",
            "Let me ask something, can you explain how this was stopped?  Someone looked online and saw something, right? Okay, I don't think that's bad. On sites like Myspace, if you put something online, anyone can see it.  I know on Myspace you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you've chosen to be friends with them, so they can see it. So, whenever you put things online, you have to understand that lots of people will see it. If someone saw something and could stop something bad from happening, I think that’s good.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day.  It would feel discriminatory to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job to just look at people's profiles. I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. It makes me uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a news story about a man who showed how easy it is to find information about people online. He found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet him. I wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they know my interests, what I look like, when I'm in class, and who my friends are. They can see lots of photos. I try to limit what I share, but it's hard because Facebook is for connecting with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who is looking at your profile.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace, and I thought that was strange. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I don't know if it's really a privacy issue, but I don't know how they have the right to tell people what they can and can't do. That's all I can think of.",
            "Hmm, you know... This whole Iraq War thing, it's a tough one for me. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, like everyone else who's suddenly against it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not like my opinion really matters now.  It's just... everyone knows it was a bad idea, except, well, the people in charge who don't want to admit they messed up.  \n\nSeriously, look at the polls! Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the whole world, people are saying it was a mistake.  Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the US troops over there, they all think we should get out. \n\nFrom the beginning, it was a disaster. And now pulling out? That's a disaster too.  The Middle East is just so complicated. It's like there's this huge gap between our way of life and theirs.  We can't just force democracy on them like it's some magic solution.  I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt. But invading a country and making it a total mess?  That's not the answer.\n\nI just don't get why we're still there. What's the point? I haven't heard any good reasons for staying. Sure, they might have some ideas, but I don't buy it.\n\nIf we're going to leave, let's just do it.  Maybe a year, maybe a little longer, but let's get out.  The Iraqi people are telling us to leave. They're the ones we're trying to help, right? Maybe they know best. \n\nAt least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" we can't be blamed if things go south. We'll be able to say, \"Hey, you asked us to leave.\"",
            "You know, I really think gender bias is still a thing in the United States.  It's not just women who face it, though. It seems to depend on what field you're in.  \n\nOverall, I feel like women have a tougher time because of this invisible barrier, this \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, a lot of people struggle with the idea of working under a woman. Society has been this way for so long, you know?  \n\nSo, women often see a job they're totally qualified for, but maybe the board won't promote them because historically, women aren't usually in leadership roles in business. \n\nThe same goes for men in certain fields, like parenting at home. It's uncommon to see a dad stay home while his wife works. People often judge that, thinking \"You're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  It can be tough on these dads when maybe they've always dreamed of being at home with their kids, and their wife is happy with her job.  \n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Sometimes, straight men aren't taken seriously there. Maybe it's because people assume fashion is \"for women.\" If a guy doesn't fit the typical \"fashion guy\" stereotype, people might question his knowledge.\n\nIt really depends on the industry.  I think gender discrimination exists in the US, but changing it is slow.  We've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is gradual. We need to keep pushing, though. Women are climbing into leadership positions, and even stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. It's happening, just slowly.\n\nMaybe we need to show the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. Not be too pushy, but highlight their strengths. If we force change, people resist. We're kind of at a good point where things are naturally shifting.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it completely legal, they just took it out of the criminal category. Now, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket. You know, you get a citation, but you don't get arrested and hauled into court.  I think if someone gets caught, it still might affect them when they're applying for jobs and stuff like that. Those consequences are usually the worst part of having a drug charge, especially for marijuana.  Lots of people worry about the future repercussions even after it's decriminalized.\n\nBut, there's an argument that it's really expensive to arrest people, hold them in jail, and process their cases.  Funding lawyers, court appearances, and prosecution all costs a lot of money.  Places with tight budgets might not want to give up that revenue even if it frees up resources. \n\nSome places are against marijuana and won't give ground on that, even if it could save money. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might make sense. Denver could use the saved money for things like education, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still kind of taboo in a lot of places, so having it out in the open could be awkward.  Plus, we don't know how it would affect driving and things like that.   Alcohol affects your motor skills more obviously, but marijuana can really mess with people's lives, not just their judgment.\n\nBoth substances have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people handle things well, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize, but they both have their downsides.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yeah, but... there are things about traditional Catholicism that both appeal and bother me.  Like, they stick to things the way they've always been done, which can be good for stability, you know? But it also feels kinda stuck in the past.  Things change, and sometimes the Church seems resistant to that.  \n\nIt feels like a lot of Catholics are expected to follow all the rules super strictly, and they can be harsh on people who don't perfectly fit the mold.  They don't seem very welcoming to folks from different faiths either.  \n\nThink of my parents – my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic church! How's that for loving thy neighbor? It's a real contradiction, you know? They preach love but then turn their backs on people who aren't exactly like them.\n\nThe teachings feel great, but the way things are actually done doesn't always match up. It's like they're stuck in the past, clinging to outdated ideas.\n\nNow, some people think allowing priests to marry would solve problems, but I'm not so sure.  It wouldn't necessarily stop anyone from doing bad things.  It's a different kind of issue altogether.  \n\nPeople who hurt kids, they're going to hurt kids, married or not. It's about them, not about their relationship status.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage... I'm still figuring it out.  I can't really say who's right or wrong, but it's definitely tough. It's like trying to balance the church and the government, you know?  And figuring out what marriage really means without upsetting anyone is a real challenge.  I think maybe we should just see all unions as civil partnerships.  Like, why does the government care what kind of ceremony people have?  If you're baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right? Same with marriage.  It's just two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in deciding what kind of marriage is valid.  Just two people, that's all that matters. \n\nAnd gay marriage... well,  it's the same thing!   Just two people wanting to be together. \n\nIf the states can all agree on something fair, they should make it a national law. But changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage is crazy!  The Constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people have strong feelings about it. It's not something that important.",
            "Hmm...my upbringing was Christian, so homosexuality is kinda tricky for me. See, I have lots of gay friends, ya know? I don't exactly agree with their lifestyle, but I think they should be allowed to marry. It shouldn't be a big national deal, though. Each state should get to decide, not the president making rules for everyone.\n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, right? So, if you live in a state that's okay with it, you gotta respect their choice, ya know? Like, you chose to live there! \n\nBasically, I think gay folks deserve the same chances as straight folks. So, legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already kinda answered this, but yeah, I don't think Bush should be able to say the whole country has to be against gay marriage. States should decide for themselves. I don't like his ban on it.\n\nIt just doesn't seem right. Bush doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to say what they can or can't do? Some things should be left up to the states, ya know? Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president wants to change things, it'll just become a back-and-forth.\n\nIt should just be up to the states because they're the ones who have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, here's the thing about Myspace. It's like, it's public, right? It's a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you put something on there, you gotta expect people to see it. Like, even if it's not under the school's name, they could still find it. Think about it, people can check Myspace at home.\n\nNow, if the school is looking at Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like a shooting, I think that's okay. Their job is to keep students safe, and if that means looking at Myspace, well, that's what they gotta do. \n\nBut here's the thing about them going on Myspace just to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels different. That's like an invasion of privacy, you know? \n\nIt's just that, if they're trying to make the school safer, and maybe even save lives, I think it's worth it. \n\nIt's a bit tricky, though.  Like, it's easier to think things through when you're writing, right?  I mean, even emails, I'm careful about what I say. You never know who might read it later.\n\nThings you post online, they stay online forever.  It's like, once it's out there, there's no taking it back.\n\nSo yeah, I think if the school's looking at Myspace to prevent something bad, it's okay. But if they're just snooping around, that's a problem.",
            "Okay, so, you know, after 9/11, I was all for getting involved. I felt it personally, and I wanted to hit them hard, just like they hit us. But looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. We didn't really think things through, and we went into it unprepared. It just backfired.\n\nHonestly, I was for it at first, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think we've accomplished anything. See, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting with us.  It's like, what's the point of us being there if they can't even get along?\n\nBecause of 9/11, I've just lost interest in what happens over there. They're a mess, always fighting, always at each other's throats. I just don't get them.\n\nThe truth is, we went in unprepared. We didn't know what to expect. And war is different there. They're brutal, savage. I don't think they're trying to better their country; they just want us out.\n\nAnd maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave. We were all hyped up, looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it. He felt like he had to do something, I get it.\n\nBut it all felt wrong. We should have had a plan, a clear strategy for what we were going to do. There was no unity, no purpose. It was just emotions and anger driving us. That's all we created over there - more anger.\n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're always going to be like that. It's been too long, and we're not making enough progress. We've made some, sure, but not enough to justify staying.  We can't stay there forever. We're just hurting ourselves."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmm, I think the Catholic Church could use a little update, you know?  People are saying it's losing followers, and I think it's because they aren't very accepting of certain things. Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that they have strong beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the past. If they were a bit more open-minded, maybe they wouldn't be worried about people leaving.  I've heard folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with their views on these issues.  They just don't see eye to eye.  For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might feel uncomfortable being part of a group that says it's completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not feel welcome in a place that opposes it. Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or priests who are married.  But who knows if that would have stopped the recent scandals?  It's hard to say for sure. Maybe they would have done it anyway.  It's just weird that they expect priests to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.  It seems unfair.",
            "Mmm, okay. See, personally, I'm totally cool with gay people getting married.  I mean, whether someone is born that way or, you know, whatever, I just don't think it's something you choose, right? So, I don't think we should blame people for how they feel about who they love. It just seems wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really spent a lot of time thinking about it, but yeah, I definitely think it's wrong to say that.\n\nIt's kind of like, you know, I was born straight, and some people are born gay. It doesn't seem like a choice you make. They shouldn't have to feel bad about who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to treat them differently. Honestly, I don't think the government should get involved. It's not really a legal issue, or even a big moral issue. I don't think it's fair to put them on display like they made a mistake or something.\n\nSo, I don't think the government should have a say in it.\n\nIt's a bit tricky, you know?\n\n(laughs)  \n\nOkay, well, I just don't think the government should get involved because it's not like it affects our country's safety or anything. It's not like a moral issue. It just seems like they're overstepping.  They shouldn't be telling people how to live their lives. It's just who they are, you know? And they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "So, I think gay marriage should be totally legal, you know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are bad news for traditional families, but it's just not the same thing at all. It's like two sides of the same coin – different but connected.  Plus, there are tons of rights that come with marriage, like healthcare and property stuff. Imagine if your partner couldn't be with you in the hospital because they're not officially family. That's messed up, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same stuff that makes relationships work. They're just in love, just like everyone else. It's all about the relationship, not who's involved.\n\nWhat really bugs me is the whole church and state thing. Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal marriage certificate from the government. If the government isn't getting involved in religion, then what's the big deal? \n\nIt's like saying no to civil unions but yes to marriage. That's just unfair. It's like segregation – separate but not equal.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and community stuff, but honestly, it's all about individual families, not just being gay.  Gay parents can be just as good as straight parents.  And those kids deserve the same love and support as any other kid.\n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It should be a right for everyone.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and you know, just because something's illegal doesn't automatically mean it's bad. Like, I think making it available to everyone, nah, not a good idea. But for medicine, I'm all for it.  Just 'cause it's against the law doesn't mean it can't be helpful, right?\n\nI mean, think about it, pharmacies use all kinds of drugs that are illegal, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet - those are serious stuff, but they're super useful for people.  If we can't see the good in marijuana just because it's got a bad reputation, that's not right. We gotta be open to its benefits.\n\nIt's different from alcohol, though.  Alcohol can be bad if you overdo it, and marijuana can too, but I think the key is to approach it slowly. Making it legal all at once might lead to problems, but if we start by getting rid of the stigma, maybe people will use it responsibly.\n\nPeople think marijuana is this terrible drug just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine. It's not that harmful. If we change how people see it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Hmm...the church, it's changed a lot since I was a little girl. It's not as strict anymore. Back then, I was always going to Sunday mass, all dressed up in cute dresses, matching shoes and purses. It was every Sunday, you know, even when I went to private school. I'd see all my friends there on the weekends. \n\nBut now, things are different. They have this special mass for teenagers, just thirty minutes long, and people dress super casual. Even in the summer, some come straight from the beach! Families are always rushing in late. It's a lot more relaxed even at the morning masses.  I used to get all dressed up for those, but now people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. It's the church I know now. I don't know much about the politics of the church, but yeah, that's it.",
            "(laughs) \nYou know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still really shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration kept saying the war was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction – which, by the way, turned out to be completely untrue. \nThat really rubs me the wrong way. Honestly, the whole Iraq war just makes me furious. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, after giving that big presentation at the UN, has said he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious abuse of power – it's practically grounds for impeachment.  \nThey just seem to have no respect for the Constitution and have been trying to weaken it ever since 9/11. They came into office with a plan to go to war, it seems like.\n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – who basically said that in his book after they kicked him out. It felt like Bush Jr. had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he probably also wanted to secure our energy supply by controlling the region. That's a pretty shady way to go about things.\n\nHonestly, it's gone on long enough. Pulling out right now would be messy, though. There's a good chance the country would fall into civil war and even more people would die.  \n\nIt seems like the UN and the US are trying to get other countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to step in and restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It'll probably create more problems down the road because it undermines Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe interim government is falling apart. The Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have much control. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting recently, now has a bunch of seats in Parliament.  There are all these different groups fighting for power, and it's just creating a lot of chaos.\n\n(laughs)\nI can't really say more about it without getting too graphic.",
            "Ugh, this whole thing about the war in Iraq is such a mess. To be honest, I don’t even know where to begin. It feels pointless because it wasn’t officially declared a war, you know? It just seems like a way for us to get back at them for 9/11, like they were the only ones who could have possibly done it.\n\nHonestly, I’m not really into keeping up with all the details of the war. But I get the feeling we’re just staying there to try and build a democracy that’s more like the U.S. and to get their oil.  \n\nThe problem is, it’s making everyone upset, both there and here.  It’s like, if we stay, we’ll try to force democracy on them, but that takes forever. And if we leave, they’ll be angry because they’ll feel like we messed everything up and they have to start over. \n\nIt’s so complicated. It feels like there’s no good answer. \n\nI guess maybe it’s better to stay and help them, but it’s also a waste of resources. And it’s making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam situation. \n\nIt’s hard because I know families who have loved ones over there, and I want them to be safe. But then there are all these Iraqi families who have lost everything because of the fighting. It’s heartbreaking.\n\nIt’s like trying to change their culture to be more like ours, but that might make things even worse. It could make them hate us more.\n\nThis whole thing is just going to drag on and on. Ugh.",
            "Okay, so, I just don't think it's right for the government to get involved in making this legal or illegal. Like, the Constitution clearly says there should be separation of church and state, right? So trying to force a law on this would go against that.  It's like picking one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it's not the government's place to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important to religious freedom in America. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, that would be totally wrong. It would be one of the few amendments that limits people instead of the government. I just don't think it's right.\n\nI definitely don't think the government should be involved at all.  This guy pushing for an amendment is just trying to push his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government. There's no good reason for an amendment except for his personal views. I don't see how it would hurt the economy or anything – maybe even help!",
            "Okay, so let me tell you about this whole Iraq war thing.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th attacks, but really, they weren't that connected. The government made it seem like they were, though, using everyone's anger and fear from 9/11 to push for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This Iraq war feels a lot like Vietnam, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made there.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's terrible.  \n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't really prepared for what would happen after.  They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt, or how hard it would be to rebuild. It's like what they tried to do in Vietnam - pushing out Communists and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut the US government should have known it wouldn't be easy. It's a long and hard process, and it's not always a clear victory.  Vietnam was a loss, even if some people supported us. It's hard to win when you're fighting the entire population, not a regular army.\n\nSo, I think the government made a huge mistake going into this war. Even if you decide to go to war, you need to be prepared for everything. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government, and now we're still there years later.  \n\nThey made it seem like it would be a quick and successful mission, but that's just not how it works. Building a new government takes time and effort, just like it did in our own country.  It's not a simple fix.\n\nIt's really tough because we've been there for so long now. How can we just abandon these people after we took away their government and way of life?  But at what cost? How many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, it seems like this whole thing might be about oil. We're getting our oil from there, after all. It's all about money and resources. We were also told Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though we know they have weapons.  \n\nI don't think the US government is being honest with us about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But I'm not sure it will.",
            "Hmm... let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage. Always have been. It's something deeply personal, don't you think? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just a choice. It wouldn't be fair to take away someone's rights just because they're born a certain way, right? That seems kind of cruel.\n\nI've always been on the side of equality for everyone. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's about love and commitment, things that happen at home, in families.\n\nLike, in my neighborhood back home, there are a few openly gay couples. They're not married, of course, because the law doesn't allow it. But they live their lives just like any other family – walking their dogs, going about their day. Why should it matter?\n\nIt's like Bush trying to play God and decide what marriage means. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nYou know, I've read a lot about how there might be a chemical difference in the brains of gay people. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose. Like, maybe having lots of sisters and no brothers doesn't make you gay, right?\n\nExcept for the obvious reasons, it's kind of unfair. If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas and no one would even know. But if two gay people want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It's like it should be a private matter, not something everyone else needs to know about. It's their relationship, not the government's business.",

It's the same online.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's for everyone.\n\nSchools have to act when they hear something concerning, even if it's just a rumor. They can't just ignore it and hope for the best.  What if something bad happens? They'd regret not taking action.  \n\nOf course, not everything online is serious. Sometimes people joke around, but it's tricky to tell the difference.  It's like that time we had at school where a harmless experiment went wrong and everyone panicked.  But sometimes, those online posts can be really serious, too. \n\nThere was this one case where someone overheard a conversation at school, and they reported it.  When they looked at the person's Facebook, they found some things that seemed harmless at first but became really worrying given the situation.\n\nSo, basically, once you put something online, it's out there for everyone to see.  Think before you post!  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online.  You can't control how people interpret it, but you can control what you share.",
            "This war feels like it's dragged on way too long. I get that the starting point had good intentions – helping another country get democracy. But I feel like we've forgotten that original goal. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove how powerful we are.  Plus, I think there were some questionable reasons for starting the war in the first place, like maybe old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  \n\nIf the goal was truly to give democracy to a country without fair politics, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, it wouldn't be fair.  \n\nI think we made our point in the early days of the war. That was a statement in itself. But the fact that it's been going on for years now just seems excessive.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that's a noble reason to fight. But I think our purpose has become muddled over time. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to win a decisive victory.\n\nThis war has lasted long enough. It's time for their government and people to take charge. We've been spending billions of dollars, draining our own economy, when we have problems here at home like poverty and crumbling infrastructure that need attention. That money could be better spent on improving our own lives.\n\nWe can't be in a constant state of war. There are so many other important things we need to focus on, like education, healthcare, and fixing our roads. It's heartbreaking to see money being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost sight of.",
            "Let me ask something, can you explain how this was stopped?  Someone looked online and saw something, right? Okay, I don't think that's bad. On sites like Myspace, if you put something online, anyone can see it.  I know on Myspace you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you've chosen to be friends with them, so they can see it. So, whenever you put things online, you have to understand that lots of people will see it. If someone saw something and could stop something bad from happening, I think that’s good.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have one person watching everyone's profiles all day.  It would feel discriminatory to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job to just look at people's profiles. I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or were they just randomly looking?\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook. It makes me uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a news story about a man who showed how easy it is to find information about people online. He found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet him. I wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they know my interests, what I look like, when I'm in class, and who my friends are. They can see lots of photos. I try to limit what I share, but it's hard because Facebook is for connecting with friends. It's a tricky balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who is looking at your profile.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace, and I thought that was strange. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I don't know if it's really a privacy issue, but I don't know how they have the right to tell people what they can and can't do. That's all I can think of.",
            "Hmm, you know... This whole Iraq War thing, it's a tough one for me. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, like everyone else who's suddenly against it. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not like my opinion really matters now.  It's just... everyone knows it was a bad idea, except, well, the people in charge who don't want to admit they messed up.  \n\nSeriously, look at the polls! Everywhere you look, from the US to Iraq to the whole world, people are saying it was a mistake.  Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the US troops over there, they all think we should get out. \n\nFrom the beginning, it was a disaster. And now pulling out? That's a disaster too.  The Middle East is just so complicated. It's like there's this huge gap between our way of life and theirs.  We can't just force democracy on them like it's some magic solution.  I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt. But invading a country and making it a total mess?  That's not the answer.\n\nI just don't get why we're still there. What's the point? I haven't heard any good reasons for staying. Sure, they might have some ideas, but I don't buy it.\n\nIf we're going to leave, let's just do it.  Maybe a year, maybe a little longer, but let's get out.  The Iraqi people are telling us to leave. They're the ones we're trying to help, right? Maybe they know best. \n\nAt least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" we can't be blamed if things go south. We'll be able to say, \"Hey, you asked us to leave.\"",
            "You know, I really think gender bias is still a thing in the United States.  It's not just women who face it, though. It seems to depend on what field you're in.  \n\nOverall, I feel like women have a tougher time because of this invisible barrier, this \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, a lot of people struggle with the idea of working under a woman. Society has been this way for so long, you know?  \n\nSo, women often see a job they're totally qualified for, but maybe the board won't promote them because historically, women aren't usually in leadership roles in business. \n\nThe same goes for men in certain fields, like parenting at home. It's uncommon to see a dad stay home while his wife works. People often judge that, thinking \"You're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  It can be tough on these dads when maybe they've always dreamed of being at home with their kids, and their wife is happy with her job.  \n\nAnd then there's the fashion industry.  Sometimes, straight men aren't taken seriously there. Maybe it's because people assume fashion is \"for women.\" If a guy doesn't fit the typical \"fashion guy\" stereotype, people might question his knowledge.\n\nIt really depends on the industry.  I think gender discrimination exists in the US, but changing it is slow.  We've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is gradual. We need to keep pushing, though. Women are climbing into leadership positions, and even stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. It's happening, just slowly.\n\nMaybe we need to show the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. Not be too pushy, but highlight their strengths. If we force change, people resist. We're kind of at a good point where things are naturally shifting.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it completely legal, they just took it out of the criminal category. Now, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket. You know, you get a citation, but you don't get arrested and hauled into court.  I think if someone gets caught, it still might affect them when they're applying for jobs and stuff like that. Those consequences are usually the worst part of having a drug charge, especially for marijuana.  Lots of people worry about the future repercussions even after it's decriminalized.\n\nBut, there's an argument that it's really expensive to arrest people, hold them in jail, and process their cases.  Funding lawyers, court appearances, and prosecution all costs a lot of money.  Places with tight budgets might not want to give up that revenue even if it frees up resources. \n\nSome places are against marijuana and won't give ground on that, even if it could save money. But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might make sense. Denver could use the saved money for things like education, helping the elderly, or feeding the homeless.\n\nIt's important to remember that we don't want marijuana everywhere, like cigarettes. It's still kind of taboo in a lot of places, so having it out in the open could be awkward.  Plus, we don't know how it would affect driving and things like that.   Alcohol affects your motor skills more obviously, but marijuana can really mess with people's lives, not just their judgment.\n\nBoth substances have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people handle things well, while others go overboard. It's hard to generalize, but they both have their downsides.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yeah, but... there are things about traditional Catholicism that both appeal and bother me.  Like, they stick to things the way they've always been done, which can be good for stability, you know? But it also feels kinda stuck in the past.  Things change, and sometimes the Church seems resistant to that.  \n\nIt feels like a lot of Catholics are expected to follow all the rules super strictly, and they can be harsh on people who don't perfectly fit the mold.  They don't seem very welcoming to folks from different faiths either.  \n\nThink of my parents – my mom was Catholic, my dad Episcopalian. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic church! How's that for loving thy neighbor? It's a real contradiction, you know? They preach love but then turn their backs on people who aren't exactly like them.\n\nThe teachings feel great, but the way things are actually done doesn't always match up. It's like they're stuck in the past, clinging to outdated ideas.\n\nNow, some people think allowing priests to marry would solve problems, but I'm not so sure.  It wouldn't necessarily stop anyone from doing bad things.  It's a different kind of issue altogether.  \n\nPeople who hurt kids, they're going to hurt kids, married or not. It's about them, not about their relationship status.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage... I'm still figuring it out.  I can't really say who's right or wrong, but it's definitely tough. It's like trying to balance the church and the government, you know?  And figuring out what marriage really means without upsetting anyone is a real challenge.  I think maybe we should just see all unions as civil partnerships.  Like, why does the government care what kind of ceremony people have?  If you're baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right? Same with marriage.  It's just two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in deciding what kind of marriage is valid.  Just two people, that's all that matters. \n\nAnd gay marriage... well,  it's the same thing!   Just two people wanting to be together. \n\nIf the states can all agree on something fair, they should make it a national law. But changing the Constitution to ban gay marriage is crazy!  The Constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people have strong feelings about it. It's not something that important.",
            "Hmm...my upbringing was Christian, so homosexuality is kinda tricky for me. See, I have lots of gay friends, ya know? I don't exactly agree with their lifestyle, but I think they should be allowed to marry. It shouldn't be a big national deal, though. Each state should get to decide, not the president making rules for everyone.\n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, right? So, if you live in a state that's okay with it, you gotta respect their choice, ya know? Like, you chose to live there! \n\nBasically, I think gay folks deserve the same chances as straight folks. So, legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already kinda answered this, but yeah, I don't think Bush should be able to say the whole country has to be against gay marriage. States should decide for themselves. I don't like his ban on it.\n\nIt just doesn't seem right. Bush doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to say what they can or can't do? Some things should be left up to the states, ya know? Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president wants to change things, it'll just become a back-and-forth.\n\nIt should just be up to the states because they're the ones who have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, here's the thing about Myspace. It's like, it's public, right? It's a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you put something on there, you gotta expect people to see it. Like, even if it's not under the school's name, they could still find it. Think about it, people can check Myspace at home.\n\nNow, if the school is looking at Myspace to prevent something bad from happening, like a shooting, I think that's okay. Their job is to keep students safe, and if that means looking at Myspace, well, that's what they gotta do. \n\nBut here's the thing about them going on Myspace just to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels different. That's like an invasion of privacy, you know? \n\nIt's just that, if they're trying to make the school safer, and maybe even save lives, I think it's worth it. \n\nIt's a bit tricky, though.  Like, it's easier to think things through when you're writing, right?  I mean, even emails, I'm careful about what I say. You never know who might read it later.\n\nThings you post online, they stay online forever.  It's like, once it's out there, there's no taking it back.\n\nSo yeah, I think if the school's looking at Myspace to prevent something bad, it's okay. But if they're just snooping around, that's a problem.",
            "Okay, so, you know, after 9/11, I was all for getting involved. I felt it personally, and I wanted to hit them hard, just like they hit us. But looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. We didn't really think things through, and we went into it unprepared. It just backfired.\n\nHonestly, I was for it at first, but now I'm completely against it. I don't think we've accomplished anything. See, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting with us.  It's like, what's the point of us being there if they can't even get along?\n\nBecause of 9/11, I've just lost interest in what happens over there. They're a mess, always fighting, always at each other's throats. I just don't get them.\n\nThe truth is, we went in unprepared. We didn't know what to expect. And war is different there. They're brutal, savage. I don't think they're trying to better their country; they just want us out.\n\nAnd maybe that's okay. Maybe we should just leave. We were all hyped up, looking for revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because people wanted it. He felt like he had to do something, I get it.\n\nBut it all felt wrong. We should have had a plan, a clear strategy for what we were going to do. There was no unity, no purpose. It was just emotions and anger driving us. That's all we created over there - more anger.\n\nI don't think we're the ones to change them. They're always going to be like that. It's been too long, and we're not making enough progress. We've made some, sure, but not enough to justify staying.  We can't stay there forever. We're just hurting ourselves."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmmm...I think the Catholic Church needs to catch up with the times in some ways. \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things.  Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  It's okay to have strong beliefs, but some of their views seem stuck in the past.  \n\nIf they were a little more open-minded, they might not worry so much about losing people.  I've heard that lots of folks are turning away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that says it's always wrong.  Or if you support gay marriage, you might feel out of place in a church that doesn't.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have women priests or allow priests to get married.  It's like, everyone else has a job and a family life, so why not priests?  They claim priests are \"married\" to God, but I think it's possible to be devoted to God and have a family too.",
            "Hmm...so, about gay marriage, I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you choose, right? So, I feel like gay people shouldn't have to deal with being judged for who they are. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but honestly, it just seems wrong to me.  \n\nIt's like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It's just how we are, you know?  It's not like they made a choice to be that way.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not a legal or moral issue, really.  It's not like they did something wrong. It's just who they are. It's not right to make them feel like they're different or that they made the wrong choice.\n\nIt's just not their place to interfere in people's lives like that.",
            "You know, I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's just no strong reason against it. Many folks worry that same-sex couples will somehow threaten \"traditional\" families, but it's not like that at all. It's like comparing apples and oranges, they're different, but still part of the same fruit basket.  \n\nThere are tons of rights involved, like with taxes, healthcare, and all that.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be there for you in the hospital if you're sick. They can't even visit!  It's crazy because if you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and successful as straight ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.\n\nSometimes people get hung up on the religious aspects, but gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, just a legal marriage certificate from the government.  It's like separating church and state, you know? \n\nI don't get why some religions are so against it. It's like saying, \"Our religion says no to this, so it should be illegal for everyone.\" That's not fair! If you're allowing civil unions, why not full marriage? It's like segregation – treating people differently just because they're different.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how gay couples will raise kids, but studies show they're just as good at it as straight couples. It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.\n\nHonestly, the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about time we all had equal rights.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you, working at the hospital pharmacy this summer, you realize some things. Just because something's illegal, doesn't mean it's totally bad. I mean, should we just make everything illegal?  I don't think so.  \n\nI get it, making drugs available to everyone might be a problem.  But, for medical reasons? Sure, why not?\n\nThere are tons of drugs that are illegal but we use them in the pharmacy all the time.  Like, oxycontin, Vicodin, percocet...those are serious drugs, controlled substances, but they help people.  If we're going to deny the good that marijuana can do just because it's considered taboo, that doesn't make sense to me.  We should look at the benefits, you know?\n\nAlcohol's different, I guess, but even then, if you abuse it, it can cause problems. Marijuana, it's a bit tricky.  Maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just jump right in.  That way, people can learn to use it responsibly.\n\nIt's all about the image people have of marijuana. It's illegal, so they think it's bad, right? But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we could change how people see it, maybe they'd use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "You know, I think churches have definitely changed to fit with modern times. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was younger, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd wear cute dresses and matching shoes and purses – the whole nine yards! I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too.  But now, things are different. They have a special mass just for teenagers, and it's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people coming straight from the beach! Even at the morning masses, where I always used to dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis now. It's definitely more relaxed.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other things going on in the church, I'm not really involved in the politics of it all.\n\nOh, and about those accusations against priests... I don't think allowing priests to get married would have stopped that. There are married men who become pedophiles too, so it's not about being married or not. I think it's more about the person themselves. \n\nSome religions allow their leaders to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" The main character was a minister, and he was married. So if someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion.",
            "I'm not really okay with how the Iraq War started. It felt like everyone was still shaken up by 9/11, and the government used that fear to justify going to war. They kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turns out that was all a lie. It makes me so angry that they tricked the American people like that.  \n\nEven Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious betrayal of the public trust. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration doesn't care about the Constitution at all. They've been trying to ignore it since 9/11.  I think they went into office wanting to go to war, and maybe even with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  \n\nIt's also suspicious that they wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause chaos and more deaths, but sending other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia in to try and fix things doesn't seem like a good solution either.  \n\nIt's a mess. The Iraqi government isn't working. The Prime Minister doesn't have much power, and people like Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, are now in Parliament. There are so many different groups fighting for control. It's hard to see a way out of this.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you how I feel about the war in Iraq. Honestly, I think it's kind of pointless at this point. I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? It feels like it was just a way for us to get back at Iraq because they were blamed for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're just staying there to build democracy and get access to their oil. But staying there is causing a lot of problems and making people angry.\n\nIt's a struggle because if we leave, they might be upset because things are messed up and they'll have to start over.  But if we stay, it'll take forever to create a democracy, and it might make them even more resentful.\n\nIt's a real dilemma. I don't know what the right answer is.\n\nI guess I feel like we should be helping them, but it's also a waste of resources. And honestly, it's making President Bush look bad, making people think of him like the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nIt's tough because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to come home safe, but it feels like we've already caused a lot of damage.\n\nThe people in Iraq have their own culture and beliefs, and it feels like we're trying to force them into something that isn't theirs. It's like we're trying to make them into a second United States, which probably wouldn't be good for them.\n\nI think this whole war is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really complicated.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal... I just don't feel it's right. It's like, the constitution says there should be a separation between church and state, and that's pretty clear, you know? Trying to make it legal, trying to force it, feels like going against what's already written down.\n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are picking sides, choosing one church's beliefs over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston.  But who are we to tell the churches what they can and can't say is wrong or right?\n\nSeparation of church and state is important, it's about letting people practice their religion freely.  Even if they try to make an amendment, it feels wrong. It's like they're trying to limit people instead of the government. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved at all. It seems like this guy pushing for the amendment is just trying to impose his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't help the economy or anything. Maybe it would even be good for society.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq...I don't think the government was totally straight with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to connect the Iraq War to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really linked that strongly.  But they played on everyone's feelings of anger after 9/11, and that's how the war started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one just because we're scared. It feels like the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War in a lot of ways, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made then.  \n\nA ton of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The government didn't seem prepared for what would happen after they removed Saddam Hussein's government – the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They basically took out the Iraqi government and tried to put in a democracy, just like they tried to do in Vietnam, pushing out communists and trying to impose democracy.  \n\nThe US government should have known that it would be a long, hard fight. It wasn't going to be a quick, clear victory, like some people hoped. It feels more like a loss, like Vietnam, because no matter how many people want the US to be there, there will always be people who resist.  It's tough to fight against a whole population, not just a formal army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up in a lot of ways. First, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. And if they had, they should have been more prepared for the consequences. They didn't plan for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government, and we're still there in 2006, with American soldiers still dying, and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a slow process, and I think the US government made it seem like it would be much easier.\n\nChanging a whole government and country is a huge deal, just look at our own history! It took a long time to become the democratic nation we are today, with lots of struggles and even civil war. It's not something that happens overnight. The US government made it sound simple, but it's not.\n\nAnd then there's the whole question of why we're in Iraq in the first place. If we're going to make a country democratic, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this for other countries too? I think it has to do with oil. It's always about money and resources.\n\nRemember when they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction? They never found any! But places like North Korea, where we know they have weapons of mass destruction, we're not going to war with them. So, I don't think the US government is being honest or thorough in their decisions.\n\nAll I can hope for is peace in Iraq soon. But honestly, I don't think it will come anytime soon.",
            "Hmm, let me tell you, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been. You know, it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it's a natural part of who someone is, not something they choose. It just feels wrong to take away people's rights because of something they can't control.  \n\nHonestly, it feels really unfair. I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  \n\nPolitics and the government shouldn't be involved in this at all. It's a personal matter, something between two people. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs, doing normal things.  \n\nIt's upsetting to see people like Bush trying to decide what marriage means. It's their personal lives, not his place to judge. \n\nIt seems like science is even proving that being gay is something you're born with, a natural part of who you are, not something you learn. It's about chemistry in the brain, not about growing up with siblings or parents.  \n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just go to Vegas and do it. No one even bats an eye. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal, front-page news. It shouldn't be like that. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone else is entitled to know about.",
            "Okay, so listen up.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can hear it!  As someone who works with people, I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nWhat you post online can totally change how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or even shootings, someone is going to take notice.  You can't just put that stuff out there and expect it to disappear. The internet is everywhere.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nSchools have to be careful because someone might see something scary online and tell them. They can't just ignore it, because what if something bad happens? They have to investigate.\n\nBut sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's real and what's not. Maybe it's just a prank gone wrong, like a sociology project. Or maybe it's something serious.  I know one time someone made a joke online that got them in big trouble.  It was something harmless at first, but because of the situation, it became really serious.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you don't want something out there, don't post it.  You can't control what people think, but you can control what you share. Schools may have to look at what's online if someone tells them about something concerning.  It's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared that information. \n\nIt's important for teachers and school officials to respect students' privacy. They shouldn't be snooping through their social media accounts. But if something dangerous is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war, it's been going on for way too long. I think at first, it had a good goal, to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But now, it feels like we've forgotten that reason. Maybe we're just fighting to show everyone how powerful we are. I wonder if the reasons we started were even good to begin with, with all the old problems between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein.  If the point was to help a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons mixed in, that wouldn't be right. This war has dragged on for ages, though. We made our point those first few months, that was enough.  But now it's been years, and it just seems pointless. If we wanted to give democracy to people under a bad leader, that's a good reason to fight. But it feels like our purpose has gotten messed up over time. We're still fighting like we need to win, even though I don't think that's the point anymore.  It's been long enough. Their government needs to figure things out on its own. We've been spending billions and billions, money that could be better used right here at home. We have problems with poverty, roads, schools, and healthcare. We should be taking care of those things first. It's just not right to keep sending money to a war we've lost sight of. We're even hurting our own people with this. They're getting killed in a war that doesn't make sense anymore.",
            "Someone was asking if it's okay that someone found something on MySpace and stopped something bad from happening. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, because if you put something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. On MySpace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.  Anything you put on the internet, lots of people will probably see it. So maybe it was good that someone saw it and could prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tricky though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time. And it wouldn't be fair to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for something specific? I don't know.\n\nIt does bother me that creepy people can see things about me on Facebook, even though I don't have MySpace. I saw a story on TV about a guy who got someone's screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in less than a minute and got them to meet him. I definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes IM me even though I don't recognize their screen names. It's scary because they know things about me, like my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, my friends. They can see lots of photos. I try to be careful about what I put up, but I also want to be able to connect with friends. It's a tough balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who's really looking at what.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned MySpace, which seemed strange to me. I don't know if it's a privacy issue, but I think it's weird that school officials can tell students they can't have MySpace.",
            "Hmm...this Iraq War thing...it's tough to talk about, you know? I feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon, saying I was against it from the start. But honestly, it just feels wrong to have been involved in the first place.  It seems like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for the people who made it happen. They don't want to admit they were wrong. \n\nSeriously, look at the polls: 75-80% of people worldwide think it was a mistake, even most of the US troops there. They want us out within the year.  It's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be a mess too.  It's like quicksand - we just can't seem to get out of it.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's just a clash of cultures.  The US and the Middle East are so different.  It's like trying to force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  Sure, Saddam was bad, but invading a country and expecting everything to be fine afterwards... that's just not how it works.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there anymore. The people who live there want us out, and they might just know what's best for their country.  If we ask them and they say leave, then at least it's not on us if things go wrong.  We can say we tried to help, but they decided not to accept it.\n\nMaybe that would make us look a little better, even if we'll never truly be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "Okay, so I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  \n\nIt's not just about women, though. I feel like it depends a lot on what kind of work you do. \n\nFor women, there's this invisible barrier, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  A lot of times, guys struggle with having a woman as their boss because of how society has always been.  So, a woman might be totally qualified for a promotion, but the board might not pick her because traditionally, women aren't seen as being in charge in business.\n\nAnd it's kinda the same for guys, too. Like, in fields like fashion or even being a stay-at-home parent, it's not super common to see men do those things. Society kind of looks down on it, thinking, \"Oh, you're the guy, you should be out working, making money!\" But maybe a guy really wants to be with his kids and help raise them, and his wife has the better job. It's a tough situation because what works for them might not fit society's expectations.\n\nAnd in fashion, guys who are straight sometimes get treated differently. I don't know if this makes sense, but I think it's because people assume guys into fashion have a certain type of lifestyle, so they might wonder if a straight guy really \"gets\" fashion the way a woman does.\n\nSo, it really depends on the field. I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society, but it's slow to change.  We've made progress, with women becoming CEOs and more accepted in business, and stay-at-home dads becoming more common.  People are starting to get it, but it takes time. Maybe we just need to keep showing people the good qualities of those who are stereotyped and not be too pushy about it. If we force it, people might resist.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just made it so it's not a crime anymore.\n\nThink of it like a parking ticket, you know? Instead of getting arrested and all that drama, you just get a citation. \n\nBut even though it's not a criminal offense, it can still mess with folks.  Like, if you get caught, it could still pop up during job interviews and stuff. It might not be as bad as a full-blown drug charge, but it's still something you gotta worry about.\n\nSome folks are worried about what this means for the future, too. Like, will it really change things?\n\nOn the other hand, it costs a ton of money to arrest and prosecute people for marijuana.  Think about all the court appearances, lawyers, and jail time.\n\nSome towns are struggling financially, and they're thinking, \"Hey, maybe we can save some money if we just decriminalize it.\"\n\nBut there are also places where folks are really against marijuana, even if it means saving money.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, is more open to it. They probably have more cash now to spend on good things like schools and helping the less fortunate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. You don't want marijuana to be everywhere, but you also don't want to waste money locking people up for it.\n\nPersonally, I think it's better than having people get in serious trouble over it.",
            "Hmmm...Catholics, right? I guess there are good things about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, which can be comforting. But sometimes, you know, it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't want to change.  They're super strict about going to church every week and doing things their way. It's like they judge people who don't follow every single rule perfectly. And they don't really accept people who aren't exactly like them, like people from other religions. \n\nMy parents are a good example. My mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church wouldn't let them get married because of my dad's religion.  It just seems hypocritical to preach about loving everyone but then not accept people who are different.\n\nI mean, maybe allowing priests to get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from doing bad stuff. You know, like the whole child abuse thing. It's a separate issue, like, even if they had wives, they might still do those things. People who hurt children, they're probably going to hurt children no matter what.",
            "Hmm... This whole thing about marriage is really confusing. I haven't figured out what I think yet.  It's hard to say who's right or wrong because it's such a tough topic. It's like a tightrope walk between separating religion and government, and figuring out what marriage really means without hurting anyone's feelings.  I don't know, maybe all marriages should just be treated as civil unions, no matter who's getting married. Like, the government shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not. Just two people coming together. It's like, if you're baptized, the government doesn't get involved, right? So why should they care about marriage?\n\nIf everyone could agree on a fair way to handle it, maybe they could make it a national law. But trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's crazy! It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to change the Constitution. It's just not that important.",
            "Ugh, this whole homosexuality thing is a tough one for me. I grew up Christian, so it's kinda like a gray area.  I've got lots of gay friends, you know?  I don't really agree with the lifestyle, but hey, I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a huge national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a call for the whole country.\n\nLike, think about it, some states are super liberal, others are more conservative.  The liberal states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you live there, you gotta respect their decision, right? You kinda chose to live there, knowing what their views are.\n\nLook, I just think everyone deserves the same chances, gay or straight. So, I think legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already said it, but I don't think Bush should be able to tell the whole country what to do about gay marriage. It should be up to each state to decide.  I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to control how things are run there. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth.  It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with it, not the president.",
            "Okay, so basically, Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right?  Anything you post there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So if school officials see something on there, it's not really a surprise. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut if they find something that could prevent a school shooting, I think that's totally okay.  Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then it's worth it.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy. \n\nBut if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, like a threat of violence, then I don't think it's wrong for them to look.\n\nThink about it:  parents trust schools to keep their kids safe. We all want to feel safe at school.  \n\nJust like we have drills for emergencies, checking Myspace could be another way to keep everyone safe.  It's like making sure the school is a secure place, just like after those awful shootings happened.",
            "You know, at first I was totally on board with the war. Nine Eleven hit me hard, personally. I wanted revenge, to make those guys pay for what they did here. Looking back, though, I think we were all so caught up in the emotion of it all that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a clear plan, and it just backfired.\n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. Honestly, I think those people are too busy fighting amongst themselves to worry about us.  It's like, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nNine Eleven really changed my feelings about that whole region. I just don't care what happens over there anymore. Sometimes I even wonder if they're truly human. They're always fighting, always causing chaos.\n\nWe went in blind, didn't know what to expect. War's different there, much more savage. They're not fighting for their country, they're fighting to push us out. Maybe that's what we should do, just leave.  \n\nI think we were just driven by anger and a thirst for revenge, not a clear strategy. President Bush probably felt pressured by the people, but I don't think declaring war on Iraq was the right move.\n\nSure, we couldn't just ignore what happened, but we should have had a better plan. There wasn't any unity, no clear purpose. We went in there hoping to create order, but it just made things worse.\n\nWe probably can't change those people anyway. They're stuck in their ways, and I don't think any amount of time will change that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there. It's just hurting us more than anything."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmmm...I think the Catholic Church needs to catch up with the times in some ways. \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things.  Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  It's okay to have strong beliefs, but some of their views seem stuck in the past.  \n\nIf they were a little more open-minded, they might not worry so much about losing people.  I've heard that lots of folks are turning away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that says it's always wrong.  Or if you support gay marriage, you might feel out of place in a church that doesn't.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have women priests or allow priests to get married.  It's like, everyone else has a job and a family life, so why not priests?  They claim priests are \"married\" to God, but I think it's possible to be devoted to God and have a family too.",
            "Hmm...so, about gay marriage, I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you choose, right? So, I feel like gay people shouldn't have to deal with being judged for who they are. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but honestly, it just seems wrong to me.  \n\nIt's like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It's just how we are, you know?  It's not like they made a choice to be that way.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not a legal or moral issue, really.  It's not like they did something wrong. It's just who they are. It's not right to make them feel like they're different or that they made the wrong choice.\n\nIt's just not their place to interfere in people's lives like that.",
            "You know, I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's just no strong reason against it. Many folks worry that same-sex couples will somehow threaten \"traditional\" families, but it's not like that at all. It's like comparing apples and oranges, they're different, but still part of the same fruit basket.  \n\nThere are tons of rights involved, like with taxes, healthcare, and all that.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be there for you in the hospital if you're sick. They can't even visit!  It's crazy because if you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and successful as straight ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.\n\nSometimes people get hung up on the religious aspects, but gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, just a legal marriage certificate from the government.  It's like separating church and state, you know? \n\nI don't get why some religions are so against it. It's like saying, \"Our religion says no to this, so it should be illegal for everyone.\" That's not fair! If you're allowing civil unions, why not full marriage? It's like segregation – treating people differently just because they're different.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how gay couples will raise kids, but studies show they're just as good at it as straight couples. It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.\n\nHonestly, the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about time we all had equal rights.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you, working at the hospital pharmacy this summer, you realize some things. Just because something's illegal, doesn't mean it's totally bad. I mean, should we just make everything illegal?  I don't think so.  \n\nI get it, making drugs available to everyone might be a problem.  But, for medical reasons? Sure, why not?\n\nThere are tons of drugs that are illegal but we use them in the pharmacy all the time.  Like, oxycontin, Vicodin, percocet...those are serious drugs, controlled substances, but they help people.  If we're going to deny the good that marijuana can do just because it's considered taboo, that doesn't make sense to me.  We should look at the benefits, you know?\n\nAlcohol's different, I guess, but even then, if you abuse it, it can cause problems. Marijuana, it's a bit tricky.  Maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just jump right in.  That way, people can learn to use it responsibly.\n\nIt's all about the image people have of marijuana. It's illegal, so they think it's bad, right? But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we could change how people see it, maybe they'd use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "You know, I think churches have definitely changed to fit with modern times. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was younger, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd wear cute dresses and matching shoes and purses – the whole nine yards! I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too.  But now, things are different. They have a special mass just for teenagers, and it's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people coming straight from the beach! Even at the morning masses, where I always used to dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis now. It's definitely more relaxed.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other things going on in the church, I'm not really involved in the politics of it all.\n\nOh, and about those accusations against priests... I don't think allowing priests to get married would have stopped that. There are married men who become pedophiles too, so it's not about being married or not. I think it's more about the person themselves. \n\nSome religions allow their leaders to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" The main character was a minister, and he was married. So if someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion.",
            "I'm not really okay with how the Iraq War started. It felt like everyone was still shaken up by 9/11, and the government used that fear to justify going to war. They kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turns out that was all a lie. It makes me so angry that they tricked the American people like that.  \n\nEven Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious betrayal of the public trust. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration doesn't care about the Constitution at all. They've been trying to ignore it since 9/11.  I think they went into office wanting to go to war, and maybe even with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  \n\nIt's also suspicious that they wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause chaos and more deaths, but sending other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia in to try and fix things doesn't seem like a good solution either.  \n\nIt's a mess. The Iraqi government isn't working. The Prime Minister doesn't have much power, and people like Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, are now in Parliament. There are so many different groups fighting for control. It's hard to see a way out of this.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you how I feel about the war in Iraq. Honestly, I think it's kind of pointless at this point. I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? It feels like it was just a way for us to get back at Iraq because they were blamed for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're just staying there to build democracy and get access to their oil. But staying there is causing a lot of problems and making people angry.\n\nIt's a struggle because if we leave, they might be upset because things are messed up and they'll have to start over.  But if we stay, it'll take forever to create a democracy, and it might make them even more resentful.\n\nIt's a real dilemma. I don't know what the right answer is.\n\nI guess I feel like we should be helping them, but it's also a waste of resources. And honestly, it's making President Bush look bad, making people think of him like the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nIt's tough because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to come home safe, but it feels like we've already caused a lot of damage.\n\nThe people in Iraq have their own culture and beliefs, and it feels like we're trying to force them into something that isn't theirs. It's like we're trying to make them into a second United States, which probably wouldn't be good for them.\n\nI think this whole war is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really complicated.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal... I just don't feel it's right. It's like, the constitution says there should be a separation between church and state, and that's pretty clear, you know? Trying to make it legal, trying to force it, feels like going against what's already written down.\n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are picking sides, choosing one church's beliefs over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston.  But who are we to tell the churches what they can and can't say is wrong or right?\n\nSeparation of church and state is important, it's about letting people practice their religion freely.  Even if they try to make an amendment, it feels wrong. It's like they're trying to limit people instead of the government. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved at all. It seems like this guy pushing for the amendment is just trying to impose his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't help the economy or anything. Maybe it would even be good for society.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq...I don't think the government was totally straight with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to connect the Iraq War to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really linked that strongly.  But they played on everyone's feelings of anger after 9/11, and that's how the war started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one just because we're scared. It feels like the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War in a lot of ways, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made then.  \n\nA ton of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The government didn't seem prepared for what would happen after they removed Saddam Hussein's government – the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They basically took out the Iraqi government and tried to put in a democracy, just like they tried to do in Vietnam, pushing out communists and trying to impose democracy.  \n\nThe US government should have known that it would be a long, hard fight. It wasn't going to be a quick, clear victory, like some people hoped. It feels more like a loss, like Vietnam, because no matter how many people want the US to be there, there will always be people who resist.  It's tough to fight against a whole population, not just a formal army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up in a lot of ways. First, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. And if they had, they should have been more prepared for the consequences. They didn't plan for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government, and we're still there in 2006, with American soldiers still dying, and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a slow process, and I think the US government made it seem like it would be much easier.\n\nChanging a whole government and country is a huge deal, just look at our own history! It took a long time to become the democratic nation we are today, with lots of struggles and even civil war. It's not something that happens overnight. The US government made it sound simple, but it's not.\n\nAnd then there's the whole question of why we're in Iraq in the first place. If we're going to make a country democratic, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this for other countries too? I think it has to do with oil. It's always about money and resources.\n\nRemember when they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction? They never found any! But places like North Korea, where we know they have weapons of mass destruction, we're not going to war with them. So, I don't think the US government is being honest or thorough in their decisions.\n\nAll I can hope for is peace in Iraq soon. But honestly, I don't think it will come anytime soon.",
            "Hmm, let me tell you, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been. You know, it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it's a natural part of who someone is, not something they choose. It just feels wrong to take away people's rights because of something they can't control.  \n\nHonestly, it feels really unfair. I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  \n\nPolitics and the government shouldn't be involved in this at all. It's a personal matter, something between two people. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs, doing normal things.  \n\nIt's upsetting to see people like Bush trying to decide what marriage means. It's their personal lives, not his place to judge. \n\nIt seems like science is even proving that being gay is something you're born with, a natural part of who you are, not something you learn. It's about chemistry in the brain, not about growing up with siblings or parents.  \n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just go to Vegas and do it. No one even bats an eye. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal, front-page news. It shouldn't be like that. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone else is entitled to know about.",
            "Okay, so listen up.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can hear it!  As someone who works with people, I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nWhat you post online can totally change how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or even shootings, someone is going to take notice.  You can't just put that stuff out there and expect it to disappear. The internet is everywhere.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nSchools have to be careful because someone might see something scary online and tell them. They can't just ignore it, because what if something bad happens? They have to investigate.\n\nBut sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's real and what's not. Maybe it's just a prank gone wrong, like a sociology project. Or maybe it's something serious.  I know one time someone made a joke online that got them in big trouble.  It was something harmless at first, but because of the situation, it became really serious.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you don't want something out there, don't post it.  You can't control what people think, but you can control what you share. Schools may have to look at what's online if someone tells them about something concerning.  It's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared that information. \n\nIt's important for teachers and school officials to respect students' privacy. They shouldn't be snooping through their social media accounts. But if something dangerous is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war, it's been going on for way too long. I think at first, it had a good goal, to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But now, it feels like we've forgotten that reason. Maybe we're just fighting to show everyone how powerful we are. I wonder if the reasons we started were even good to begin with, with all the old problems between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein.  If the point was to help a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons mixed in, that wouldn't be right. This war has dragged on for ages, though. We made our point those first few months, that was enough.  But now it's been years, and it just seems pointless. If we wanted to give democracy to people under a bad leader, that's a good reason to fight. But it feels like our purpose has gotten messed up over time. We're still fighting like we need to win, even though I don't think that's the point anymore.  It's been long enough. Their government needs to figure things out on its own. We've been spending billions and billions, money that could be better used right here at home. We have problems with poverty, roads, schools, and healthcare. We should be taking care of those things first. It's just not right to keep sending money to a war we've lost sight of. We're even hurting our own people with this. They're getting killed in a war that doesn't make sense anymore.",
            "Someone was asking if it's okay that someone found something on MySpace and stopped something bad from happening. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, because if you put something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. On MySpace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.  Anything you put on the internet, lots of people will probably see it. So maybe it was good that someone saw it and could prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tricky though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time. And it wouldn't be fair to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for something specific? I don't know.\n\nIt does bother me that creepy people can see things about me on Facebook, even though I don't have MySpace. I saw a story on TV about a guy who got someone's screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in less than a minute and got them to meet him. I definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes IM me even though I don't recognize their screen names. It's scary because they know things about me, like my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, my friends. They can see lots of photos. I try to be careful about what I put up, but I also want to be able to connect with friends. It's a tough balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who's really looking at what.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned MySpace, which seemed strange to me. I don't know if it's a privacy issue, but I think it's weird that school officials can tell students they can't have MySpace.",
            "Hmm...this Iraq War thing...it's tough to talk about, you know? I feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon, saying I was against it from the start. But honestly, it just feels wrong to have been involved in the first place.  It seems like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for the people who made it happen. They don't want to admit they were wrong. \n\nSeriously, look at the polls: 75-80% of people worldwide think it was a mistake, even most of the US troops there. They want us out within the year.  It's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be a mess too.  It's like quicksand - we just can't seem to get out of it.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's just a clash of cultures.  The US and the Middle East are so different.  It's like trying to force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  Sure, Saddam was bad, but invading a country and expecting everything to be fine afterwards... that's just not how it works.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there anymore. The people who live there want us out, and they might just know what's best for their country.  If we ask them and they say leave, then at least it's not on us if things go wrong.  We can say we tried to help, but they decided not to accept it.\n\nMaybe that would make us look a little better, even if we'll never truly be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "Okay, so I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  \n\nIt's not just about women, though. I feel like it depends a lot on what kind of work you do. \n\nFor women, there's this invisible barrier, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  A lot of times, guys struggle with having a woman as their boss because of how society has always been.  So, a woman might be totally qualified for a promotion, but the board might not pick her because traditionally, women aren't seen as being in charge in business.\n\nAnd it's kinda the same for guys, too. Like, in fields like fashion or even being a stay-at-home parent, it's not super common to see men do those things. Society kind of looks down on it, thinking, \"Oh, you're the guy, you should be out working, making money!\" But maybe a guy really wants to be with his kids and help raise them, and his wife has the better job. It's a tough situation because what works for them might not fit society's expectations.\n\nAnd in fashion, guys who are straight sometimes get treated differently. I don't know if this makes sense, but I think it's because people assume guys into fashion have a certain type of lifestyle, so they might wonder if a straight guy really \"gets\" fashion the way a woman does.\n\nSo, it really depends on the field. I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society, but it's slow to change.  We've made progress, with women becoming CEOs and more accepted in business, and stay-at-home dads becoming more common.  People are starting to get it, but it takes time. Maybe we just need to keep showing people the good qualities of those who are stereotyped and not be too pushy about it. If we force it, people might resist.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just made it so it's not a crime anymore.\n\nThink of it like a parking ticket, you know? Instead of getting arrested and all that drama, you just get a citation. \n\nBut even though it's not a criminal offense, it can still mess with folks.  Like, if you get caught, it could still pop up during job interviews and stuff. It might not be as bad as a full-blown drug charge, but it's still something you gotta worry about.\n\nSome folks are worried about what this means for the future, too. Like, will it really change things?\n\nOn the other hand, it costs a ton of money to arrest and prosecute people for marijuana.  Think about all the court appearances, lawyers, and jail time.\n\nSome towns are struggling financially, and they're thinking, \"Hey, maybe we can save some money if we just decriminalize it.\"\n\nBut there are also places where folks are really against marijuana, even if it means saving money.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, is more open to it. They probably have more cash now to spend on good things like schools and helping the less fortunate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. You don't want marijuana to be everywhere, but you also don't want to waste money locking people up for it.\n\nPersonally, I think it's better than having people get in serious trouble over it.",
            "Hmmm...Catholics, right? I guess there are good things about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, which can be comforting. But sometimes, you know, it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't want to change.  They're super strict about going to church every week and doing things their way. It's like they judge people who don't follow every single rule perfectly. And they don't really accept people who aren't exactly like them, like people from other religions. \n\nMy parents are a good example. My mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church wouldn't let them get married because of my dad's religion.  It just seems hypocritical to preach about loving everyone but then not accept people who are different.\n\nI mean, maybe allowing priests to get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from doing bad stuff. You know, like the whole child abuse thing. It's a separate issue, like, even if they had wives, they might still do those things. People who hurt children, they're probably going to hurt children no matter what.",
            "Hmm... This whole thing about marriage is really confusing. I haven't figured out what I think yet.  It's hard to say who's right or wrong because it's such a tough topic. It's like a tightrope walk between separating religion and government, and figuring out what marriage really means without hurting anyone's feelings.  I don't know, maybe all marriages should just be treated as civil unions, no matter who's getting married. Like, the government shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not. Just two people coming together. It's like, if you're baptized, the government doesn't get involved, right? So why should they care about marriage?\n\nIf everyone could agree on a fair way to handle it, maybe they could make it a national law. But trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's crazy! It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to change the Constitution. It's just not that important.",
            "Ugh, this whole homosexuality thing is a tough one for me. I grew up Christian, so it's kinda like a gray area.  I've got lots of gay friends, you know?  I don't really agree with the lifestyle, but hey, I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a huge national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a call for the whole country.\n\nLike, think about it, some states are super liberal, others are more conservative.  The liberal states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you live there, you gotta respect their decision, right? You kinda chose to live there, knowing what their views are.\n\nLook, I just think everyone deserves the same chances, gay or straight. So, I think legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already said it, but I don't think Bush should be able to tell the whole country what to do about gay marriage. It should be up to each state to decide.  I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to control how things are run there. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth.  It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with it, not the president.",
            "Okay, so basically, Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right?  Anything you post there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So if school officials see something on there, it's not really a surprise. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut if they find something that could prevent a school shooting, I think that's totally okay.  Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then it's worth it.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy. \n\nBut if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, like a threat of violence, then I don't think it's wrong for them to look.\n\nThink about it:  parents trust schools to keep their kids safe. We all want to feel safe at school.  \n\nJust like we have drills for emergencies, checking Myspace could be another way to keep everyone safe.  It's like making sure the school is a secure place, just like after those awful shootings happened.",
            "You know, at first I was totally on board with the war. Nine Eleven hit me hard, personally. I wanted revenge, to make those guys pay for what they did here. Looking back, though, I think we were all so caught up in the emotion of it all that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a clear plan, and it just backfired.\n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. Honestly, I think those people are too busy fighting amongst themselves to worry about us.  It's like, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nNine Eleven really changed my feelings about that whole region. I just don't care what happens over there anymore. Sometimes I even wonder if they're truly human. They're always fighting, always causing chaos.\n\nWe went in blind, didn't know what to expect. War's different there, much more savage. They're not fighting for their country, they're fighting to push us out. Maybe that's what we should do, just leave.  \n\nI think we were just driven by anger and a thirst for revenge, not a clear strategy. President Bush probably felt pressured by the people, but I don't think declaring war on Iraq was the right move.\n\nSure, we couldn't just ignore what happened, but we should have had a better plan. There wasn't any unity, no clear purpose. We went in there hoping to create order, but it just made things worse.\n\nWe probably can't change those people anyway. They're stuck in their ways, and I don't think any amount of time will change that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there. It's just hurting us more than anything."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Hmmm...I think the Catholic Church needs to catch up with the times in some ways. \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things.  Like, they're super against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  It's okay to have strong beliefs, but some of their views seem stuck in the past.  \n\nIf they were a little more open-minded, they might not worry so much about losing people.  I've heard that lots of folks are turning away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a church that says it's always wrong.  Or if you support gay marriage, you might feel out of place in a church that doesn't.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have women priests or allow priests to get married.  It's like, everyone else has a job and a family life, so why not priests?  They claim priests are \"married\" to God, but I think it's possible to be devoted to God and have a family too.",
            "Hmm...so, about gay marriage, I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not something you choose, right? So, I feel like gay people shouldn't have to deal with being judged for who they are. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but honestly, it just seems wrong to me.  \n\nIt's like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It's just how we are, you know?  It's not like they made a choice to be that way.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved either. It's not a legal or moral issue, really.  It's not like they did something wrong. It's just who they are. It's not right to make them feel like they're different or that they made the wrong choice.\n\nIt's just not their place to interfere in people's lives like that.",
            "You know, I truly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Honestly, there's just no strong reason against it. Many folks worry that same-sex couples will somehow threaten \"traditional\" families, but it's not like that at all. It's like comparing apples and oranges, they're different, but still part of the same fruit basket.  \n\nThere are tons of rights involved, like with taxes, healthcare, and all that.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be there for you in the hospital if you're sick. They can't even visit!  It's crazy because if you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and successful as straight ones. They have the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.\n\nSometimes people get hung up on the religious aspects, but gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, just a legal marriage certificate from the government.  It's like separating church and state, you know? \n\nI don't get why some religions are so against it. It's like saying, \"Our religion says no to this, so it should be illegal for everyone.\" That's not fair! If you're allowing civil unions, why not full marriage? It's like segregation – treating people differently just because they're different.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how gay couples will raise kids, but studies show they're just as good at it as straight couples. It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.\n\nHonestly, the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about time we all had equal rights.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you, working at the hospital pharmacy this summer, you realize some things. Just because something's illegal, doesn't mean it's totally bad. I mean, should we just make everything illegal?  I don't think so.  \n\nI get it, making drugs available to everyone might be a problem.  But, for medical reasons? Sure, why not?\n\nThere are tons of drugs that are illegal but we use them in the pharmacy all the time.  Like, oxycontin, Vicodin, percocet...those are serious drugs, controlled substances, but they help people.  If we're going to deny the good that marijuana can do just because it's considered taboo, that doesn't make sense to me.  We should look at the benefits, you know?\n\nAlcohol's different, I guess, but even then, if you abuse it, it can cause problems. Marijuana, it's a bit tricky.  Maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just jump right in.  That way, people can learn to use it responsibly.\n\nIt's all about the image people have of marijuana. It's illegal, so they think it's bad, right? But it's not like heroin or cocaine. If we could change how people see it, maybe they'd use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "You know, I think churches have definitely changed to fit with modern times. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was younger, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd wear cute dresses and matching shoes and purses – the whole nine yards! I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too.  But now, things are different. They have a special mass just for teenagers, and it's only thirty minutes long. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. You'll see people coming straight from the beach! Even at the morning masses, where I always used to dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis now. It's definitely more relaxed.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for other things going on in the church, I'm not really involved in the politics of it all.\n\nOh, and about those accusations against priests... I don't think allowing priests to get married would have stopped that. There are married men who become pedophiles too, so it's not about being married or not. I think it's more about the person themselves. \n\nSome religions allow their leaders to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" The main character was a minister, and he was married. So if someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should consider a different religion.",
            "I'm not really okay with how the Iraq War started. It felt like everyone was still shaken up by 9/11, and the government used that fear to justify going to war. They kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turns out that was all a lie. It makes me so angry that they tricked the American people like that.  \n\nEven Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later that he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. To me, that's a serious betrayal of the public trust. \n\nIt feels like the Bush administration doesn't care about the Constitution at all. They've been trying to ignore it since 9/11.  I think they went into office wanting to go to war, and maybe even with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  \n\nIt's also suspicious that they wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would probably cause chaos and more deaths, but sending other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia in to try and fix things doesn't seem like a good solution either.  \n\nIt's a mess. The Iraqi government isn't working. The Prime Minister doesn't have much power, and people like Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not long ago, are now in Parliament. There are so many different groups fighting for control. It's hard to see a way out of this.",
            "Okay, so let me tell you how I feel about the war in Iraq. Honestly, I think it's kind of pointless at this point. I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? It feels like it was just a way for us to get back at Iraq because they were blamed for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're just staying there to build democracy and get access to their oil. But staying there is causing a lot of problems and making people angry.\n\nIt's a struggle because if we leave, they might be upset because things are messed up and they'll have to start over.  But if we stay, it'll take forever to create a democracy, and it might make them even more resentful.\n\nIt's a real dilemma. I don't know what the right answer is.\n\nI guess I feel like we should be helping them, but it's also a waste of resources. And honestly, it's making President Bush look bad, making people think of him like the president who started another pointless war, just like Vietnam.\n\nIt's tough because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to come home safe, but it feels like we've already caused a lot of damage.\n\nThe people in Iraq have their own culture and beliefs, and it feels like we're trying to force them into something that isn't theirs. It's like we're trying to make them into a second United States, which probably wouldn't be good for them.\n\nI think this whole war is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really complicated.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal... I just don't feel it's right. It's like, the constitution says there should be a separation between church and state, and that's pretty clear, you know? Trying to make it legal, trying to force it, feels like going against what's already written down.\n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are picking sides, choosing one church's beliefs over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston.  But who are we to tell the churches what they can and can't say is wrong or right?\n\nSeparation of church and state is important, it's about letting people practice their religion freely.  Even if they try to make an amendment, it feels wrong. It's like they're trying to limit people instead of the government. \n\nI don't think the government should be involved at all. It seems like this guy pushing for the amendment is just trying to impose his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't help the economy or anything. Maybe it would even be good for society.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq...I don't think the government was totally straight with the American people about why we went to war. Before invading, they tried to connect the Iraq War to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really linked that strongly.  But they played on everyone's feelings of anger after 9/11, and that's how the war started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one just because we're scared. It feels like the Iraq War is a repeat of the Vietnam War in a lot of ways, and the government should have learned from the mistakes they made then.  \n\nA ton of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The government didn't seem prepared for what would happen after they removed Saddam Hussein's government – the power vacuum and chaos that followed. They basically took out the Iraqi government and tried to put in a democracy, just like they tried to do in Vietnam, pushing out communists and trying to impose democracy.  \n\nThe US government should have known that it would be a long, hard fight. It wasn't going to be a quick, clear victory, like some people hoped. It feels more like a loss, like Vietnam, because no matter how many people want the US to be there, there will always be people who resist.  It's tough to fight against a whole population, not just a formal army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up in a lot of ways. First, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. And if they had, they should have been more prepared for the consequences. They didn't plan for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government, and we're still there in 2006, with American soldiers still dying, and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police. It's a slow process, and I think the US government made it seem like it would be much easier.\n\nChanging a whole government and country is a huge deal, just look at our own history! It took a long time to become the democratic nation we are today, with lots of struggles and even civil war. It's not something that happens overnight. The US government made it sound simple, but it's not.\n\nAnd then there's the whole question of why we're in Iraq in the first place. If we're going to make a country democratic, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this for other countries too? I think it has to do with oil. It's always about money and resources.\n\nRemember when they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction? They never found any! But places like North Korea, where we know they have weapons of mass destruction, we're not going to war with them. So, I don't think the US government is being honest or thorough in their decisions.\n\nAll I can hope for is peace in Iraq soon. But honestly, I don't think it will come anytime soon.",
            "Hmm, let me tell you, I'm totally for gay marriage. Always have been. You know, it's a personal choice, and it's becoming more and more clear that it's a natural part of who someone is, not something they choose. It just feels wrong to take away people's rights because of something they can't control.  \n\nHonestly, it feels really unfair. I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  \n\nPolitics and the government shouldn't be involved in this at all. It's a personal matter, something between two people. You know, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because they can't be. They live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs, doing normal things.  \n\nIt's upsetting to see people like Bush trying to decide what marriage means. It's their personal lives, not his place to judge. \n\nIt seems like science is even proving that being gay is something you're born with, a natural part of who you are, not something you learn. It's about chemistry in the brain, not about growing up with siblings or parents.  \n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just go to Vegas and do it. No one even bats an eye. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it's a huge deal, front-page news. It shouldn't be like that. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone else is entitled to know about.",
            "Okay, so listen up.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can hear it!  As someone who works with people, I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nWhat you post online can totally change how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or even shootings, someone is going to take notice.  You can't just put that stuff out there and expect it to disappear. The internet is everywhere.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, they'll see your posts.  \n\nSchools have to be careful because someone might see something scary online and tell them. They can't just ignore it, because what if something bad happens? They have to investigate.\n\nBut sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's real and what's not. Maybe it's just a prank gone wrong, like a sociology project. Or maybe it's something serious.  I know one time someone made a joke online that got them in big trouble.  It was something harmless at first, but because of the situation, it became really serious.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you don't want something out there, don't post it.  You can't control what people think, but you can control what you share. Schools may have to look at what's online if someone tells them about something concerning.  It's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared that information. \n\nIt's important for teachers and school officials to respect students' privacy. They shouldn't be snooping through their social media accounts. But if something dangerous is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war, it's been going on for way too long. I think at first, it had a good goal, to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But now, it feels like we've forgotten that reason. Maybe we're just fighting to show everyone how powerful we are. I wonder if the reasons we started were even good to begin with, with all the old problems between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein.  If the point was to help a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons mixed in, that wouldn't be right. This war has dragged on for ages, though. We made our point those first few months, that was enough.  But now it's been years, and it just seems pointless. If we wanted to give democracy to people under a bad leader, that's a good reason to fight. But it feels like our purpose has gotten messed up over time. We're still fighting like we need to win, even though I don't think that's the point anymore.  It's been long enough. Their government needs to figure things out on its own. We've been spending billions and billions, money that could be better used right here at home. We have problems with poverty, roads, schools, and healthcare. We should be taking care of those things first. It's just not right to keep sending money to a war we've lost sight of. We're even hurting our own people with this. They're getting killed in a war that doesn't make sense anymore.",
            "Someone was asking if it's okay that someone found something on MySpace and stopped something bad from happening. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, because if you put something on the internet, it's pretty much out there for everyone to see. On MySpace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.  Anything you put on the internet, lots of people will probably see it. So maybe it was good that someone saw it and could prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tricky though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time. And it wouldn't be fair to pick out \"bad\" kids to watch. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. It depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for something specific? I don't know.\n\nIt does bother me that creepy people can see things about me on Facebook, even though I don't have MySpace. I saw a story on TV about a guy who got someone's screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in less than a minute and got them to meet him. I definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes IM me even though I don't recognize their screen names. It's scary because they know things about me, like my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, my friends. They can see lots of photos. I try to be careful about what I put up, but I also want to be able to connect with friends. It's a tough balance. I only accept people I know, but you never know who's really looking at what.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned MySpace, which seemed strange to me. I don't know if it's a privacy issue, but I think it's weird that school officials can tell students they can't have MySpace.",
            "Hmm...this Iraq War thing...it's tough to talk about, you know? I feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon, saying I was against it from the start. But honestly, it just feels wrong to have been involved in the first place.  It seems like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for the people who made it happen. They don't want to admit they were wrong. \n\nSeriously, look at the polls: 75-80% of people worldwide think it was a mistake, even most of the US troops there. They want us out within the year.  It's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be a mess too.  It's like quicksand - we just can't seem to get out of it.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's just a clash of cultures.  The US and the Middle East are so different.  It's like trying to force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  Sure, Saddam was bad, but invading a country and expecting everything to be fine afterwards... that's just not how it works.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay there anymore. The people who live there want us out, and they might just know what's best for their country.  If we ask them and they say leave, then at least it's not on us if things go wrong.  We can say we tried to help, but they decided not to accept it.\n\nMaybe that would make us look a little better, even if we'll never truly be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "Okay, so I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  \n\nIt's not just about women, though. I feel like it depends a lot on what kind of work you do. \n\nFor women, there's this invisible barrier, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  A lot of times, guys struggle with having a woman as their boss because of how society has always been.  So, a woman might be totally qualified for a promotion, but the board might not pick her because traditionally, women aren't seen as being in charge in business.\n\nAnd it's kinda the same for guys, too. Like, in fields like fashion or even being a stay-at-home parent, it's not super common to see men do those things. Society kind of looks down on it, thinking, \"Oh, you're the guy, you should be out working, making money!\" But maybe a guy really wants to be with his kids and help raise them, and his wife has the better job. It's a tough situation because what works for them might not fit society's expectations.\n\nAnd in fashion, guys who are straight sometimes get treated differently. I don't know if this makes sense, but I think it's because people assume guys into fashion have a certain type of lifestyle, so they might wonder if a straight guy really \"gets\" fashion the way a woman does.\n\nSo, it really depends on the field. I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society, but it's slow to change.  We've made progress, with women becoming CEOs and more accepted in business, and stay-at-home dads becoming more common.  People are starting to get it, but it takes time. Maybe we just need to keep showing people the good qualities of those who are stereotyped and not be too pushy about it. If we force it, people might resist.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just made it so it's not a crime anymore.\n\nThink of it like a parking ticket, you know? Instead of getting arrested and all that drama, you just get a citation. \n\nBut even though it's not a criminal offense, it can still mess with folks.  Like, if you get caught, it could still pop up during job interviews and stuff. It might not be as bad as a full-blown drug charge, but it's still something you gotta worry about.\n\nSome folks are worried about what this means for the future, too. Like, will it really change things?\n\nOn the other hand, it costs a ton of money to arrest and prosecute people for marijuana.  Think about all the court appearances, lawyers, and jail time.\n\nSome towns are struggling financially, and they're thinking, \"Hey, maybe we can save some money if we just decriminalize it.\"\n\nBut there are also places where folks are really against marijuana, even if it means saving money.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, is more open to it. They probably have more cash now to spend on good things like schools and helping the less fortunate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. You don't want marijuana to be everywhere, but you also don't want to waste money locking people up for it.\n\nPersonally, I think it's better than having people get in serious trouble over it.",
            "Hmmm...Catholics, right? I guess there are good things about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, which can be comforting. But sometimes, you know, it feels like they're stuck in the past and don't want to change.  They're super strict about going to church every week and doing things their way. It's like they judge people who don't follow every single rule perfectly. And they don't really accept people who aren't exactly like them, like people from other religions. \n\nMy parents are a good example. My mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church wouldn't let them get married because of my dad's religion.  It just seems hypocritical to preach about loving everyone but then not accept people who are different.\n\nI mean, maybe allowing priests to get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from doing bad stuff. You know, like the whole child abuse thing. It's a separate issue, like, even if they had wives, they might still do those things. People who hurt children, they're probably going to hurt children no matter what.",
            "Hmm... This whole thing about marriage is really confusing. I haven't figured out what I think yet.  It's hard to say who's right or wrong because it's such a tough topic. It's like a tightrope walk between separating religion and government, and figuring out what marriage really means without hurting anyone's feelings.  I don't know, maybe all marriages should just be treated as civil unions, no matter who's getting married. Like, the government shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not. Just two people coming together. It's like, if you're baptized, the government doesn't get involved, right? So why should they care about marriage?\n\nIf everyone could agree on a fair way to handle it, maybe they could make it a national law. But trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's crazy! It's a big deal for some people, but not big enough to change the Constitution. It's just not that important.",
            "Ugh, this whole homosexuality thing is a tough one for me. I grew up Christian, so it's kinda like a gray area.  I've got lots of gay friends, you know?  I don't really agree with the lifestyle, but hey, I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a huge national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a call for the whole country.\n\nLike, think about it, some states are super liberal, others are more conservative.  The liberal states are gonna push for gay marriage, and if you live there, you gotta respect their decision, right? You kinda chose to live there, knowing what their views are.\n\nLook, I just think everyone deserves the same chances, gay or straight. So, I think legalizing it should be up to each state.\n\nI already said it, but I don't think Bush should be able to tell the whole country what to do about gay marriage. It should be up to each state to decide.  I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to control how things are run there. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth.  It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with it, not the president.",
            "Okay, so basically, Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right?  Anything you post there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So if school officials see something on there, it's not really a surprise. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they could still find it from home. \n\nBut if they find something that could prevent a school shooting, I think that's totally okay.  Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then it's worth it.\n\nIt's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing things they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy. \n\nBut if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, like a threat of violence, then I don't think it's wrong for them to look.\n\nThink about it:  parents trust schools to keep their kids safe. We all want to feel safe at school.  \n\nJust like we have drills for emergencies, checking Myspace could be another way to keep everyone safe.  It's like making sure the school is a secure place, just like after those awful shootings happened.",
            "You know, at first I was totally on board with the war. Nine Eleven hit me hard, personally. I wanted revenge, to make those guys pay for what they did here. Looking back, though, I think we were all so caught up in the emotion of it all that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a clear plan, and it just backfired.\n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. Honestly, I think those people are too busy fighting amongst themselves to worry about us.  It's like, if they can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?\n\nNine Eleven really changed my feelings about that whole region. I just don't care what happens over there anymore. Sometimes I even wonder if they're truly human. They're always fighting, always causing chaos.\n\nWe went in blind, didn't know what to expect. War's different there, much more savage. They're not fighting for their country, they're fighting to push us out. Maybe that's what we should do, just leave.  \n\nI think we were just driven by anger and a thirst for revenge, not a clear strategy. President Bush probably felt pressured by the people, but I don't think declaring war on Iraq was the right move.\n\nSure, we couldn't just ignore what happened, but we should have had a better plan. There wasn't any unity, no clear purpose. We went in there hoping to create order, but it just made things worse.\n\nWe probably can't change those people anyway. They're stuck in their ways, and I don't think any amount of time will change that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there. It's just hurting us more than anything."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "So, I think the Catholic Church needs to, like, update its views a bit. You know, people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not super accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions about these things, which is fine, but they seem a little stuck in the past to me. If they were more open to new ideas, maybe they wouldn't worry so much about losing people.\n\nI've heard some folks are starting to turn on the Church because of how they see these issues. People don't always agree with them anymore. For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that says it's completely wrong. \n\nSame goes for gay marriage or other things like that. If you support those things, you might not want to be in a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the recent scandals. It's hard to say for sure. \n\nI mean, even if priests were allowed to marry, would that have changed things? It's tough to know. But I think it's fair for priests to have both a job and a family life, just like everyone else.",
            "Okay, so, like, about gay marriage, I'm totally cool with it. I don't think it's something people choose, you know? It's just how they are.  Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay - it's just how life goes. It doesn't feel like a choice anyone makes, so it wouldn't be fair to judge them for it.  \n\nIt feels wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.  I haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems like it shouldn't be that way.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it's a security issue, or a big moral thing. It's just people wanting to be happy. It's not like the government should be telling people who they can and can't love.  It's their lives, you know?",
            "Okay, so I think gay marriage should totally be legal. I mean, seriously, what's the big deal? \n\nSome people freak out about gay couples messing up families, but it's just not the same thing. It's like comparing apples and oranges, you know? They're both fruit, but totally different.\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of rights that come with marriage, like taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's crazy! How can they not be considered family if they're spending their lives together?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples have just as much success in their relationships as straight couples. They have the same issues, the same joys, the same stuff. It's just love, right?\n\nHonestly, all the fuss about gay marriage being a religious issue doesn't make sense. They're not asking for a church wedding, just a legal document from the government.  It's like saying a civil union is okay, but a marriage isn't. That's just messed up.\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal.  They're the same relationship, just with different genders.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but that's just fear-mongering. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples. It's about love and support, not who you're attracted to.\n\nThe government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal in every state. It's not a political issue, it's a human rights issue. We need to be accepting of everyone, regardless of who they love.",
            "Okay, so, picture this: I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It makes you think, right? Just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's not good for you.  Like, should the public have access to it? Absolutely not. But for medicine?  Totally. Because, honestly, being illegal doesn't mean something's bad. It just means it's, well, illegal.  Think about it, there are a ton of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those kinds of things. They're serious drugs, but they're helpful.  So, why should we be afraid of marijuana just because of the stigma?  We should look at its benefits, you know?\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though.  Alcohol can get messed up too, but with marijuana, it's more about how you use it.  It's tricky, but maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just throw it open.  We need to get rid of the bad rap first, then people might use it responsibly.  People think marijuana is super bad because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or anything. It's not that scary. If we change how we see it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "You know, I think the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in a cute dress, matching shoes and purse. That was the routine. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends. But now, things are different. They have this teen mass, which is only thirty minutes long!  People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the sand!  Families run in late, it's a lot more relaxed. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis these days.  It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\n\n\nAs for all the stuff about priests and the accusations, I don't think allowing priests to get married or have female priests would have stopped those things from happening.  Married men can still be pedophiles, you know? It's about the person, not their marital status.  Plus, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where priests can be married, like that Reverend guy on that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and also be married, maybe they should look into a different religion.\n\n\n\nI think pedophilia is probably more about genetics. It's not like people choose to be that way. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening.  If they knew about it and covered it up, that's terrible, but I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\n\nHonestly, at first, I was okay with the idea, but everyone was still so shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq for the wrong reasons. There were lots of excuses used to justify it.  I think the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We now know that was all a lie, and it really bothers me.\n\nThe whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil. It feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it.\n\nEven Colin Powell, after that big speech he gave at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence even when he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong.  It feels like a serious abuse of power, something that should be punishable by law.  I think the Bush administration has totally disregarded the Constitution and tried to weaken it ever since 9/11. They probably came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was even that Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who said in his book (after he was probably pushed out) that the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  And I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil resources, which is just a sneaky way to do things.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for too long.  Pulling out right now would probably cause problems because Iraq could collapse into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nThe UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could create even more problems in the long run because it would raise questions about Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nRight now, the government seems to be falling apart. The Parliament isn't working well, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in control. Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, now has a lot of seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for power, and the political situation is really tense. \n\n(laughs)\n\nThere's a lot more I could say, but it's probably not appropriate for polite company.",
            "Mmm, this is a tough one.  The whole Iraq war thing... it just feels pointless, you know? I mean, it wasn't even a real declared war.  It feels like we just went in there to get back at Iraq after 9/11. I'm not really into keeping up with all the details, but it seems like we're trying to build democracy over there, kind of like making Iraq another America. And maybe we want their oil too.  But honestly, it's just making everyone upset. \n\nStaying there forever to build democracy is a long shot. Democracy doesn't just appear overnight. Plus, if we leave, they'll probably be mad because they'll have to start over.  It's a real mess.\n\nI honestly don't know much about this topic.  It's so complicated.\n\nMaybe the war should keep going, but not really as a \"war\". It feels like we're just showing off our military power, like saying \"Look how strong we are!\" But maybe we shouldn't have called it a war in the first place, because it wasn't officially declared by Congress.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam.\n\nAnd it's hard to think about the families who have loved ones in Iraq. You want them to come home safe, but it feels like we're hurting the Iraqi people too.  They're dealing with violence and lost education because of the conflict.\n\nBut trying to change their culture to be more like ours might make things worse. It could make them hate us even more.\n\nI just don't know what the answer is. This whole thing is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal, I just don't feel right about it. It should be up to the churches, you know?  The constitution even says separation of church and state, it's clear as day. Trying to force anything on this, trying to control it, that's going against what's already written.  \n\nThose pushing to make it illegal, I think they're just picking one church's belief over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal, it's what allows for religious freedom in this country. Even thinking about an amendment, that's wrong. It would go against what's already there and be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved at all.  I don't know why this guy is pushing for an amendment unless it's just because of his own Catholic beliefs. It seems like he's choosing one religion over others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There isn't a good reason to ban it, it's just personal opinion.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th terrorist attacks, even though there wasn't a strong link. They used the emotions from 9/11 to push people into supporting the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes.  This war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.  The US took down the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for the chaos and power vacuum that followed.\n\nThey tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and promote democracy.  But the US government should have known it would be a long and difficult fight, not a quick victory.  \n\nThere will always be resistance, no matter how many people want the US there.  You're fighting citizens, not an army, which makes it really hard.  \n\nI think the government should have planned better.  They weren't prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We're still there in 2006, with American troops dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi forces. It's a long process.\n\nI feel like the government tried to mislead the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission.  Building a new government takes time, as we saw in our own country.  \n\nIt's a tough decision because we've been there so long. How can we just leave now, after removing their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice for a democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, isn't it all about oil?  We're getting our oil from there.  The whole thing feels like it's about control and resources.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though they have WMDs.\n\nI just hope for peace in Iraq soon, but I'm not optimistic.",
            "Okay, so like, I'm totally for gay marriage, always have been. It's just a personal thing, you know? And it's becoming more and more clear that it's actually biological, not just something people choose. It feels wrong to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control.  It's just not fair. I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. This is about personal choices, families, real lives. Think about it - there are gay couples in my neighborhood who are as loving and normal as any other family, even if they can't legally get married. They walk their dogs, they hang out, just like everyone else. It's ridiculous that the government tries to dictate who can and can't get married.\n\nPlus, I've read a lot about how being gay might actually be something in your genes or brain chemistry. It's not a choice, like deciding to play a sport. It's just who you are. \n\nThe whole thing feels so unfair. Straight couples can get married secretly if they want, no big deal. But if two people who love each other want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone's obsessed with.",
            "Look, when you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. Everyone can see it!  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  \n\nWhatever you post online can change how people see you. If you're talking about causing trouble or violence, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet is a public space.\n\nIf your friend on Myspace gets a bulletin about something you posted, it's not just them who knows.

They might have been able to prevent it.\n\nBut, it's tough to know what's serious and what's just messing around. Like, maybe it was a school project gone wrong, or maybe it was something really serious. \n\nIn one case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked into it, they found some concerning things on the person's Facebook page. It was stuff that might have been a joke, but in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want it seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it. \n\nI don't think teachers should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, it's hard to say it's an invasion of privacy if the person themselves shared it publicly. They have a responsibility to take threats seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war has just dragged on for way too long. At first, I thought it was for a good reason, you know, to bring democracy to a country that didn't have it.  But now, I'm not so sure. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to prove something to the world. \n\nAnd honestly, I think some of the reasons we started it might have been a little shady, maybe linked to old issues between President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to give people in that country a fair political system, then that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we showed our strength in the beginning, those first few months of the war were pretty powerful. But it's been years now, and it just seems to keep going and going.\n\nLook, if our goal was to help people who were being oppressed by a dictator, that's a good thing. But I feel like that original purpose has gotten lost somewhere along the way. Now it feels like we're just stuck in this endless fight, and we need a clear end, a real victory or something.\n\nIt's just gone on too long.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country, right? We've been pouring billions and billions of dollars into this war, money that we could be using for our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. It's a drain on our resources when the reason for the war has become unclear.",
            "So, I have a question about privacy.  Like, what if someone sees something on Myspace that could be harmful and stops something bad from happening? Is that okay?\n\nI mean, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right?  So if you add someone as a friend, aren't you giving them permission to see your stuff?\n\nAnytime you put something online, you should know that lots of people might see it.  If someone found something on Myspace that could have saved a life, wouldn't that be a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time.  It would be unfair to single out certain students and look at their profiles just because they seem \"bad.\"\n\nIt depends on the situation, I guess.  Was someone looking for something specific, or were they just randomly browsing?\n\nPersonally, I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are people out there who can see things about me online. I saw a story on TV about a guy who found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute!\n\nIt makes me nervous because people can learn so much about you from your profiles. They can see your pictures, your interests, your class schedule, even who your friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share online, but it's hard because I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who's looking at what.\n\nI heard that some high schools have banned Myspace entirely. That seems a bit extreme to me.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Hmm, you know,  this Iraq situation is tough. It feels wrong to talk about it, like I'm just jumping on the bandwagon of people saying \"I told you so.\"  But honestly, it's hard to argue against the fact that the war was a bad idea from the start.  Everyone agrees except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong.  It's like looking at all these polls – in the US, in Iraq, even worldwide –  most people think it was a mistake.  Even US soldiers there feel it was a bad call and want us out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be another mess.  There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's like a clash of cultures,  and our government just doesn't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. Saddam was bad, that's for sure, but invading a country just turns things into a disaster. It's like quicksand. \n\nI don't know what to say about it. There's no good reason to stay there anymore.  I'm sure they have reasons they think are good, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but just get us out!  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone in a year, and some want us gone now.  They're the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't be blamed if things go bad.\n\nWe might not ever be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be better off leaving than staying in this mess.",
            "Hmm, yeah, I think gender inequality is still a thing in the U.S.  It's not just about women, though. It kinda depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nWomen still face a lot of challenges because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to be a thing, sometimes guys find it hard to work under a woman because of how society has always been.  Women often get all the qualifications for a higher position but don't get promoted because people think women shouldn't be in charge.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Like, imagine a dad staying home with the kids while his wife works - it's not common. People might judge him for it, thinking a man should be the breadwinner.  But maybe he wants to be with his kids, and it works for their family.\n\nAnd in fashion,  straight guys don't always get taken seriously. Maybe because people think fashion is \"for women\" and they don't know how a man could really understand it. It's like they're questioning his knowledge just because of his gender. \n\nSo yeah, I think gender discrimination is still around, but it's different for different people depending on their field.\n\nChanging this stuff is tough because society has set ways of thinking. We've come a long way, but change is slow. But things are getting better.  More women are becoming CEOs, and people are starting to accept it.  More dads are staying home with their kids, and people are getting used to it.  And people in fashion are starting to see that guys can have a good understanding of style too. \n\nMaybe the key is to show the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped.  If we just keep pushing for change, it will happen.\n\nIt's not just about gender either.\n\nThere are other kinds of discrimination too, like based on where you're from.  Someone who grew up on a farm might not have the best grammar, but they could be super smart.  If they become a CEO, some people might look down on them because of their accent or the way they speak.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list. You know, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket now. You get a citation, not arrested. I think if someone gets caught, it won't be as bad for things like job interviews.  Usually, a drug charge can really mess you up, but with marijuana, maybe not as much.  Even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about the future.  It's expensive to arrest and process people for drugs, and then court costs a lot too.  Lots of places don't want to spend that money, even if it means they could use that money for other things, like schools or helping the elderly. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, they probably think it's fine to decriminalize it. They can use that money for better things.  \n\nBut we shouldn't just have marijuana everywhere, you know?  It's still kind of a taboo thing.  If it was legal, it might be sold everywhere, and people could be smoking in public.  That would be weird. Plus, alcohol can be pretty bad for you, but marijuana can really mess with your life more, maybe even more than alcohol. It's hard to say because everyone reacts differently to drugs. Some people can handle it, others not so much.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yes to the idea of change in the Catholic Church. You know, a lot of what they do is pretty traditional, like things they've been doing for ages. And that's good, having roots in tradition. But, wouldn't it be nice to be a bit more open to change?  Some Catholics, they feel like they *have* to go to church every week, and there are all these strict rules about how things *should* be done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly.  They don't always welcome people who aren't exactly \"perfect\" Catholics, and they don't really accept other religions either.  \n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the Church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths, does it? We're always taught to love everyone, but it seems kinda hypocritical to say you love people but then not accept them.\n\nIt's like the rules say one thing, but how they actually act goes against it.  It's all so old-fashioned, but they just keep clinging on to it. \n\n  I don't think letting priests get married would solve everything, though.  I mean, I think it would be great if they could, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know, doing bad things. It's a different kind of problem.\n\nPeople who hurt children probably wouldn't stop just because they're married.  It's not about having a spouse, it's about something much deeper.  They would probably do it anyway.",
            "Hmm... this whole marriage thing is really tough, ya know? I'm still trying to figure out where I stand. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate, and figuring out how to define marriage without upsetting anyone. \n\nIt's a real head-scratcher.  Should the government even have a say in what marriage is, especially if it's seen as a religious sacrament?  I mean, we don't get special treatment from the government just because we're baptized, right? So maybe we should just see marriage as a civil union, a simple agreement between two people? \n\nIt's like, two people love each other, they want to be together, that's all that matters. The government shouldn't be getting involved in who they are or how they define their relationship. \n\nAnd this whole gay marriage debate...  It just seems so personal. I mean, if two people love each other, why not let them get married?\n\nIf each state can agree on something like this, maybe it should become a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage? That just feels wrong.  The constitution is for big, important things, not for deciding who can get married. It just doesn't seem like the right way to go about it.",
            "Um, growing up in a Christian home, my views on homosexuality are kinda complicated.  I have lots of gay friends and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I think they should have the right to marry. I don't think it's a big national issue, though.  Each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a rule for the whole country, you know?\n\nLike, some states are more liberal, and they'll probably support gay marriage, right?  If you live in a state that's okay with it, I don't think you should really try to argue against it. You chose to live there. \n\nBasically, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So, let each state decide if they want to legalize it.\n\nI already said it, but I just don't think it's fair for Bush to say the whole country can't have gay marriage. It should be up to the individual states. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide what they want to do.\n\nSome things should be left up to each state, plus he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so like, Myspace is open to everyone, right? It's like a public bulletin board where you share stuff for people to see. So, if you post something there, you gotta know people will see it, even school officials. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home.\n\nBut you know, if checking Myspace helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, that's a good thing, right? Schools have a responsibility to keep us safe. That's super important.\n\nBut, it's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. It's easier to express yourself in writing, but you gotta be careful what you put out there because everything stays online forever.  \n\nLike, if you post something bad about someone, even in an email, it could come back to bite you later.  \n\nIt's just, you know, Myspace is public, so if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get in trouble, that's kinda their own fault.\n\nI mean, school officials have a responsibility to keep us safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then I think it's okay.",
            "Okay, so... about this whole war thing... At first, I was totally for it.  Nine Eleven really got to me, you know? I felt like we needed to hit back hard, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were all so emotional about it that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a plan, and it backfired big time.\n\nNow I'm totally against it. I don't think it's doing anything. Honestly, as long as those people are fighting amongst themselves, they're not going to be causing trouble for us.  It feels like we're just getting in the way.  \n\nNine Eleven made me kind of numb to what's going on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. They fight each other constantly and can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there totally unprepared. We had no idea what we were facing, and their idea of war is so different from ours. They're just savage, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. And maybe that's what's best.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, caught up in the emotions of it all. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change their way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge.\n\nPresident Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because people wanted it, and I understand where he was coming from. But I think we could have handled it differently. We should have had a better plan, clearer goals, and more unity.\n\nIt feels like we were just acting on anger and emotion, and that's all we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're probably always going to be like that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there forever. We can't just stay there forever, and I think we're hurting ourselves by trying to."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "So, I think the Catholic Church needs to, like, update its views a bit. You know, people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not super accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions about these things, which is fine, but they seem a little stuck in the past to me. If they were more open to new ideas, maybe they wouldn't worry so much about losing people.\n\nI've heard some folks are starting to turn on the Church because of how they see these issues. People don't always agree with them anymore. For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that says it's completely wrong. \n\nSame goes for gay marriage or other things like that. If you support those things, you might not want to be in a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the recent scandals. It's hard to say for sure. \n\nI mean, even if priests were allowed to marry, would that have changed things? It's tough to know. But I think it's fair for priests to have both a job and a family life, just like everyone else.",
            "Okay, so, like, about gay marriage, I'm totally cool with it. I don't think it's something people choose, you know? It's just how they are.  Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay - it's just how life goes. It doesn't feel like a choice anyone makes, so it wouldn't be fair to judge them for it.  \n\nIt feels wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.  I haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems like it shouldn't be that way.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it's a security issue, or a big moral thing. It's just people wanting to be happy. It's not like the government should be telling people who they can and can't love.  It's their lives, you know?",
            "Okay, so I think gay marriage should totally be legal. I mean, seriously, what's the big deal? \n\nSome people freak out about gay couples messing up families, but it's just not the same thing. It's like comparing apples and oranges, you know? They're both fruit, but totally different.\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of rights that come with marriage, like taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's crazy! How can they not be considered family if they're spending their lives together?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples have just as much success in their relationships as straight couples. They have the same issues, the same joys, the same stuff. It's just love, right?\n\nHonestly, all the fuss about gay marriage being a religious issue doesn't make sense. They're not asking for a church wedding, just a legal document from the government.  It's like saying a civil union is okay, but a marriage isn't. That's just messed up.\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal.  They're the same relationship, just with different genders.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but that's just fear-mongering. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples. It's about love and support, not who you're attracted to.\n\nThe government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal in every state. It's not a political issue, it's a human rights issue. We need to be accepting of everyone, regardless of who they love.",
            "Okay, so, picture this: I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It makes you think, right? Just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's not good for you.  Like, should the public have access to it? Absolutely not. But for medicine?  Totally. Because, honestly, being illegal doesn't mean something's bad. It just means it's, well, illegal.  Think about it, there are a ton of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those kinds of things. They're serious drugs, but they're helpful.  So, why should we be afraid of marijuana just because of the stigma?  We should look at its benefits, you know?\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though.  Alcohol can get messed up too, but with marijuana, it's more about how you use it.  It's tricky, but maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just throw it open.  We need to get rid of the bad rap first, then people might use it responsibly.  People think marijuana is super bad because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or anything. It's not that scary. If we change how we see it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "You know, I think the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in a cute dress, matching shoes and purse. That was the routine. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends. But now, things are different. They have this teen mass, which is only thirty minutes long!  People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the sand!  Families run in late, it's a lot more relaxed. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis these days.  It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\n\n\nAs for all the stuff about priests and the accusations, I don't think allowing priests to get married or have female priests would have stopped those things from happening.  Married men can still be pedophiles, you know? It's about the person, not their marital status.  Plus, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where priests can be married, like that Reverend guy on that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and also be married, maybe they should look into a different religion.\n\n\n\nI think pedophilia is probably more about genetics. It's not like people choose to be that way. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening.  If they knew about it and covered it up, that's terrible, but I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\n\nHonestly, at first, I was okay with the idea, but everyone was still so shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq for the wrong reasons. There were lots of excuses used to justify it.  I think the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We now know that was all a lie, and it really bothers me.\n\nThe whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil. It feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it.\n\nEven Colin Powell, after that big speech he gave at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence even when he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong.  It feels like a serious abuse of power, something that should be punishable by law.  I think the Bush administration has totally disregarded the Constitution and tried to weaken it ever since 9/11. They probably came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was even that Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who said in his book (after he was probably pushed out) that the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  And I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil resources, which is just a sneaky way to do things.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for too long.  Pulling out right now would probably cause problems because Iraq could collapse into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nThe UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could create even more problems in the long run because it would raise questions about Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nRight now, the government seems to be falling apart. The Parliament isn't working well, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in control. Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, now has a lot of seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for power, and the political situation is really tense. \n\n(laughs)\n\nThere's a lot more I could say, but it's probably not appropriate for polite company.",
            "Mmm, this is a tough one.  The whole Iraq war thing... it just feels pointless, you know? I mean, it wasn't even a real declared war.  It feels like we just went in there to get back at Iraq after 9/11. I'm not really into keeping up with all the details, but it seems like we're trying to build democracy over there, kind of like making Iraq another America. And maybe we want their oil too.  But honestly, it's just making everyone upset. \n\nStaying there forever to build democracy is a long shot. Democracy doesn't just appear overnight. Plus, if we leave, they'll probably be mad because they'll have to start over.  It's a real mess.\n\nI honestly don't know much about this topic.  It's so complicated.\n\nMaybe the war should keep going, but not really as a \"war\". It feels like we're just showing off our military power, like saying \"Look how strong we are!\" But maybe we shouldn't have called it a war in the first place, because it wasn't officially declared by Congress.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam.\n\nAnd it's hard to think about the families who have loved ones in Iraq. You want them to come home safe, but it feels like we're hurting the Iraqi people too.  They're dealing with violence and lost education because of the conflict.\n\nBut trying to change their culture to be more like ours might make things worse. It could make them hate us even more.\n\nI just don't know what the answer is. This whole thing is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal, I just don't feel right about it. It should be up to the churches, you know?  The constitution even says separation of church and state, it's clear as day. Trying to force anything on this, trying to control it, that's going against what's already written.  \n\nThose pushing to make it illegal, I think they're just picking one church's belief over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal, it's what allows for religious freedom in this country. Even thinking about an amendment, that's wrong. It would go against what's already there and be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved at all.  I don't know why this guy is pushing for an amendment unless it's just because of his own Catholic beliefs. It seems like he's choosing one religion over others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There isn't a good reason to ban it, it's just personal opinion.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th terrorist attacks, even though there wasn't a strong link. They used the emotions from 9/11 to push people into supporting the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes.  This war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.  The US took down the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for the chaos and power vacuum that followed.\n\nThey tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and promote democracy.  But the US government should have known it would be a long and difficult fight, not a quick victory.  \n\nThere will always be resistance, no matter how many people want the US there.  You're fighting citizens, not an army, which makes it really hard.  \n\nI think the government should have planned better.  They weren't prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We're still there in 2006, with American troops dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi forces. It's a long process.\n\nI feel like the government tried to mislead the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission.  Building a new government takes time, as we saw in our own country.  \n\nIt's a tough decision because we've been there so long. How can we just leave now, after removing their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice for a democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, isn't it all about oil?  We're getting our oil from there.  The whole thing feels like it's about control and resources.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though they have WMDs.\n\nI just hope for peace in Iraq soon, but I'm not optimistic.",
            "Okay, so like, I'm totally for gay marriage, always have been. It's just a personal thing, you know? And it's becoming more and more clear that it's actually biological, not just something people choose. It feels wrong to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control.  It's just not fair. I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. This is about personal choices, families, real lives. Think about it - there are gay couples in my neighborhood who are as loving and normal as any other family, even if they can't legally get married. They walk their dogs, they hang out, just like everyone else. It's ridiculous that the government tries to dictate who can and can't get married.\n\nPlus, I've read a lot about how being gay might actually be something in your genes or brain chemistry. It's not a choice, like deciding to play a sport. It's just who you are. \n\nThe whole thing feels so unfair. Straight couples can get married secretly if they want, no big deal. But if two people who love each other want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone's obsessed with.",
            "Look, when you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. Everyone can see it!  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  \n\nWhatever you post online can change how people see you. If you're talking about causing trouble or violence, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet is a public space.\n\nIf your friend on Myspace gets a bulletin about something you posted, it's not just them who knows.

They might have been able to prevent it.\n\nBut, it's tough to know what's serious and what's just messing around. Like, maybe it was a school project gone wrong, or maybe it was something really serious. \n\nIn one case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked into it, they found some concerning things on the person's Facebook page. It was stuff that might have been a joke, but in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want it seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it. \n\nI don't think teachers should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, it's hard to say it's an invasion of privacy if the person themselves shared it publicly. They have a responsibility to take threats seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war has just dragged on for way too long. At first, I thought it was for a good reason, you know, to bring democracy to a country that didn't have it.  But now, I'm not so sure. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to prove something to the world. \n\nAnd honestly, I think some of the reasons we started it might have been a little shady, maybe linked to old issues between President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to give people in that country a fair political system, then that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we showed our strength in the beginning, those first few months of the war were pretty powerful. But it's been years now, and it just seems to keep going and going.\n\nLook, if our goal was to help people who were being oppressed by a dictator, that's a good thing. But I feel like that original purpose has gotten lost somewhere along the way. Now it feels like we're just stuck in this endless fight, and we need a clear end, a real victory or something.\n\nIt's just gone on too long.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country, right? We've been pouring billions and billions of dollars into this war, money that we could be using for our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. It's a drain on our resources when the reason for the war has become unclear.",
            "So, I have a question about privacy.  Like, what if someone sees something on Myspace that could be harmful and stops something bad from happening? Is that okay?\n\nI mean, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right?  So if you add someone as a friend, aren't you giving them permission to see your stuff?\n\nAnytime you put something online, you should know that lots of people might see it.  If someone found something on Myspace that could have saved a life, wouldn't that be a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time.  It would be unfair to single out certain students and look at their profiles just because they seem \"bad.\"\n\nIt depends on the situation, I guess.  Was someone looking for something specific, or were they just randomly browsing?\n\nPersonally, I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are people out there who can see things about me online. I saw a story on TV about a guy who found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute!\n\nIt makes me nervous because people can learn so much about you from your profiles. They can see your pictures, your interests, your class schedule, even who your friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share online, but it's hard because I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who's looking at what.\n\nI heard that some high schools have banned Myspace entirely. That seems a bit extreme to me.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Hmm, you know,  this Iraq situation is tough. It feels wrong to talk about it, like I'm just jumping on the bandwagon of people saying \"I told you so.\"  But honestly, it's hard to argue against the fact that the war was a bad idea from the start.  Everyone agrees except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong.  It's like looking at all these polls – in the US, in Iraq, even worldwide –  most people think it was a mistake.  Even US soldiers there feel it was a bad call and want us out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be another mess.  There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's like a clash of cultures,  and our government just doesn't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. Saddam was bad, that's for sure, but invading a country just turns things into a disaster. It's like quicksand. \n\nI don't know what to say about it. There's no good reason to stay there anymore.  I'm sure they have reasons they think are good, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but just get us out!  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone in a year, and some want us gone now.  They're the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't be blamed if things go bad.\n\nWe might not ever be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be better off leaving than staying in this mess.",
            "Hmm, yeah, I think gender inequality is still a thing in the U.S.  It's not just about women, though. It kinda depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nWomen still face a lot of challenges because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to be a thing, sometimes guys find it hard to work under a woman because of how society has always been.  Women often get all the qualifications for a higher position but don't get promoted because people think women shouldn't be in charge.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Like, imagine a dad staying home with the kids while his wife works - it's not common. People might judge him for it, thinking a man should be the breadwinner.  But maybe he wants to be with his kids, and it works for their family.\n\nAnd in fashion,  straight guys don't always get taken seriously. Maybe because people think fashion is \"for women\" and they don't know how a man could really understand it. It's like they're questioning his knowledge just because of his gender. \n\nSo yeah, I think gender discrimination is still around, but it's different for different people depending on their field.\n\nChanging this stuff is tough because society has set ways of thinking. We've come a long way, but change is slow. But things are getting better.  More women are becoming CEOs, and people are starting to accept it.  More dads are staying home with their kids, and people are getting used to it.  And people in fashion are starting to see that guys can have a good understanding of style too. \n\nMaybe the key is to show the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped.  If we just keep pushing for change, it will happen.\n\nIt's not just about gender either.\n\nThere are other kinds of discrimination too, like based on where you're from.  Someone who grew up on a farm might not have the best grammar, but they could be super smart.  If they become a CEO, some people might look down on them because of their accent or the way they speak.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list. You know, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket now. You get a citation, not arrested. I think if someone gets caught, it won't be as bad for things like job interviews.  Usually, a drug charge can really mess you up, but with marijuana, maybe not as much.  Even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about the future.  It's expensive to arrest and process people for drugs, and then court costs a lot too.  Lots of places don't want to spend that money, even if it means they could use that money for other things, like schools or helping the elderly. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, they probably think it's fine to decriminalize it. They can use that money for better things.  \n\nBut we shouldn't just have marijuana everywhere, you know?  It's still kind of a taboo thing.  If it was legal, it might be sold everywhere, and people could be smoking in public.  That would be weird. Plus, alcohol can be pretty bad for you, but marijuana can really mess with your life more, maybe even more than alcohol. It's hard to say because everyone reacts differently to drugs. Some people can handle it, others not so much.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yes to the idea of change in the Catholic Church. You know, a lot of what they do is pretty traditional, like things they've been doing for ages. And that's good, having roots in tradition. But, wouldn't it be nice to be a bit more open to change?  Some Catholics, they feel like they *have* to go to church every week, and there are all these strict rules about how things *should* be done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly.  They don't always welcome people who aren't exactly \"perfect\" Catholics, and they don't really accept other religions either.  \n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the Church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths, does it? We're always taught to love everyone, but it seems kinda hypocritical to say you love people but then not accept them.\n\nIt's like the rules say one thing, but how they actually act goes against it.  It's all so old-fashioned, but they just keep clinging on to it. \n\n  I don't think letting priests get married would solve everything, though.  I mean, I think it would be great if they could, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know, doing bad things. It's a different kind of problem.\n\nPeople who hurt children probably wouldn't stop just because they're married.  It's not about having a spouse, it's about something much deeper.  They would probably do it anyway.",
            "Hmm... this whole marriage thing is really tough, ya know? I'm still trying to figure out where I stand. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate, and figuring out how to define marriage without upsetting anyone. \n\nIt's a real head-scratcher.  Should the government even have a say in what marriage is, especially if it's seen as a religious sacrament?  I mean, we don't get special treatment from the government just because we're baptized, right? So maybe we should just see marriage as a civil union, a simple agreement between two people? \n\nIt's like, two people love each other, they want to be together, that's all that matters. The government shouldn't be getting involved in who they are or how they define their relationship. \n\nAnd this whole gay marriage debate...  It just seems so personal. I mean, if two people love each other, why not let them get married?\n\nIf each state can agree on something like this, maybe it should become a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage? That just feels wrong.  The constitution is for big, important things, not for deciding who can get married. It just doesn't seem like the right way to go about it.",
            "Um, growing up in a Christian home, my views on homosexuality are kinda complicated.  I have lots of gay friends and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I think they should have the right to marry. I don't think it's a big national issue, though.  Each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a rule for the whole country, you know?\n\nLike, some states are more liberal, and they'll probably support gay marriage, right?  If you live in a state that's okay with it, I don't think you should really try to argue against it. You chose to live there. \n\nBasically, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So, let each state decide if they want to legalize it.\n\nI already said it, but I just don't think it's fair for Bush to say the whole country can't have gay marriage. It should be up to the individual states. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide what they want to do.\n\nSome things should be left up to each state, plus he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so like, Myspace is open to everyone, right? It's like a public bulletin board where you share stuff for people to see. So, if you post something there, you gotta know people will see it, even school officials. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home.\n\nBut you know, if checking Myspace helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, that's a good thing, right? Schools have a responsibility to keep us safe. That's super important.\n\nBut, it's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. It's easier to express yourself in writing, but you gotta be careful what you put out there because everything stays online forever.  \n\nLike, if you post something bad about someone, even in an email, it could come back to bite you later.  \n\nIt's just, you know, Myspace is public, so if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get in trouble, that's kinda their own fault.\n\nI mean, school officials have a responsibility to keep us safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then I think it's okay.",
            "Okay, so... about this whole war thing... At first, I was totally for it.  Nine Eleven really got to me, you know? I felt like we needed to hit back hard, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were all so emotional about it that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a plan, and it backfired big time.\n\nNow I'm totally against it. I don't think it's doing anything. Honestly, as long as those people are fighting amongst themselves, they're not going to be causing trouble for us.  It feels like we're just getting in the way.  \n\nNine Eleven made me kind of numb to what's going on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. They fight each other constantly and can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there totally unprepared. We had no idea what we were facing, and their idea of war is so different from ours. They're just savage, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. And maybe that's what's best.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, caught up in the emotions of it all. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change their way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge.\n\nPresident Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because people wanted it, and I understand where he was coming from. But I think we could have handled it differently. We should have had a better plan, clearer goals, and more unity.\n\nIt feels like we were just acting on anger and emotion, and that's all we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're probably always going to be like that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there forever. We can't just stay there forever, and I think we're hurting ourselves by trying to."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "So, I think the Catholic Church needs to, like, update its views a bit. You know, people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not super accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions about these things, which is fine, but they seem a little stuck in the past to me. If they were more open to new ideas, maybe they wouldn't worry so much about losing people.\n\nI've heard some folks are starting to turn on the Church because of how they see these issues. People don't always agree with them anymore. For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that says it's completely wrong. \n\nSame goes for gay marriage or other things like that. If you support those things, you might not want to be in a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the recent scandals. It's hard to say for sure. \n\nI mean, even if priests were allowed to marry, would that have changed things? It's tough to know. But I think it's fair for priests to have both a job and a family life, just like everyone else.",
            "Okay, so, like, about gay marriage, I'm totally cool with it. I don't think it's something people choose, you know? It's just how they are.  Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay - it's just how life goes. It doesn't feel like a choice anyone makes, so it wouldn't be fair to judge them for it.  \n\nIt feels wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.  I haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems like it shouldn't be that way.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it's a security issue, or a big moral thing. It's just people wanting to be happy. It's not like the government should be telling people who they can and can't love.  It's their lives, you know?",
            "Okay, so I think gay marriage should totally be legal. I mean, seriously, what's the big deal? \n\nSome people freak out about gay couples messing up families, but it's just not the same thing. It's like comparing apples and oranges, you know? They're both fruit, but totally different.\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of rights that come with marriage, like taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's crazy! How can they not be considered family if they're spending their lives together?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples have just as much success in their relationships as straight couples. They have the same issues, the same joys, the same stuff. It's just love, right?\n\nHonestly, all the fuss about gay marriage being a religious issue doesn't make sense. They're not asking for a church wedding, just a legal document from the government.  It's like saying a civil union is okay, but a marriage isn't. That's just messed up.\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal.  They're the same relationship, just with different genders.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but that's just fear-mongering. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples. It's about love and support, not who you're attracted to.\n\nThe government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal in every state. It's not a political issue, it's a human rights issue. We need to be accepting of everyone, regardless of who they love.",
            "Okay, so, picture this: I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It makes you think, right? Just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's not good for you.  Like, should the public have access to it? Absolutely not. But for medicine?  Totally. Because, honestly, being illegal doesn't mean something's bad. It just means it's, well, illegal.  Think about it, there are a ton of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those kinds of things. They're serious drugs, but they're helpful.  So, why should we be afraid of marijuana just because of the stigma?  We should look at its benefits, you know?\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though.  Alcohol can get messed up too, but with marijuana, it's more about how you use it.  It's tricky, but maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just throw it open.  We need to get rid of the bad rap first, then people might use it responsibly.  People think marijuana is super bad because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or anything. It's not that scary. If we change how we see it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "You know, I think the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in a cute dress, matching shoes and purse. That was the routine. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends. But now, things are different. They have this teen mass, which is only thirty minutes long!  People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the sand!  Families run in late, it's a lot more relaxed. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis these days.  It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\n\n\nAs for all the stuff about priests and the accusations, I don't think allowing priests to get married or have female priests would have stopped those things from happening.  Married men can still be pedophiles, you know? It's about the person, not their marital status.  Plus, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where priests can be married, like that Reverend guy on that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and also be married, maybe they should look into a different religion.\n\n\n\nI think pedophilia is probably more about genetics. It's not like people choose to be that way. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening.  If they knew about it and covered it up, that's terrible, but I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\n\nHonestly, at first, I was okay with the idea, but everyone was still so shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq for the wrong reasons. There were lots of excuses used to justify it.  I think the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We now know that was all a lie, and it really bothers me.\n\nThe whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil. It feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it.\n\nEven Colin Powell, after that big speech he gave at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence even when he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong.  It feels like a serious abuse of power, something that should be punishable by law.  I think the Bush administration has totally disregarded the Constitution and tried to weaken it ever since 9/11. They probably came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was even that Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who said in his book (after he was probably pushed out) that the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  And I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil resources, which is just a sneaky way to do things.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for too long.  Pulling out right now would probably cause problems because Iraq could collapse into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nThe UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could create even more problems in the long run because it would raise questions about Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nRight now, the government seems to be falling apart. The Parliament isn't working well, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in control. Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, now has a lot of seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for power, and the political situation is really tense. \n\n(laughs)\n\nThere's a lot more I could say, but it's probably not appropriate for polite company.",
            "Mmm, this is a tough one.  The whole Iraq war thing... it just feels pointless, you know? I mean, it wasn't even a real declared war.  It feels like we just went in there to get back at Iraq after 9/11. I'm not really into keeping up with all the details, but it seems like we're trying to build democracy over there, kind of like making Iraq another America. And maybe we want their oil too.  But honestly, it's just making everyone upset. \n\nStaying there forever to build democracy is a long shot. Democracy doesn't just appear overnight. Plus, if we leave, they'll probably be mad because they'll have to start over.  It's a real mess.\n\nI honestly don't know much about this topic.  It's so complicated.\n\nMaybe the war should keep going, but not really as a \"war\". It feels like we're just showing off our military power, like saying \"Look how strong we are!\" But maybe we shouldn't have called it a war in the first place, because it wasn't officially declared by Congress.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam.\n\nAnd it's hard to think about the families who have loved ones in Iraq. You want them to come home safe, but it feels like we're hurting the Iraqi people too.  They're dealing with violence and lost education because of the conflict.\n\nBut trying to change their culture to be more like ours might make things worse. It could make them hate us even more.\n\nI just don't know what the answer is. This whole thing is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal, I just don't feel right about it. It should be up to the churches, you know?  The constitution even says separation of church and state, it's clear as day. Trying to force anything on this, trying to control it, that's going against what's already written.  \n\nThose pushing to make it illegal, I think they're just picking one church's belief over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal, it's what allows for religious freedom in this country. Even thinking about an amendment, that's wrong. It would go against what's already there and be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved at all.  I don't know why this guy is pushing for an amendment unless it's just because of his own Catholic beliefs. It seems like he's choosing one religion over others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There isn't a good reason to ban it, it's just personal opinion.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th terrorist attacks, even though there wasn't a strong link. They used the emotions from 9/11 to push people into supporting the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes.  This war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.  The US took down the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for the chaos and power vacuum that followed.\n\nThey tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and promote democracy.  But the US government should have known it would be a long and difficult fight, not a quick victory.  \n\nThere will always be resistance, no matter how many people want the US there.  You're fighting citizens, not an army, which makes it really hard.  \n\nI think the government should have planned better.  They weren't prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We're still there in 2006, with American troops dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi forces. It's a long process.\n\nI feel like the government tried to mislead the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission.  Building a new government takes time, as we saw in our own country.  \n\nIt's a tough decision because we've been there so long. How can we just leave now, after removing their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice for a democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, isn't it all about oil?  We're getting our oil from there.  The whole thing feels like it's about control and resources.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though they have WMDs.\n\nI just hope for peace in Iraq soon, but I'm not optimistic.",
            "Okay, so like, I'm totally for gay marriage, always have been. It's just a personal thing, you know? And it's becoming more and more clear that it's actually biological, not just something people choose. It feels wrong to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control.  It's just not fair. I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. This is about personal choices, families, real lives. Think about it - there are gay couples in my neighborhood who are as loving and normal as any other family, even if they can't legally get married. They walk their dogs, they hang out, just like everyone else. It's ridiculous that the government tries to dictate who can and can't get married.\n\nPlus, I've read a lot about how being gay might actually be something in your genes or brain chemistry. It's not a choice, like deciding to play a sport. It's just who you are. \n\nThe whole thing feels so unfair. Straight couples can get married secretly if they want, no big deal. But if two people who love each other want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone's obsessed with.",
            "Look, when you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. Everyone can see it!  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  \n\nWhatever you post online can change how people see you. If you're talking about causing trouble or violence, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet is a public space.\n\nIf your friend on Myspace gets a bulletin about something you posted, it's not just them who knows.

They might have been able to prevent it.\n\nBut, it's tough to know what's serious and what's just messing around. Like, maybe it was a school project gone wrong, or maybe it was something really serious. \n\nIn one case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked into it, they found some concerning things on the person's Facebook page. It was stuff that might have been a joke, but in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want it seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it. \n\nI don't think teachers should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, it's hard to say it's an invasion of privacy if the person themselves shared it publicly. They have a responsibility to take threats seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war has just dragged on for way too long. At first, I thought it was for a good reason, you know, to bring democracy to a country that didn't have it.  But now, I'm not so sure. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to prove something to the world. \n\nAnd honestly, I think some of the reasons we started it might have been a little shady, maybe linked to old issues between President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to give people in that country a fair political system, then that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we showed our strength in the beginning, those first few months of the war were pretty powerful. But it's been years now, and it just seems to keep going and going.\n\nLook, if our goal was to help people who were being oppressed by a dictator, that's a good thing. But I feel like that original purpose has gotten lost somewhere along the way. Now it feels like we're just stuck in this endless fight, and we need a clear end, a real victory or something.\n\nIt's just gone on too long.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country, right? We've been pouring billions and billions of dollars into this war, money that we could be using for our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. It's a drain on our resources when the reason for the war has become unclear.",
            "So, I have a question about privacy.  Like, what if someone sees something on Myspace that could be harmful and stops something bad from happening? Is that okay?\n\nI mean, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right?  So if you add someone as a friend, aren't you giving them permission to see your stuff?\n\nAnytime you put something online, you should know that lots of people might see it.  If someone found something on Myspace that could have saved a life, wouldn't that be a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time.  It would be unfair to single out certain students and look at their profiles just because they seem \"bad.\"\n\nIt depends on the situation, I guess.  Was someone looking for something specific, or were they just randomly browsing?\n\nPersonally, I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are people out there who can see things about me online. I saw a story on TV about a guy who found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute!\n\nIt makes me nervous because people can learn so much about you from your profiles. They can see your pictures, your interests, your class schedule, even who your friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share online, but it's hard because I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who's looking at what.\n\nI heard that some high schools have banned Myspace entirely. That seems a bit extreme to me.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Hmm, you know,  this Iraq situation is tough. It feels wrong to talk about it, like I'm just jumping on the bandwagon of people saying \"I told you so.\"  But honestly, it's hard to argue against the fact that the war was a bad idea from the start.  Everyone agrees except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong.  It's like looking at all these polls – in the US, in Iraq, even worldwide –  most people think it was a mistake.  Even US soldiers there feel it was a bad call and want us out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be another mess.  There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's like a clash of cultures,  and our government just doesn't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. Saddam was bad, that's for sure, but invading a country just turns things into a disaster. It's like quicksand. \n\nI don't know what to say about it. There's no good reason to stay there anymore.  I'm sure they have reasons they think are good, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but just get us out!  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone in a year, and some want us gone now.  They're the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't be blamed if things go bad.\n\nWe might not ever be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be better off leaving than staying in this mess.",
            "Hmm, yeah, I think gender inequality is still a thing in the U.S.  It's not just about women, though. It kinda depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nWomen still face a lot of challenges because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to be a thing, sometimes guys find it hard to work under a woman because of how society has always been.  Women often get all the qualifications for a higher position but don't get promoted because people think women shouldn't be in charge.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Like, imagine a dad staying home with the kids while his wife works - it's not common. People might judge him for it, thinking a man should be the breadwinner.  But maybe he wants to be with his kids, and it works for their family.\n\nAnd in fashion,  straight guys don't always get taken seriously. Maybe because people think fashion is \"for women\" and they don't know how a man could really understand it. It's like they're questioning his knowledge just because of his gender. \n\nSo yeah, I think gender discrimination is still around, but it's different for different people depending on their field.\n\nChanging this stuff is tough because society has set ways of thinking. We've come a long way, but change is slow. But things are getting better.  More women are becoming CEOs, and people are starting to accept it.  More dads are staying home with their kids, and people are getting used to it.  And people in fashion are starting to see that guys can have a good understanding of style too. \n\nMaybe the key is to show the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped.  If we just keep pushing for change, it will happen.\n\nIt's not just about gender either.\n\nThere are other kinds of discrimination too, like based on where you're from.  Someone who grew up on a farm might not have the best grammar, but they could be super smart.  If they become a CEO, some people might look down on them because of their accent or the way they speak.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list. You know, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket now. You get a citation, not arrested. I think if someone gets caught, it won't be as bad for things like job interviews.  Usually, a drug charge can really mess you up, but with marijuana, maybe not as much.  Even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about the future.  It's expensive to arrest and process people for drugs, and then court costs a lot too.  Lots of places don't want to spend that money, even if it means they could use that money for other things, like schools or helping the elderly. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, they probably think it's fine to decriminalize it. They can use that money for better things.  \n\nBut we shouldn't just have marijuana everywhere, you know?  It's still kind of a taboo thing.  If it was legal, it might be sold everywhere, and people could be smoking in public.  That would be weird. Plus, alcohol can be pretty bad for you, but marijuana can really mess with your life more, maybe even more than alcohol. It's hard to say because everyone reacts differently to drugs. Some people can handle it, others not so much.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yes to the idea of change in the Catholic Church. You know, a lot of what they do is pretty traditional, like things they've been doing for ages. And that's good, having roots in tradition. But, wouldn't it be nice to be a bit more open to change?  Some Catholics, they feel like they *have* to go to church every week, and there are all these strict rules about how things *should* be done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly.  They don't always welcome people who aren't exactly \"perfect\" Catholics, and they don't really accept other religions either.  \n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the Church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths, does it? We're always taught to love everyone, but it seems kinda hypocritical to say you love people but then not accept them.\n\nIt's like the rules say one thing, but how they actually act goes against it.  It's all so old-fashioned, but they just keep clinging on to it. \n\n  I don't think letting priests get married would solve everything, though.  I mean, I think it would be great if they could, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know, doing bad things. It's a different kind of problem.\n\nPeople who hurt children probably wouldn't stop just because they're married.  It's not about having a spouse, it's about something much deeper.  They would probably do it anyway.",
            "Hmm... this whole marriage thing is really tough, ya know? I'm still trying to figure out where I stand. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate, and figuring out how to define marriage without upsetting anyone. \n\nIt's a real head-scratcher.  Should the government even have a say in what marriage is, especially if it's seen as a religious sacrament?  I mean, we don't get special treatment from the government just because we're baptized, right? So maybe we should just see marriage as a civil union, a simple agreement between two people? \n\nIt's like, two people love each other, they want to be together, that's all that matters. The government shouldn't be getting involved in who they are or how they define their relationship. \n\nAnd this whole gay marriage debate...  It just seems so personal. I mean, if two people love each other, why not let them get married?\n\nIf each state can agree on something like this, maybe it should become a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage? That just feels wrong.  The constitution is for big, important things, not for deciding who can get married. It just doesn't seem like the right way to go about it.",
            "Um, growing up in a Christian home, my views on homosexuality are kinda complicated.  I have lots of gay friends and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I think they should have the right to marry. I don't think it's a big national issue, though.  Each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a rule for the whole country, you know?\n\nLike, some states are more liberal, and they'll probably support gay marriage, right?  If you live in a state that's okay with it, I don't think you should really try to argue against it. You chose to live there. \n\nBasically, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So, let each state decide if they want to legalize it.\n\nI already said it, but I just don't think it's fair for Bush to say the whole country can't have gay marriage. It should be up to the individual states. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide what they want to do.\n\nSome things should be left up to each state, plus he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so like, Myspace is open to everyone, right? It's like a public bulletin board where you share stuff for people to see. So, if you post something there, you gotta know people will see it, even school officials. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home.\n\nBut you know, if checking Myspace helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, that's a good thing, right? Schools have a responsibility to keep us safe. That's super important.\n\nBut, it's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. It's easier to express yourself in writing, but you gotta be careful what you put out there because everything stays online forever.  \n\nLike, if you post something bad about someone, even in an email, it could come back to bite you later.  \n\nIt's just, you know, Myspace is public, so if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get in trouble, that's kinda their own fault.\n\nI mean, school officials have a responsibility to keep us safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then I think it's okay.",
            "Okay, so... about this whole war thing... At first, I was totally for it.  Nine Eleven really got to me, you know? I felt like we needed to hit back hard, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were all so emotional about it that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a plan, and it backfired big time.\n\nNow I'm totally against it. I don't think it's doing anything. Honestly, as long as those people are fighting amongst themselves, they're not going to be causing trouble for us.  It feels like we're just getting in the way.  \n\nNine Eleven made me kind of numb to what's going on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. They fight each other constantly and can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there totally unprepared. We had no idea what we were facing, and their idea of war is so different from ours. They're just savage, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. And maybe that's what's best.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, caught up in the emotions of it all. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change their way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge.\n\nPresident Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because people wanted it, and I understand where he was coming from. But I think we could have handled it differently. We should have had a better plan, clearer goals, and more unity.\n\nIt feels like we were just acting on anger and emotion, and that's all we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're probably always going to be like that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there forever. We can't just stay there forever, and I think we're hurting ourselves by trying to."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs to update its thinking in a few ways. \n\nFolks are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's partly because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. See, the Church has strong opinions on these matters, which is fine, but some of those views feel a bit outdated. \n\nI think if they were a bit more open-minded, they wouldn't have to worry about people leaving. \n\nI've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. They feel the Church has the wrong perspective. \n\nTake abortion, for example. If you believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable in a place that condemns it. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to belong to a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to marry.  But I'm not sure if that would have stopped recent scandals. \n\nIt's tough to say if being married or having women priests would have changed things. It's just hard to know.\n\nI mean, the Church says priests are \"married to God,\" but everyone else has a job and a family life. Why can't priests have both?",
            "Hmm...this whole gay marriage thing, you know? I'm not against it at all.  I just don't think it's a choice people make, like deciding to be this way or that.  It's just how they are, right?  So why should we judge them for it?  It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nTo be honest, I haven't really thought about it too much. But it just feels wrong to me, like saying someone's love is less valid because of who they love.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should be involved. It's not like a legal issue or a moral one, at least not in my opinion. It's just about people loving each other.  Why should we put them on display like they did something wrong?  We shouldn't be punishing people for who they are.\n\nIt just seems like the government has no business interfering in people's lives like this. It's about love, and love shouldn't be controlled.",
            "Okay, so like, I think gay marriage should totally be legal. Why not, right?  Some folks think gay couples are bad news for straight families, but that's just not true. They're different, you know? Like, two sides of the same coin - same thing, different flips.  It's all about rights, too.  Stuff like taxes and health care. Like, if you're sick, your partner can't be there for you if you're not officially family.  Isn't that crazy? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?  And studies show that gay couples are just as happy as straight couples.  It's the same deal! The thing is, people get hung up on this idea that gay marriage is about churches, but it's really just about a legal document.  Like, why can't the government recognize their relationship? It's like separate but unequal - it doesn't make sense.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and stuff, but honestly, gay parents are just like straight parents. They love their kids, they care for them.  It's about the individuals, not their sexual orientation.  I've heard stories about kids of gay parents getting bullied, which is awful.  But that's society's problem, not the parents.\n\nThe government should totally get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about basic rights and equality.  It's frustrating that some people base their opinions on religion and morality, but everyone's beliefs are different.  It's not fair to impose one group's views on everyone else. And honestly, some people think gay people are broken or damaged, which is just wrong. Science has proven that's not true.",
            "Okay, so like, I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. And you know, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be good for you, right?  I mean, I don't think it should be legal for everyone to just buy it, no way. But for medicine, I think it should be okay.  It's not like just because it's illegal, it's automatically bad.  There are lots of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet – those are all controlled, but we use them all the time because they help people.  It's kinda messed up to say it's not okay just because people have a bad image of marijuana.  We gotta look at the good stuff it can do.\n\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though, because you can really get addicted to it if you're not careful. But you can with alcohol too, so it's tricky.  Maybe we should make it legal gradually, not all at once, you know?  That way people can get used to it and learn to use it responsibly.  \n\nPeople think marijuana is so bad just because it's illegal. But it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine, for sure. If we change how people think about it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "Hmm... you know, I think churches have changed a lot since, like, the early 2000s. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was little, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore these cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, you know, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, and all my friends were there on the weekends. We'd just hang out. But now, they have this thing called Teen Mass – it's only thirty minutes long! And people dress so casually, especially in the summer. They come straight from the beach, in their swimsuits! Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up fancy, now people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.  \n\nOh, and I don't really know about all the church politics, but yeah, that's basically it. \n\nAs for those accusations against priests, I don't think letting women be priests or letting priests get married would have stopped that.  Some married men become pedophiles too, right? It's not about whether they're married or not. It's about the person.\n\nI mean, there are religions where priests can get married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  They have ministers who are married.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could look into a different religion.\n\nI think it's mostly genetic, you know? People are born that way. Maybe their upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly in their genes. You can't really change that even with marriage.",
            "Ugh,  you know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still super shaken up from 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses.  The Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was involved with Osama Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out to be a big lie. It really makes me mad! \n\nI just think the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN about it, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong, you know? It feels like they don't even care about the Constitution anymore. \n\nI think they went into office wanting to go to war.  There was even this guy, the Treasury Secretary, who wrote a book after he got kicked out of office, saying basically that. It seems like George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad. Plus, I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. \n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out right now could cause chaos and more people getting hurt. It seems they're trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize things, but I don't know if that's a good idea either. It could mess up Iraq's sovereignty even more.\n\nThe government there is falling apart. The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has a lot of seats in Parliament. It's all so complicated and messy.",
            "So, like, I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless, you know? It wasn't even a real war, like, they never officially declared it. It just feels like we went in there to get back at them for 9/11, like we were just punishing them. \n\nI don't follow the war too closely, so I don't know all the details. But it seems like we're just staying there to try and build democracy, which is a good thing, I guess, but it's taking forever. And then there's the oil, which is like, a major factor. \n\nBut honestly, it's just making everyone unhappy. If we stay, we're stuck trying to force democracy on them, which isn't going to happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad because we messed everything up and left them to deal with it on their own. It's a total mess.\n\nThis is a tough one, because I don't really know what to think. I feel bad for the soldiers and their families, and I want them to be safe. But I also worry about how this is making everyone feel. It's like we're creating more problems than we're solving.\n\nI think it's important to help, but it feels like we're just prolonging the conflict. And honestly, it's making Bush look bad. This could end up being another Vietnam, where we're seen as the bad guys.",
            "Okay, so I just don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or illegal.  I mean, our constitution clearly states separation of church and state, right? To try and make laws about this would be going against what's already written.  \n\nIt seems to me like people pushing to make it illegal are just picking one church's beliefs over others. Like, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some spots like Boston.  But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is super important for religious freedom in the US.  Even trying to make an amendment about this would be wrong, because it would go against the constitution and it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The guy pushing for this amendment is just trying to force his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any politician. There's no good reason to ban it, it won't help the economy or anything, and it might even be good for society.",
            "Ok, so about the war in Iraq... I don't think our government was totally straight with the people about why we went in.  Before the invasion, they tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really related.  They really played on people's emotions about 9/11 to get support for the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when we attack first. I think this war is like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for what came next – the chaos and power vacuum.  They tried to put in a democracy, like they did in Vietnam, pushing out communism and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut they should have known it would be a long, hard fight. It's not like Vietnam was a clear victory, either. Even with support from some Iraqis, there were so many insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people. \n\nBasically, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to do it, we should have planned better. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there, almost at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police, but it's a slow process.  \n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, easy win, but it's not.  Building a new government takes time and struggle – just look at our own history. It wasn't easy to get to the government we have today.  \n\nSo, what now? It's tough because we've been there so long. How can we just leave them after we took their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free Iraq?\n\nIf we're going to make countries democratic, why just Iraq? Why not others? I think it's partly about oil – that's where we get it from.  \n\nWe thought Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they weren't there.  Meanwhile, we know North Korea has them, but we're not attacking them.  I don't think the government is being honest enough about its reasons.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there. But I'm not sure if that will happen.",
            "Um, let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I truly believe it's a personal choice, something that science is showing more and more is likely biological, not a matter of choice.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control. It's just not fair.  \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  I don't think politics or the government should have any say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens between two people, within their homes and families.\n\nYou know, back home, there are a couple of openly gay couples in my neighborhood. They aren't married because they aren't allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go about their day, just like everyone else. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to decide what marriage means and how it should be defined. It's their personal lives, not his to control.\n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be something that's actually in your genes, a chemical thing in your brain. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose.  It's different from growing up in a certain environment or with certain influences. That's the biological side of it versus the sociological side.\n\nThe biggest thing that bothers me is the double standard.  If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas, no big deal. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it becomes a huge public spectacle. It feels like it should be a private matter, something that doesn't need to be in the news or debated by politicians. It's not the government's business.",

They'd feel awful if they didn't act on it.  \n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not.  Sometimes people are just messing around, you know? Like maybe the situation at school was just a big misunderstanding - maybe it was a project gone wrong for a sociology class or something. Or maybe it was something really serious.\n\nWhat happened was, someone heard someone else talking about something at school and told the authorities.  Then, they found out who it was, and they looked through their Facebook. There were some things on there that were kinda dark, and even though the person might have meant them as a joke, in the situation it sounded really serious.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, there's no privacy.  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online! You can't control what people think or how they take things. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their stuff, but if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI mean, they shouldn't be listening to their students' phone calls or messages, but if someone tells them something, they have to do something about it. It's not cool for teachers to make fake profiles and friend their students, either - that's just wrong. I wouldn't want my residents to be able to see my life on Facebook, you know? It's just not my place to share that kind of stuff.",
            "This war has just dragged on for far too long.  I remember when we first started, the goal was good – to help bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to show everyone how powerful we are.\n\nHonestly, I even wonder about the reasons we started this in the first place.  There were those old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, weren't there?  If we truly wanted to bring democracy to a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason to fight. But if it was about personal grudges, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we made our point those first few months, when we began the war. That was a powerful statement in itself. But it's been years now, and it just seems to be going on and on.\n\nI think if our goal was to help a country ruled by a tyrant, that was a noble reason to start. But over time, I feel like our reasons have become blurred and confused. It feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing to win and declare victory.\n\nThis war has gone on long enough. It's time to stop.  Eventually, their government and people will have to figure things out on their own. We've already drained our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have so many problems right here at home – poverty, healthcare, education... These are things we should be using that money for.\n\nBillions and billions are being spent on a war that no longer has a clear purpose. We have our own problems that need attention, like fixing roads, improving schools, and taking care of our citizens.  It's heartbreaking to see our money being spent to kill our own people in a foreign country for a cause that has been lost.",
            "Okay, so basically, someone found out about something on Myspace that could have been really bad, and they stopped it from happening. Is it wrong to look at other people's Myspace profiles?  \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy. If you put stuff on Myspace, it's kind of public.  I mean, yeah, you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nWhen you post things online, you have to understand that lots of people might see them. So, I think it was actually good that someone saw that and stopped something bad from happening.\n\nBut, it's tough because you can't have someone watching everyone's Myspace all day. It wouldn't be fair to single out certain students and check their profiles just because they might be up to something.\n\nMaybe it depends on the situation. If someone was looking for something specific, like evidence of a student planning something dangerous, then maybe it's different. But if someone was just randomly looking through profiles, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook, and it worries me that there are people out there who can see all this information about me. I saw a story on TV about a guy who could easily find someone's personal information online and even get them to meet up with him in just a few minutes.\n\nI definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they seem to know so much about me - my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, even my friends.\n\nI try to be careful about what I post, but it's hard. I use Facebook to connect with friends, so I don't want to limit it too much.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what. It's a tricky issue. \n\nI heard that some high schools banned Myspace, which seems strange to me. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, but I don't know if they have the right to do that.",
            "Honestly, this whole Iraq War thing makes me feel kind of hypocritical. I mean, I hate to jump on the bandwagon and say I was against it from the start, but I was. It's just that now, it feels like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except maybe those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nEverywhere you look, the polls show it - Americans, Iraqis, people all over the world - about 75 to 80% think it was a mistake. Even a lot of the U.S. troops there think it was a bad call and we should get out. \n\nTo me, it's been a disaster from the get-go.  Even before we got involved, it was a mess, and now leaving is going to be another disaster.  It's like quicksand.  \n\nI think it's just a clash of cultures, you know?  The U.S. and the Middle East are so different. This administration, and even the ones before it, just don't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country.  It's just turned into a complete nightmare.\n\nFrankly, I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some hopeful ideas about staying, but I haven't heard a good one yet. If they want to pull out gradually, over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that.  But just leaving now seems like the best option. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them want us out now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. \n\nIf we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, at least we can't be blamed if things go bad. We could say, \"Well, you guys made the decision.\"\n\nAt least then, if we decide to help out later, we'll be seen as the good guys.  Well, maybe not the *good* guys, but better than we are now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender bias is still a real issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It often depends on the field you work in. \n\nI feel women face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, many struggle to find themselves leading a team with a woman at the top.  This is because of how society has always been, you know?  Women often have the skills and qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those high-powered roles.  \n\nAnd it's similar for men, too. Think about fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's uncommon to see a man at home taking care of the kids. People often criticize that choice because society expects men to be the breadwinners. \n\nIt can be tough on men who want to stay home with their children, especially if their wives are the ones with the better job. It's working for their family, but society doesn't always understand. \n\nIn fashion, some people might not take a straight male seriously if he's into it. Maybe it's because they think men who are into fashion have a different lifestyle. So, if a guy fits the stereotypical \"masculine\" mold and works in fashion, people might question his knowledge and expertise.\n\nSo, I believe there's definitely gender bias in the US, but it varies depending on the industry. \n\nChanging it is tough because society has deeply ingrained ideas. We've made progress, but it's slow. We're seeing more women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads becoming more accepted.  Slowly, people are starting to understand.\n\nTo really shift things, we need to highlight the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. We can't be pushy, but we need to show that these individuals are valuable and deserving of respect. \n\nIt's a delicate balance. Change takes time, and we're making progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "So, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list.  Now it's more like a ticket, you know, like parking. You get a citation, not hauled off to jail. I think, if you get caught now, it won't be as bad for your job or anything like that.  The big worries people have, especially the young ones, is what happens later, even after it's not a crime.  But, it costs a lot of money to arrest folks, take them to court, and deal with all that. It's a lot of money, money that could be used for schools or helping people.   Places that are struggling financially, they just don't want to part with that money, even if it means letting people go for smaller stuff. Some places are just against marijuana, no matter what.  But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it makes sense. They probably have more money now to spend on good things.\n\nI mean, you don't want marijuana everywhere, in every shop, like cigarettes. That would be a problem. But the money thing is important too. There are other reasons why it might not be good to be totally open about it, you know? Like, it's still not accepted in many places, and having it out in the open could feel weird.   \n\nUm, you know what I mean? What was that? I can't hear you well.\n\nI think alcohol is worse for your driving, but marijuana can mess with your whole life more. Both have bad effects, but people react differently. Some people can handle anything, and some can't. It's hard to say what's better or worse, because everyone is different.",
            "Hmm, I'd say being Catholic has its pros and cons. On one hand, they have strong traditions and stick to them, which can be good for stability. But it's also important to be open to change, you know? Like, a lot of Catholics are super strict about going to church every week and following the rules. Sometimes it feels like they judge those who don't follow everything perfectly or even people from other religions.  Take my parents for example, my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith. That doesn't seem very accepting to me, you know?  It's like they say to love everyone, but then they don't act like it. \n\nIt's like the rules sometimes seem old-fashioned and don't match up with what they preach.  \n\nSome people think letting priests marry would be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop bad things from happening.  I mean, people who hurt kids probably wouldn't stop just because they're married. It's a different kind of issue altogether.",
            "Hmmm... this whole thing, it's really got me thinking. I'm still not sure what I think about it all.\n\nIt's tough to say who's right or wrong, y'know? But this issue, it's the trickiest one we're facing right now. It's a real tangle between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.\n\nIt's hard to define marriage without upsetting someone.\n\nI dunno, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same way.\n\nMarriage, should the government even define it?\n\nI mean, if you get baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right?\n\nSo why should they care if you're married?\n\nTo me, it's just a civil union: two people who want to be together.\n\nThey shouldn't mix religion with government stuff.\n\nJust look at it as two people coming together.\n\nAnd, you know, with gay marriage...\n\nIt's just two people wanting to be together.\n\nShould they care what kind of marriage it is?\n\nIf all the states can agree on something sensible, they should make it a federal law.\n\nBut trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just silly.\n\nThe constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.\n\nIt's important to people, sure, but not important enough for a major change like that.\n\nIt just doesn't feel right to me.",
            "Hmm...this whole thing about homosexuality is kinda confusing for me.  You see, I grew up in a Christian family, so it's a bit of a grey area.  I have lots of gay friends, so I don't dislike them or anything.  I just don't personally agree with their lifestyle.\n\nBut, I do think they should have the right to marry.  It shouldn't be a big national issue, you know?  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to allow gay marriage.  It's not fair for the president to make that decision for the whole country.\n\nThink about it, some states are very liberal, and others are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, you kinda have to accept their views, right?  \n\nI believe everyone should have the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I think it should be up to each state to decide about gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's right for the president to ban it nationwide.  Each state should be able to make its own choice.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how they run things.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in who supports gay marriage, they can just overturn the ban.  It's just going to be a constant back-and-forth.  It's better to let each state decide for themselves.  They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Okay, so, think about it this way. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Anything you put on there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So, if school officials can see it, even if they aren't using the school's name, it's not really a big deal. \n\nI mean, if they're checking Myspace to make sure students aren't doing anything dangerous, like drinking or smoking, that's different. It's like they're trying to catch kids doing something wrong, which is kind of wrong. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay.  \n\nIt's all about keeping everyone safe, you know?  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and sometimes that means looking into things even if it feels a little bit like an invasion of privacy. \n\nPlus, think about it, if you post something on the internet, it's out there forever. Even if you delete it, someone could have already seen it.",
            "Okay, so, about this war... at first, I was totally for it. Nine Eleven hit me hard, you know? I was ready to dish out some payback, same as they did here. But looking back, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without a real plan, kinda unprepared. And it backfired big time. \n\nHonestly, I'm against it now. I don't think it achieved anything.  Those people over there, they're too busy fighting each other to bother with us.  They can't even get along, so what difference does us being there make?\n\nNine Eleven changed things for me. I just don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like they're not even human, the way they fight each other. They can't solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there blind, not knowing what we were facing. War for them is different than it is for us. They're savage. They're not trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, I think we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up by the whole thing, not thinking straight about the consequences. We were fueled by revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because the people wanted it. \n\nI get why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't just let them get away with it. But we should've had a better plan. We were disorganized and unclear about our goals. There was no unity. \n\nWe were driven by anger and emotion, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're capable of changing them. They'll always be like that.\n\nI've said enough. It's been dragging on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just fall apart again once we leave. We can't be there forever."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs to update its thinking in a few ways. \n\nFolks are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's partly because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. See, the Church has strong opinions on these matters, which is fine, but some of those views feel a bit outdated. \n\nI think if they were a bit more open-minded, they wouldn't have to worry about people leaving. \n\nI've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. They feel the Church has the wrong perspective. \n\nTake abortion, for example. If you believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable in a place that condemns it. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to belong to a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to marry.  But I'm not sure if that would have stopped recent scandals. \n\nIt's tough to say if being married or having women priests would have changed things. It's just hard to know.\n\nI mean, the Church says priests are \"married to God,\" but everyone else has a job and a family life. Why can't priests have both?",
            "Hmm...this whole gay marriage thing, you know? I'm not against it at all.  I just don't think it's a choice people make, like deciding to be this way or that.  It's just how they are, right?  So why should we judge them for it?  It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nTo be honest, I haven't really thought about it too much. But it just feels wrong to me, like saying someone's love is less valid because of who they love.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should be involved. It's not like a legal issue or a moral one, at least not in my opinion. It's just about people loving each other.  Why should we put them on display like they did something wrong?  We shouldn't be punishing people for who they are.\n\nIt just seems like the government has no business interfering in people's lives like this. It's about love, and love shouldn't be controlled.",
            "Okay, so like, I think gay marriage should totally be legal. Why not, right?  Some folks think gay couples are bad news for straight families, but that's just not true. They're different, you know? Like, two sides of the same coin - same thing, different flips.  It's all about rights, too.  Stuff like taxes and health care. Like, if you're sick, your partner can't be there for you if you're not officially family.  Isn't that crazy? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?  And studies show that gay couples are just as happy as straight couples.  It's the same deal! The thing is, people get hung up on this idea that gay marriage is about churches, but it's really just about a legal document.  Like, why can't the government recognize their relationship? It's like separate but unequal - it doesn't make sense.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and stuff, but honestly, gay parents are just like straight parents. They love their kids, they care for them.  It's about the individuals, not their sexual orientation.  I've heard stories about kids of gay parents getting bullied, which is awful.  But that's society's problem, not the parents.\n\nThe government should totally get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about basic rights and equality.  It's frustrating that some people base their opinions on religion and morality, but everyone's beliefs are different.  It's not fair to impose one group's views on everyone else. And honestly, some people think gay people are broken or damaged, which is just wrong. Science has proven that's not true.",
            "Okay, so like, I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. And you know, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be good for you, right?  I mean, I don't think it should be legal for everyone to just buy it, no way. But for medicine, I think it should be okay.  It's not like just because it's illegal, it's automatically bad.  There are lots of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet – those are all controlled, but we use them all the time because they help people.  It's kinda messed up to say it's not okay just because people have a bad image of marijuana.  We gotta look at the good stuff it can do.\n\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though, because you can really get addicted to it if you're not careful. But you can with alcohol too, so it's tricky.  Maybe we should make it legal gradually, not all at once, you know?  That way people can get used to it and learn to use it responsibly.  \n\nPeople think marijuana is so bad just because it's illegal. But it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine, for sure. If we change how people think about it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "Hmm... you know, I think churches have changed a lot since, like, the early 2000s. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was little, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore these cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, you know, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, and all my friends were there on the weekends. We'd just hang out. But now, they have this thing called Teen Mass – it's only thirty minutes long! And people dress so casually, especially in the summer. They come straight from the beach, in their swimsuits! Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up fancy, now people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.  \n\nOh, and I don't really know about all the church politics, but yeah, that's basically it. \n\nAs for those accusations against priests, I don't think letting women be priests or letting priests get married would have stopped that.  Some married men become pedophiles too, right? It's not about whether they're married or not. It's about the person.\n\nI mean, there are religions where priests can get married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  They have ministers who are married.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could look into a different religion.\n\nI think it's mostly genetic, you know? People are born that way. Maybe their upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly in their genes. You can't really change that even with marriage.",
            "Ugh,  you know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still super shaken up from 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses.  The Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was involved with Osama Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out to be a big lie. It really makes me mad! \n\nI just think the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN about it, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong, you know? It feels like they don't even care about the Constitution anymore. \n\nI think they went into office wanting to go to war.  There was even this guy, the Treasury Secretary, who wrote a book after he got kicked out of office, saying basically that. It seems like George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad. Plus, I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. \n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out right now could cause chaos and more people getting hurt. It seems they're trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize things, but I don't know if that's a good idea either. It could mess up Iraq's sovereignty even more.\n\nThe government there is falling apart. The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has a lot of seats in Parliament. It's all so complicated and messy.",
            "So, like, I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless, you know? It wasn't even a real war, like, they never officially declared it. It just feels like we went in there to get back at them for 9/11, like we were just punishing them. \n\nI don't follow the war too closely, so I don't know all the details. But it seems like we're just staying there to try and build democracy, which is a good thing, I guess, but it's taking forever. And then there's the oil, which is like, a major factor. \n\nBut honestly, it's just making everyone unhappy. If we stay, we're stuck trying to force democracy on them, which isn't going to happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad because we messed everything up and left them to deal with it on their own. It's a total mess.\n\nThis is a tough one, because I don't really know what to think. I feel bad for the soldiers and their families, and I want them to be safe. But I also worry about how this is making everyone feel. It's like we're creating more problems than we're solving.\n\nI think it's important to help, but it feels like we're just prolonging the conflict. And honestly, it's making Bush look bad. This could end up being another Vietnam, where we're seen as the bad guys.",
            "Okay, so I just don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or illegal.  I mean, our constitution clearly states separation of church and state, right? To try and make laws about this would be going against what's already written.  \n\nIt seems to me like people pushing to make it illegal are just picking one church's beliefs over others. Like, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some spots like Boston.  But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is super important for religious freedom in the US.  Even trying to make an amendment about this would be wrong, because it would go against the constitution and it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The guy pushing for this amendment is just trying to force his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any politician. There's no good reason to ban it, it won't help the economy or anything, and it might even be good for society.",
            "Ok, so about the war in Iraq... I don't think our government was totally straight with the people about why we went in.  Before the invasion, they tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really related.  They really played on people's emotions about 9/11 to get support for the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when we attack first. I think this war is like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for what came next – the chaos and power vacuum.  They tried to put in a democracy, like they did in Vietnam, pushing out communism and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut they should have known it would be a long, hard fight. It's not like Vietnam was a clear victory, either. Even with support from some Iraqis, there were so many insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people. \n\nBasically, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to do it, we should have planned better. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there, almost at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police, but it's a slow process.  \n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, easy win, but it's not.  Building a new government takes time and struggle – just look at our own history. It wasn't easy to get to the government we have today.  \n\nSo, what now? It's tough because we've been there so long. How can we just leave them after we took their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free Iraq?\n\nIf we're going to make countries democratic, why just Iraq? Why not others? I think it's partly about oil – that's where we get it from.  \n\nWe thought Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they weren't there.  Meanwhile, we know North Korea has them, but we're not attacking them.  I don't think the government is being honest enough about its reasons.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there. But I'm not sure if that will happen.",
            "Um, let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I truly believe it's a personal choice, something that science is showing more and more is likely biological, not a matter of choice.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control. It's just not fair.  \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  I don't think politics or the government should have any say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens between two people, within their homes and families.\n\nYou know, back home, there are a couple of openly gay couples in my neighborhood. They aren't married because they aren't allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go about their day, just like everyone else. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to decide what marriage means and how it should be defined. It's their personal lives, not his to control.\n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be something that's actually in your genes, a chemical thing in your brain. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose.  It's different from growing up in a certain environment or with certain influences. That's the biological side of it versus the sociological side.\n\nThe biggest thing that bothers me is the double standard.  If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas, no big deal. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it becomes a huge public spectacle. It feels like it should be a private matter, something that doesn't need to be in the news or debated by politicians. It's not the government's business.",

They'd feel awful if they didn't act on it.  \n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not.  Sometimes people are just messing around, you know? Like maybe the situation at school was just a big misunderstanding - maybe it was a project gone wrong for a sociology class or something. Or maybe it was something really serious.\n\nWhat happened was, someone heard someone else talking about something at school and told the authorities.  Then, they found out who it was, and they looked through their Facebook. There were some things on there that were kinda dark, and even though the person might have meant them as a joke, in the situation it sounded really serious.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, there's no privacy.  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online! You can't control what people think or how they take things. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their stuff, but if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI mean, they shouldn't be listening to their students' phone calls or messages, but if someone tells them something, they have to do something about it. It's not cool for teachers to make fake profiles and friend their students, either - that's just wrong. I wouldn't want my residents to be able to see my life on Facebook, you know? It's just not my place to share that kind of stuff.",
            "This war has just dragged on for far too long.  I remember when we first started, the goal was good – to help bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to show everyone how powerful we are.\n\nHonestly, I even wonder about the reasons we started this in the first place.  There were those old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, weren't there?  If we truly wanted to bring democracy to a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason to fight. But if it was about personal grudges, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we made our point those first few months, when we began the war. That was a powerful statement in itself. But it's been years now, and it just seems to be going on and on.\n\nI think if our goal was to help a country ruled by a tyrant, that was a noble reason to start. But over time, I feel like our reasons have become blurred and confused. It feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing to win and declare victory.\n\nThis war has gone on long enough. It's time to stop.  Eventually, their government and people will have to figure things out on their own. We've already drained our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have so many problems right here at home – poverty, healthcare, education... These are things we should be using that money for.\n\nBillions and billions are being spent on a war that no longer has a clear purpose. We have our own problems that need attention, like fixing roads, improving schools, and taking care of our citizens.  It's heartbreaking to see our money being spent to kill our own people in a foreign country for a cause that has been lost.",
            "Okay, so basically, someone found out about something on Myspace that could have been really bad, and they stopped it from happening. Is it wrong to look at other people's Myspace profiles?  \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy. If you put stuff on Myspace, it's kind of public.  I mean, yeah, you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nWhen you post things online, you have to understand that lots of people might see them. So, I think it was actually good that someone saw that and stopped something bad from happening.\n\nBut, it's tough because you can't have someone watching everyone's Myspace all day. It wouldn't be fair to single out certain students and check their profiles just because they might be up to something.\n\nMaybe it depends on the situation. If someone was looking for something specific, like evidence of a student planning something dangerous, then maybe it's different. But if someone was just randomly looking through profiles, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook, and it worries me that there are people out there who can see all this information about me. I saw a story on TV about a guy who could easily find someone's personal information online and even get them to meet up with him in just a few minutes.\n\nI definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they seem to know so much about me - my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, even my friends.\n\nI try to be careful about what I post, but it's hard. I use Facebook to connect with friends, so I don't want to limit it too much.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what. It's a tricky issue. \n\nI heard that some high schools banned Myspace, which seems strange to me. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, but I don't know if they have the right to do that.",
            "Honestly, this whole Iraq War thing makes me feel kind of hypocritical. I mean, I hate to jump on the bandwagon and say I was against it from the start, but I was. It's just that now, it feels like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except maybe those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nEverywhere you look, the polls show it - Americans, Iraqis, people all over the world - about 75 to 80% think it was a mistake. Even a lot of the U.S. troops there think it was a bad call and we should get out. \n\nTo me, it's been a disaster from the get-go.  Even before we got involved, it was a mess, and now leaving is going to be another disaster.  It's like quicksand.  \n\nI think it's just a clash of cultures, you know?  The U.S. and the Middle East are so different. This administration, and even the ones before it, just don't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country.  It's just turned into a complete nightmare.\n\nFrankly, I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some hopeful ideas about staying, but I haven't heard a good one yet. If they want to pull out gradually, over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that.  But just leaving now seems like the best option. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them want us out now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. \n\nIf we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, at least we can't be blamed if things go bad. We could say, \"Well, you guys made the decision.\"\n\nAt least then, if we decide to help out later, we'll be seen as the good guys.  Well, maybe not the *good* guys, but better than we are now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender bias is still a real issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It often depends on the field you work in. \n\nI feel women face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, many struggle to find themselves leading a team with a woman at the top.  This is because of how society has always been, you know?  Women often have the skills and qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those high-powered roles.  \n\nAnd it's similar for men, too. Think about fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's uncommon to see a man at home taking care of the kids. People often criticize that choice because society expects men to be the breadwinners. \n\nIt can be tough on men who want to stay home with their children, especially if their wives are the ones with the better job. It's working for their family, but society doesn't always understand. \n\nIn fashion, some people might not take a straight male seriously if he's into it. Maybe it's because they think men who are into fashion have a different lifestyle. So, if a guy fits the stereotypical \"masculine\" mold and works in fashion, people might question his knowledge and expertise.\n\nSo, I believe there's definitely gender bias in the US, but it varies depending on the industry. \n\nChanging it is tough because society has deeply ingrained ideas. We've made progress, but it's slow. We're seeing more women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads becoming more accepted.  Slowly, people are starting to understand.\n\nTo really shift things, we need to highlight the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. We can't be pushy, but we need to show that these individuals are valuable and deserving of respect. \n\nIt's a delicate balance. Change takes time, and we're making progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "So, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list.  Now it's more like a ticket, you know, like parking. You get a citation, not hauled off to jail. I think, if you get caught now, it won't be as bad for your job or anything like that.  The big worries people have, especially the young ones, is what happens later, even after it's not a crime.  But, it costs a lot of money to arrest folks, take them to court, and deal with all that. It's a lot of money, money that could be used for schools or helping people.   Places that are struggling financially, they just don't want to part with that money, even if it means letting people go for smaller stuff. Some places are just against marijuana, no matter what.  But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it makes sense. They probably have more money now to spend on good things.\n\nI mean, you don't want marijuana everywhere, in every shop, like cigarettes. That would be a problem. But the money thing is important too. There are other reasons why it might not be good to be totally open about it, you know? Like, it's still not accepted in many places, and having it out in the open could feel weird.   \n\nUm, you know what I mean? What was that? I can't hear you well.\n\nI think alcohol is worse for your driving, but marijuana can mess with your whole life more. Both have bad effects, but people react differently. Some people can handle anything, and some can't. It's hard to say what's better or worse, because everyone is different.",
            "Hmm, I'd say being Catholic has its pros and cons. On one hand, they have strong traditions and stick to them, which can be good for stability. But it's also important to be open to change, you know? Like, a lot of Catholics are super strict about going to church every week and following the rules. Sometimes it feels like they judge those who don't follow everything perfectly or even people from other religions.  Take my parents for example, my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith. That doesn't seem very accepting to me, you know?  It's like they say to love everyone, but then they don't act like it. \n\nIt's like the rules sometimes seem old-fashioned and don't match up with what they preach.  \n\nSome people think letting priests marry would be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop bad things from happening.  I mean, people who hurt kids probably wouldn't stop just because they're married. It's a different kind of issue altogether.",
            "Hmmm... this whole thing, it's really got me thinking. I'm still not sure what I think about it all.\n\nIt's tough to say who's right or wrong, y'know? But this issue, it's the trickiest one we're facing right now. It's a real tangle between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.\n\nIt's hard to define marriage without upsetting someone.\n\nI dunno, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same way.\n\nMarriage, should the government even define it?\n\nI mean, if you get baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right?\n\nSo why should they care if you're married?\n\nTo me, it's just a civil union: two people who want to be together.\n\nThey shouldn't mix religion with government stuff.\n\nJust look at it as two people coming together.\n\nAnd, you know, with gay marriage...\n\nIt's just two people wanting to be together.\n\nShould they care what kind of marriage it is?\n\nIf all the states can agree on something sensible, they should make it a federal law.\n\nBut trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just silly.\n\nThe constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.\n\nIt's important to people, sure, but not important enough for a major change like that.\n\nIt just doesn't feel right to me.",
            "Hmm...this whole thing about homosexuality is kinda confusing for me.  You see, I grew up in a Christian family, so it's a bit of a grey area.  I have lots of gay friends, so I don't dislike them or anything.  I just don't personally agree with their lifestyle.\n\nBut, I do think they should have the right to marry.  It shouldn't be a big national issue, you know?  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to allow gay marriage.  It's not fair for the president to make that decision for the whole country.\n\nThink about it, some states are very liberal, and others are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, you kinda have to accept their views, right?  \n\nI believe everyone should have the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I think it should be up to each state to decide about gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's right for the president to ban it nationwide.  Each state should be able to make its own choice.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how they run things.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in who supports gay marriage, they can just overturn the ban.  It's just going to be a constant back-and-forth.  It's better to let each state decide for themselves.  They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Okay, so, think about it this way. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Anything you put on there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So, if school officials can see it, even if they aren't using the school's name, it's not really a big deal. \n\nI mean, if they're checking Myspace to make sure students aren't doing anything dangerous, like drinking or smoking, that's different. It's like they're trying to catch kids doing something wrong, which is kind of wrong. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay.  \n\nIt's all about keeping everyone safe, you know?  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and sometimes that means looking into things even if it feels a little bit like an invasion of privacy. \n\nPlus, think about it, if you post something on the internet, it's out there forever. Even if you delete it, someone could have already seen it.",
            "Okay, so, about this war... at first, I was totally for it. Nine Eleven hit me hard, you know? I was ready to dish out some payback, same as they did here. But looking back, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without a real plan, kinda unprepared. And it backfired big time. \n\nHonestly, I'm against it now. I don't think it achieved anything.  Those people over there, they're too busy fighting each other to bother with us.  They can't even get along, so what difference does us being there make?\n\nNine Eleven changed things for me. I just don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like they're not even human, the way they fight each other. They can't solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there blind, not knowing what we were facing. War for them is different than it is for us. They're savage. They're not trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, I think we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up by the whole thing, not thinking straight about the consequences. We were fueled by revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because the people wanted it. \n\nI get why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't just let them get away with it. But we should've had a better plan. We were disorganized and unclear about our goals. There was no unity. \n\nWe were driven by anger and emotion, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're capable of changing them. They'll always be like that.\n\nI've said enough. It's been dragging on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just fall apart again once we leave. We can't be there forever."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs to update its thinking in a few ways. \n\nFolks are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's partly because they aren't very accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. See, the Church has strong opinions on these matters, which is fine, but some of those views feel a bit outdated. \n\nI think if they were a bit more open-minded, they wouldn't have to worry about people leaving. \n\nI've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. They feel the Church has the wrong perspective. \n\nTake abortion, for example. If you believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable in a place that condemns it. It's the same with gay marriage. If you support it, you might not want to belong to a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to marry.  But I'm not sure if that would have stopped recent scandals. \n\nIt's tough to say if being married or having women priests would have changed things. It's just hard to know.\n\nI mean, the Church says priests are \"married to God,\" but everyone else has a job and a family life. Why can't priests have both?",
            "Hmm...this whole gay marriage thing, you know? I'm not against it at all.  I just don't think it's a choice people make, like deciding to be this way or that.  It's just how they are, right?  So why should we judge them for it?  It seems unfair to say a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nTo be honest, I haven't really thought about it too much. But it just feels wrong to me, like saying someone's love is less valid because of who they love.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should be involved. It's not like a legal issue or a moral one, at least not in my opinion. It's just about people loving each other.  Why should we put them on display like they did something wrong?  We shouldn't be punishing people for who they are.\n\nIt just seems like the government has no business interfering in people's lives like this. It's about love, and love shouldn't be controlled.",
            "Okay, so like, I think gay marriage should totally be legal. Why not, right?  Some folks think gay couples are bad news for straight families, but that's just not true. They're different, you know? Like, two sides of the same coin - same thing, different flips.  It's all about rights, too.  Stuff like taxes and health care. Like, if you're sick, your partner can't be there for you if you're not officially family.  Isn't that crazy? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?  And studies show that gay couples are just as happy as straight couples.  It's the same deal! The thing is, people get hung up on this idea that gay marriage is about churches, but it's really just about a legal document.  Like, why can't the government recognize their relationship? It's like separate but unequal - it doesn't make sense.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and stuff, but honestly, gay parents are just like straight parents. They love their kids, they care for them.  It's about the individuals, not their sexual orientation.  I've heard stories about kids of gay parents getting bullied, which is awful.  But that's society's problem, not the parents.\n\nThe government should totally get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about basic rights and equality.  It's frustrating that some people base their opinions on religion and morality, but everyone's beliefs are different.  It's not fair to impose one group's views on everyone else. And honestly, some people think gay people are broken or damaged, which is just wrong. Science has proven that's not true.",
            "Okay, so like, I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. And you know, just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be good for you, right?  I mean, I don't think it should be legal for everyone to just buy it, no way. But for medicine, I think it should be okay.  It's not like just because it's illegal, it's automatically bad.  There are lots of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet – those are all controlled, but we use them all the time because they help people.  It's kinda messed up to say it's not okay just because people have a bad image of marijuana.  We gotta look at the good stuff it can do.\n\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though, because you can really get addicted to it if you're not careful. But you can with alcohol too, so it's tricky.  Maybe we should make it legal gradually, not all at once, you know?  That way people can get used to it and learn to use it responsibly.  \n\nPeople think marijuana is so bad just because it's illegal. But it's not as bad as heroin or cocaine, for sure. If we change how people think about it, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "Hmm... you know, I think churches have changed a lot since, like, the early 2000s. They're not as strict as they used to be. When I was little, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore these cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, you know, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, and all my friends were there on the weekends. We'd just hang out. But now, they have this thing called Teen Mass – it's only thirty minutes long! And people dress so casually, especially in the summer. They come straight from the beach, in their swimsuits! Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress up fancy, now people wear jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed.  That's the biggest change I've noticed.  \n\nOh, and I don't really know about all the church politics, but yeah, that's basically it. \n\nAs for those accusations against priests, I don't think letting women be priests or letting priests get married would have stopped that.  Some married men become pedophiles too, right? It's not about whether they're married or not. It's about the person.\n\nI mean, there are religions where priests can get married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  They have ministers who are married.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, they could look into a different religion.\n\nI think it's mostly genetic, you know? People are born that way. Maybe their upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly in their genes. You can't really change that even with marriage.",
            "Ugh,  you know, I was okay with the idea at first, but everyone was still super shaken up from 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses.  The Bush administration kept saying Saddam Hussein was involved with Osama Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but it turned out to be a big lie. It really makes me mad! \n\nI just think the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN about it, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong, you know? It feels like they don't even care about the Constitution anymore. \n\nI think they went into office wanting to go to war.  There was even this guy, the Treasury Secretary, who wrote a book after he got kicked out of office, saying basically that. It seems like George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad. Plus, I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil. \n\nThis whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out right now could cause chaos and more people getting hurt. It seems they're trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize things, but I don't know if that's a good idea either. It could mess up Iraq's sovereignty even more.\n\nThe government there is falling apart. The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has a lot of seats in Parliament. It's all so complicated and messy.",
            "So, like, I'm not really sure what to say about the war in Iraq. It feels pointless, you know? It wasn't even a real war, like, they never officially declared it. It just feels like we went in there to get back at them for 9/11, like we were just punishing them. \n\nI don't follow the war too closely, so I don't know all the details. But it seems like we're just staying there to try and build democracy, which is a good thing, I guess, but it's taking forever. And then there's the oil, which is like, a major factor. \n\nBut honestly, it's just making everyone unhappy. If we stay, we're stuck trying to force democracy on them, which isn't going to happen overnight. And if we leave, they'll be mad because we messed everything up and left them to deal with it on their own. It's a total mess.\n\nThis is a tough one, because I don't really know what to think. I feel bad for the soldiers and their families, and I want them to be safe. But I also worry about how this is making everyone feel. It's like we're creating more problems than we're solving.\n\nI think it's important to help, but it feels like we're just prolonging the conflict. And honestly, it's making Bush look bad. This could end up being another Vietnam, where we're seen as the bad guys.",
            "Okay, so I just don't think it's right for the government to make this legal or illegal.  I mean, our constitution clearly states separation of church and state, right? To try and make laws about this would be going against what's already written.  \n\nIt seems to me like people pushing to make it illegal are just picking one church's beliefs over others. Like, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some spots like Boston.  But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is super important for religious freedom in the US.  Even trying to make an amendment about this would be wrong, because it would go against the constitution and it would be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think any government should be involved in this.  The guy pushing for this amendment is just trying to force his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else.  It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any politician. There's no good reason to ban it, it won't help the economy or anything, and it might even be good for society.",
            "Ok, so about the war in Iraq... I don't think our government was totally straight with the people about why we went in.  Before the invasion, they tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really related.  They really played on people's emotions about 9/11 to get support for the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when we attack first. I think this war is like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and took out the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for what came next – the chaos and power vacuum.  They tried to put in a democracy, like they did in Vietnam, pushing out communism and trying to make democracy work.  \n\nBut they should have known it would be a long, hard fight. It's not like Vietnam was a clear victory, either. Even with support from some Iraqis, there were so many insurgents. It's hard to fight a war against your own people. \n\nBasically, I think we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if we were going to do it, we should have planned better. They weren't ready for what happened after they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there, almost at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. They're trying to train Iraqi troops and police, but it's a slow process.  \n\nI think the government tried to make it seem like it would be a quick, easy win, but it's not.  Building a new government takes time and struggle – just look at our own history. It wasn't easy to get to the government we have today.  \n\nSo, what now? It's tough because we've been there so long. How can we just leave them after we took their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to risk for a free Iraq?\n\nIf we're going to make countries democratic, why just Iraq? Why not others? I think it's partly about oil – that's where we get it from.  \n\nWe thought Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they weren't there.  Meanwhile, we know North Korea has them, but we're not attacking them.  I don't think the government is being honest enough about its reasons.  \n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace there. But I'm not sure if that will happen.",
            "Um, let me tell you, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I truly believe it's a personal choice, something that science is showing more and more is likely biological, not a matter of choice.  It just feels wrong to take away someone's rights based on something they can't control. It's just not fair.  \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage.  I don't think politics or the government should have any say in this. It's a personal matter, something that happens between two people, within their homes and families.\n\nYou know, back home, there are a couple of openly gay couples in my neighborhood. They aren't married because they aren't allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go about their day, just like everyone else. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that someone like Bush wants to decide what marriage means and how it should be defined. It's their personal lives, not his to control.\n\nI've read and heard a lot about how being gay might be something that's actually in your genes, a chemical thing in your brain. It could be something you're born with, not something you choose.  It's different from growing up in a certain environment or with certain influences. That's the biological side of it versus the sociological side.\n\nThe biggest thing that bothers me is the double standard.  If a guy and a girl want to get married, they can just elope to Vegas, no big deal. But if two gay people want to do the same thing, it becomes a huge public spectacle. It feels like it should be a private matter, something that doesn't need to be in the news or debated by politicians. It's not the government's business.",

They'd feel awful if they didn't act on it.  \n\nBut then again, it's hard to know what's serious and what's not.  Sometimes people are just messing around, you know? Like maybe the situation at school was just a big misunderstanding - maybe it was a project gone wrong for a sociology class or something. Or maybe it was something really serious.\n\nWhat happened was, someone heard someone else talking about something at school and told the authorities.  Then, they found out who it was, and they looked through their Facebook. There were some things on there that were kinda dark, and even though the person might have meant them as a joke, in the situation it sounded really serious.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, there's no privacy.  If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online! You can't control what people think or how they take things. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their stuff, but if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nI mean, they shouldn't be listening to their students' phone calls or messages, but if someone tells them something, they have to do something about it. It's not cool for teachers to make fake profiles and friend their students, either - that's just wrong. I wouldn't want my residents to be able to see my life on Facebook, you know? It's just not my place to share that kind of stuff.",
            "This war has just dragged on for far too long.  I remember when we first started, the goal was good – to help bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to show everyone how powerful we are.\n\nHonestly, I even wonder about the reasons we started this in the first place.  There were those old issues between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, weren't there?  If we truly wanted to bring democracy to a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason to fight. But if it was about personal grudges, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we made our point those first few months, when we began the war. That was a powerful statement in itself. But it's been years now, and it just seems to be going on and on.\n\nI think if our goal was to help a country ruled by a tyrant, that was a noble reason to start. But over time, I feel like our reasons have become blurred and confused. It feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting, needing to win and declare victory.\n\nThis war has gone on long enough. It's time to stop.  Eventually, their government and people will have to figure things out on their own. We've already drained our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have so many problems right here at home – poverty, healthcare, education... These are things we should be using that money for.\n\nBillions and billions are being spent on a war that no longer has a clear purpose. We have our own problems that need attention, like fixing roads, improving schools, and taking care of our citizens.  It's heartbreaking to see our money being spent to kill our own people in a foreign country for a cause that has been lost.",
            "Okay, so basically, someone found out about something on Myspace that could have been really bad, and they stopped it from happening. Is it wrong to look at other people's Myspace profiles?  \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy. If you put stuff on Myspace, it's kind of public.  I mean, yeah, you need to be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nWhen you post things online, you have to understand that lots of people might see them. So, I think it was actually good that someone saw that and stopped something bad from happening.\n\nBut, it's tough because you can't have someone watching everyone's Myspace all day. It wouldn't be fair to single out certain students and check their profiles just because they might be up to something.\n\nMaybe it depends on the situation. If someone was looking for something specific, like evidence of a student planning something dangerous, then maybe it's different. But if someone was just randomly looking through profiles, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook, and it worries me that there are people out there who can see all this information about me. I saw a story on TV about a guy who could easily find someone's personal information online and even get them to meet up with him in just a few minutes.\n\nI definitely wouldn't do that! I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. It's creepy because they seem to know so much about me - my interests, what I look like, my class schedule, even my friends.\n\nI try to be careful about what I post, but it's hard. I use Facebook to connect with friends, so I don't want to limit it too much.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who can see what. It's a tricky issue. \n\nI heard that some high schools banned Myspace, which seems strange to me. How can the school tell students they can't have a Myspace? I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, but I don't know if they have the right to do that.",
            "Honestly, this whole Iraq War thing makes me feel kind of hypocritical. I mean, I hate to jump on the bandwagon and say I was against it from the start, but I was. It's just that now, it feels like everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except maybe those in power who don't want to admit they were wrong.  \n\nEverywhere you look, the polls show it - Americans, Iraqis, people all over the world - about 75 to 80% think it was a mistake. Even a lot of the U.S. troops there think it was a bad call and we should get out. \n\nTo me, it's been a disaster from the get-go.  Even before we got involved, it was a mess, and now leaving is going to be another disaster.  It's like quicksand.  \n\nI think it's just a clash of cultures, you know?  The U.S. and the Middle East are so different. This administration, and even the ones before it, just don't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't fit.  \n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country.  It's just turned into a complete nightmare.\n\nFrankly, I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some hopeful ideas about staying, but I haven't heard a good one yet. If they want to pull out gradually, over a year or so, I wouldn't mind that.  But just leaving now seems like the best option. \n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them want us out now. They're the ones we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. \n\nIf we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, at least we can't be blamed if things go bad. We could say, \"Well, you guys made the decision.\"\n\nAt least then, if we decide to help out later, we'll be seen as the good guys.  Well, maybe not the *good* guys, but better than we are now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender bias is still a real issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. It often depends on the field you work in. \n\nI feel women face a tougher time because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is the goal, many struggle to find themselves leading a team with a woman at the top.  This is because of how society has always been, you know?  Women often have the skills and qualifications for a higher position, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those high-powered roles.  \n\nAnd it's similar for men, too. Think about fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's uncommon to see a man at home taking care of the kids. People often criticize that choice because society expects men to be the breadwinners. \n\nIt can be tough on men who want to stay home with their children, especially if their wives are the ones with the better job. It's working for their family, but society doesn't always understand. \n\nIn fashion, some people might not take a straight male seriously if he's into it. Maybe it's because they think men who are into fashion have a different lifestyle. So, if a guy fits the stereotypical \"masculine\" mold and works in fashion, people might question his knowledge and expertise.\n\nSo, I believe there's definitely gender bias in the US, but it varies depending on the industry. \n\nChanging it is tough because society has deeply ingrained ideas. We've made progress, but it's slow. We're seeing more women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads becoming more accepted.  Slowly, people are starting to understand.\n\nTo really shift things, we need to highlight the good qualities of those who are stereotyped. We can't be pushy, but we need to show that these individuals are valuable and deserving of respect. \n\nIt's a delicate balance. Change takes time, and we're making progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "So, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list.  Now it's more like a ticket, you know, like parking. You get a citation, not hauled off to jail. I think, if you get caught now, it won't be as bad for your job or anything like that.  The big worries people have, especially the young ones, is what happens later, even after it's not a crime.  But, it costs a lot of money to arrest folks, take them to court, and deal with all that. It's a lot of money, money that could be used for schools or helping people.   Places that are struggling financially, they just don't want to part with that money, even if it means letting people go for smaller stuff. Some places are just against marijuana, no matter what.  But in places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it makes sense. They probably have more money now to spend on good things.\n\nI mean, you don't want marijuana everywhere, in every shop, like cigarettes. That would be a problem. But the money thing is important too. There are other reasons why it might not be good to be totally open about it, you know? Like, it's still not accepted in many places, and having it out in the open could feel weird.   \n\nUm, you know what I mean? What was that? I can't hear you well.\n\nI think alcohol is worse for your driving, but marijuana can mess with your whole life more. Both have bad effects, but people react differently. Some people can handle anything, and some can't. It's hard to say what's better or worse, because everyone is different.",
            "Hmm, I'd say being Catholic has its pros and cons. On one hand, they have strong traditions and stick to them, which can be good for stability. But it's also important to be open to change, you know? Like, a lot of Catholics are super strict about going to church every week and following the rules. Sometimes it feels like they judge those who don't follow everything perfectly or even people from other religions.  Take my parents for example, my mom was Catholic and my dad was Episcopalian. They wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith. That doesn't seem very accepting to me, you know?  It's like they say to love everyone, but then they don't act like it. \n\nIt's like the rules sometimes seem old-fashioned and don't match up with what they preach.  \n\nSome people think letting priests marry would be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop bad things from happening.  I mean, people who hurt kids probably wouldn't stop just because they're married. It's a different kind of issue altogether.",
            "Hmmm... this whole thing, it's really got me thinking. I'm still not sure what I think about it all.\n\nIt's tough to say who's right or wrong, y'know? But this issue, it's the trickiest one we're facing right now. It's a real tangle between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.\n\nIt's hard to define marriage without upsetting someone.\n\nI dunno, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same way.\n\nMarriage, should the government even define it?\n\nI mean, if you get baptized, they don't give you special tax breaks or anything, right?\n\nSo why should they care if you're married?\n\nTo me, it's just a civil union: two people who want to be together.\n\nThey shouldn't mix religion with government stuff.\n\nJust look at it as two people coming together.\n\nAnd, you know, with gay marriage...\n\nIt's just two people wanting to be together.\n\nShould they care what kind of marriage it is?\n\nIf all the states can agree on something sensible, they should make it a federal law.\n\nBut trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just silly.\n\nThe constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.\n\nIt's important to people, sure, but not important enough for a major change like that.\n\nIt just doesn't feel right to me.",
            "Hmm...this whole thing about homosexuality is kinda confusing for me.  You see, I grew up in a Christian family, so it's a bit of a grey area.  I have lots of gay friends, so I don't dislike them or anything.  I just don't personally agree with their lifestyle.\n\nBut, I do think they should have the right to marry.  It shouldn't be a big national issue, you know?  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to allow gay marriage.  It's not fair for the president to make that decision for the whole country.\n\nThink about it, some states are very liberal, and others are more conservative.  Liberal states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, you kinda have to accept their views, right?  \n\nI believe everyone should have the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I think it should be up to each state to decide about gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's right for the president to ban it nationwide.  Each state should be able to make its own choice.  He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how they run things.\n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in who supports gay marriage, they can just overturn the ban.  It's just going to be a constant back-and-forth.  It's better to let each state decide for themselves.  They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Okay, so, think about it this way. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? Anything you put on there is for everyone to see, not just your friends.  So, if school officials can see it, even if they aren't using the school's name, it's not really a big deal. \n\nI mean, if they're checking Myspace to make sure students aren't doing anything dangerous, like drinking or smoking, that's different. It's like they're trying to catch kids doing something wrong, which is kind of wrong. But if they're trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay.  \n\nIt's all about keeping everyone safe, you know?  Schools have a responsibility to protect their students, and sometimes that means looking into things even if it feels a little bit like an invasion of privacy. \n\nPlus, think about it, if you post something on the internet, it's out there forever. Even if you delete it, someone could have already seen it.",
            "Okay, so, about this war... at first, I was totally for it. Nine Eleven hit me hard, you know? I was ready to dish out some payback, same as they did here. But looking back, I think our emotions got the best of us. We jumped in without a real plan, kinda unprepared. And it backfired big time. \n\nHonestly, I'm against it now. I don't think it achieved anything.  Those people over there, they're too busy fighting each other to bother with us.  They can't even get along, so what difference does us being there make?\n\nNine Eleven changed things for me. I just don't care what happens to them anymore. It's like they're not even human, the way they fight each other. They can't solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there blind, not knowing what we were facing. War for them is different than it is for us. They're savage. They're not trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, I think we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up by the whole thing, not thinking straight about the consequences. We were fueled by revenge, and President Bush just went along with it because the people wanted it. \n\nI get why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't just let them get away with it. But we should've had a better plan. We were disorganized and unclear about our goals. There was no unity. \n\nWe were driven by anger and emotion, and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're capable of changing them. They'll always be like that.\n\nI've said enough. It's been dragging on for too long. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just fall apart again once we leave. We can't be there forever."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church needs to update some of its ideas.  \n\nA lot of people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very open-minded about things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but they seem a bit stuck in the past.\n\nIf they were more open to modern thinking, I think they wouldn't worry so much about losing people. I've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with its stance on these topics. They feel like the Church is wrong about these things.\n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a place where it's seen as completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage - if you support that, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the scandals we've seen. It's hard to say for sure if things would be different.\n\n\nIt just seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.",
            "Ehm...you know, I'm okay with gay marriage.  I don't think it's something you choose, like it's just how you are, ya know?  I don't think we should blame people for being gay. So, it feels wrong to say that a man and woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. It just doesn't seem fair.\n\nHonestly, I haven't thought about this too much, but I feel like it's wrong to say that. It's not like someone decides to be gay, right?  Just like I was born straight, someone else might be born gay.  It's not a choice.\n\n(clears throat) Yeah, I think it's wrong to stop people from getting married just because they're the same gender.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved, because it's not really a legal issue or something they should decide. It's more of a personal thing.  I don't want it to feel like we're putting gay people on display or making them feel like they made a mistake.\n\nSo I don't think the government should have anything to say about it. It's just not their place.\n\nIt's kind of complicated, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI guess I don't think the government should be involved because it doesn't affect national security or anything like that. It's not a moral issue. It's just about people's lives and who they love.\n\nIt just feels wrong to me to tell people they can't marry because of who they are. It's like how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "Okay, here's the thing about gay marriage.  There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some folks think that same-sex couples are a threat to families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're different but both are fruit.  It comes down to basic rights, like health care and property.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick. It's messed up if you're committed to someone and they can't be there for you when you need them. Studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not anything else.  \n\nWhat really bothers me is that people get hung up on the religious angle. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they just want a legal marriage certificate. Keep religion and government separate, right? It's like saying someone can't get married because their religion doesn't approve - that's not fair.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but there's no proof that kids raised by gay parents are any different.  It's about good parenting, not who the parents are. In some places, kids from gay families get bullied just for being different. That's wrong.\n\nWe need the government to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and treating everyone fairly. [",
            "Okay, so here's the thing about working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer.  Just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful.  I mean, I get it, making it freely available to everyone? Big no-no. But for medical reasons? Definitely yes.  I mean,  illegal doesn't equal no good, right?  \n\nThink about it, pharmacies use all sorts of controlled substances like Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet -  things that are totally illegal for regular folks. But doctors use them all the time because they can help people.  It's just that there's this crazy stigma around marijuana. We shouldn't judge something just because it's illegal. \n\nAlcohol is a good example, too.  It's legal but can be awful if you abuse it.  Marijuana can be abused too, but it's not as bad.  Maybe we should start slow with marijuana, make it legal gradually.  First, we need to ditch the bad image we have of it.  If we can get people to see it as something that can be used responsibly, then things might change. \n\nPeople think marijuana is super dangerous just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop thinking of it as this horrible drug, people might be more willing to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "So, yeah, I think the church has definitely changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be, you know? When I was a kid, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too. But now that I'm older, they have this teenager mass, and it's only thirty minutes long! People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see people coming straight from the beach in their swimsuits, families rushing in late, the whole deal. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed overall. \n\nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed about the changes. As for other stuff, I don't really know much about the inner workings of the church, but that's the church I know.\n\n\nRegarding all those accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests get married would have stopped it.  After all, there are married men who still become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not, it's about the person.  It's their choice to become a priest, and some religions allow priests to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  If they really want to marry and practice their faith, maybe they should consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia might be based on genetics,  something you're born with. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually, even if they try to hide it.  I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\nSo, you see, at first I was okay with the whole situation, but everyone was still pretty shaken up after 9/11. I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration, they linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We know now that none of that was true. It really bothers me that they led people astray like that.  Honestly, the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it yet.  Even Colin Powell, after his big speech at the UN, admitted he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then!  That's just wrong, plain and simple. To me, that's a serious offense. They don't seem to care about the Constitution at all, not since 9/11 anyway.  It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nI read in this book by a former Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – that the younger Bush was basically out for revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration. Plus, he probably wanted to control more of the world's energy supply.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nIt's been going on for far too long. Pulling out right now would be messy, though.  The country could easily fall into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nSo, the UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia involved to help fix things. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could lead to even more problems down the road because Iraq's sovereignty would become a huge issue.  The current government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.  The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, has a bunch of seats in Parliament now.  There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of trouble.\n\n(laughs)\n\nI could go on, but it's probably best not to say it all out loud.",
            "Mmm hmm. Let me just talk about my thoughts on the war in Iraq. Honestly, I feel like it’s kind of pointless. It wasn't even officially declared a war, you know? It feels like it was just a way for us to retaliate against Iraq because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks.  \n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're still there trying to establish a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. ally, and maybe also to secure their oil. But staying there just keeps causing more problems and making people upset. \n\nPlus, building a democracy takes a long time. It's not something you can just force overnight. If we leave suddenly, they'll be angry because they'll feel like we messed everything up and left them to deal with the mess. It's a real dilemma.\n\nHonestly, this topic is really hard for me. I don't know that much about it. I guess I feel torn. On one hand, I want the war to end because it's causing so much suffering. There are so many families with loved ones in Iraq, and I worry about them.  \n\nBut on the other hand, I don't want to leave Iraq in a worse state. It seems like our involvement has already caused a lot of chaos, and trying to force our way of life on them could make things even worse. I worry that it will just fuel more resentment and violence.\n\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really sad.",
            "Hmm... this whole issue about making it legal, it just feels wrong, you know? Like, it shouldn't be up to the government to decide. Our constitution, it clearly says separation of church and state.  It's written right there. Trying to force this on everyone, it feels like going against what's already been decided.  Plus, it seems like people pushing to make it illegal are just favoring one church's beliefs over others.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians aren't on board with it, except maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important, it's what makes religious freedom possible in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It would go against what's already in the constitution and would probably be the only amendment that restricts people instead of the government. \n\nHonestly, I don't think the federal government should have anything to do with this.  I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're trying to push their religion over everyone else's.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government.  There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't even impact the economy or anything like that.  It might even help society in some ways.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq... I don't really believe the government was completely honest with the people about why we went to war. They tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really related. The government used the fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one without a good reason.  This war feels a lot like Vietnam – we made the same mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The US just kicked out Iraq's government without a plan for what would happen next, which created chaos. \n\nThey wanted to put in a democracy, just like in Vietnam, but it's a really difficult and long process. It wasn't a clear victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss because there are always going to be people who resist, even if they want change. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there, and it's almost 2007, yet we're still losing soldiers. We're trying to train Iraqi troops, but it's taking forever. The US government didn't seem to understand how long and hard it takes to establish a new government. \n\nIt's complicated. We went in there, and now it's hard to just leave. We took away their government and way of life, so what do we do now? It's a tough choice. We risk more American lives for a democratic Iraq, but how many is too many? \n\nWhy are we focusing on Iraq and not other countries that need this kind of change? I think it might be about the oil.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. North Korea has those weapons, but we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not sure that will happen.",
            "Hmm...let me see... I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I truly believe it's a personal choice, you know? And studies show it's more about biology than anything else.  It's not fair to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong, you know? \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something between two people.  Like in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because the law won't let them. But they live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and doing normal things. \n\nIt's crazy how some people, like Bush, try to play God and decide what marriage means.  I think it's ridiculous. \n\nThere's tons of research showing that being gay is a biological thing, something you're born with. It's not a choice.\n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married they can just elope to Vegas and do it secretly. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a big public scandal. It shouldn't be a big deal, you know? It should be a private matter, not something the government gets involved in.",

What you post online can shape how people view you. If you're talking about violent things, someone might get worried. You can't just put anything out there.\n\nThe internet is huge, anyone can see it. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. So, if someone sees something concerning online, they might tell the school. They can't ignore it, because if something bad happens, they might have been able to stop it.\n\nIt's tricky though, because sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's serious. It could be a harmless experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. In one case, someone overheard something in school and told the school. They looked at the student's Facebook and found some posts that seemed harmless, but in light of the situation, they were worrisome.\n\nBasically, once you put something online, it's out there. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared it publicly. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger.",
            "This war feels like it's been going on forever.  In the beginning, I understood the goal – to bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove something to the world.  \n\nI even wonder if the reasons for starting the war were a bit shaky to begin with. There were those old issues between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein, and I can't help but think they played a part.\n\nIf the goal truly was to help people gain a fair political system, that would be a good reason for war. But if there were personal vendettas involved, then it wouldn't be right.\n\nAnyway, the war dragged on for way too long.  We made our point in the first few months, but now it just feels endless.\n\nI mean, if our goal was to free people from a tyrannical leader, that's a worthy cause. But over time, I think our reasons have gotten muddled. It feels like we're just stuck in a cycle of fighting, needing to declare victory, even if we've lost sight of what we're fighting for. \n\nThis war needs to end.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, money that could be used to help our own people. We have so many problems here at home – poverty, education, healthcare – that deserve our attention.\n\nIt's just not right to keep spending so much money on a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "Let me ask, though, isn't it kind of okay that someone found that information online?  Like, wasn't it good that someone saw it and was able to stop something bad from happening?\n\nI mean, it's tricky, right? You can't have someone watching every single student's profile all the time. It would be unfair to pick on certain kids and snoop on them just because they might be up to something.  \n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for specific things? \n\nIt's similar to how I feel about my own social media. I have Facebook, and it's scary to think about how much information is out there and how people can find it. I've heard stories about creeps who can easily get your information and even get you to meet up with them. It makes me nervous because they can learn a lot about you from your profile – your interests, your friends, even your schedule.\n\nI try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I also want to connect with my friends.\n\nIt's a tough balance. It's weird to think about schools banning Myspace, though. How can they really control what their students do online?  It feels like an invasion of privacy, even if they think they're trying to protect us.",
            "Hmm... Okay, so there's this thing about the Iraq War that I kinda feel weird talking about. I hate to sound like everyone else who's all, \"I knew it was a bad idea from the start!\"  But, honestly, it's just...  It feels like everyone agrees it was a mess except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong. You see it everywhere.  Poll after poll, people from the US, Iraq, even around the world, say it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think we should have never gone there. Even a lot of our own soldiers feel that way!\n\nIt's been a total disaster from the beginning.  And getting out is going to be another disaster. Honestly, it feels like anything we do in the Middle East just turns into a nightmare.\n\nIt's like we don't get it.  The US and the Middle East, we're just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. It's not how things work there.\n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about all the consequences is just reckless. It's like falling into quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some fancy reasons for staying, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually, maybe over a year, I wouldn't mind. But leaving now would be the best.\n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and some even want us to leave right now. Those are the people we're trying to help!  Maybe they know what's best for them. If we ask them and they say leave, at least we can say we tried to do what they wanted.\n\nMaybe then, if things go bad, we can step in and actually be the good guys.  I mean, we're never going to be totally loved in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Um, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  It's not just about women though. It seems to depend on what kind of work you do.  I mean, overall, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  Lots of guys struggle with the idea of working under a woman because of how society has always been. So, women often see jobs they're totally qualified for, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those top business roles.  And, it's kind of the same for men too. Like, in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's not really common to see a man doing those things. People often judge them for it, thinking a man should be working and making money for the family. It can be really hard on them, especially if it's always been their dream to stay home with the kids and help out, even if the wife has the better job.  It just works for them, but society doesn't get it.  And in fashion, sometimes people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because guys who are into fashion are often seen as having different lifestyles.  So if a guy has a typical lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might think, \"How can you really know about fashion if you're not a woman?\"  It's like they don't think he understands women's fashion.  \n\nSo, depending on the field, I definitely feel like there's gender discrimination in the US. Changing things is tough because society has these set ideas, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change is slow. I think we're making progress though. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are staying home with the kids and it's becoming more okay.  People are starting to see that it doesn't always have to be a certain way. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their female friends and wives and realizing that guys can know about fashion too. You kind of have to promote these different types of people by showing the good qualities without pushing too hard. If you force it, people resist. \n\nI think we're in a good place where things are starting to change naturally. I don't know if there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time.   \n\nOh, and by the way, it's not just about gender. People can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their education too. Like, if someone grew up on a farm and their grammar isn't perfect, but they're super smart and work their way up to a CEO position, other guys might look down on them and think they aren't serious because of their grammar. It's like, who knows what they're really saying if they can't speak properly. So yeah, there's discrimination based on a lot of things.",
            "So, basically, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the books as a criminal offense. You know, like a parking ticket instead of jail time.  My understanding is that if you get caught, it's still gonna mess with your job applications and stuff, even if it's not as bad as a full-blown arrest. The thing is, even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about those future consequences. But, on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest and process people for marijuana.  It costs a lot to keep them in jail, take them to court, and everything else.   So, for places that are struggling financially, it makes sense that they wouldn't want to decriminalize it, even if it would save them money. Some places just don't want to do it, even if they know it would be good for their budget. But, places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's totally fine. I bet they're using the money they saved to help people in need.  \n\nIt's important because we don't want weed everywhere, you know? There are other reasons why it shouldn't be super easy to get. But the money stuff is a big deal too.\n\nWhat if it got completely legal? Like cigarettes? Then everyone would be smoking it everywhere, and we'd have people driving high. And even now, it's still kind of taboo in a lot of places. It would just feel weird to have it so open.  \n\n\nI think alcohol messes with your motor skills worse, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. But they both have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it better than others. It's hard to say what's worse because it depends on the person.",
            "Hmmm...this whole Catholic thing, it's a mixed bag, you know?\n\nOn one hand, I get why people like them. They've got these strong traditions, things they've been doing for ages. Feels kinda comforting, like you've got roots. But hanging on too tight can be a problem too, gotta be able to bend with the times. \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know, they take it seriously, like going to church every week is a must. And the rules?  They're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like they think only *perfect* Catholics belong, and they're not so welcoming to folks who aren't exactly on the same page, or even from different religions.\n\nTake my parents, for example.  My mom was Catholic, my dad was Episcopalian, and the church wouldn't marry them!  Saying you love everyone but then not accepting them? Kinda hypocritical, right? It's like they preach love but then act closed off.\n\nThe church tells you to do good things, but sometimes their way of doing things just feels stuck in the past.  \n\nNow, some folks say letting priests marry would be a good idea, but honestly, I don't think it would stop the bad stuff. It's a separate issue, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they'll probably do it no matter what.  Being married doesn't change that.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage is really tough. I can't say one side is right or wrong, but it's definitely the hardest issue we're facing right now. It's like a balancing act between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.  It's super tricky, you know?  Like, should the government get involved in defining marriage at all? If it's a religious thing, shouldn't it be up to the churches?  Take baptism, for example, no one gets special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union, like two people coming together. The government shouldn't care what kind of marriage it is, just that two people are united.  And speaking of different types of marriage, this whole gay marriage thing... it's just two people wanting to be together, right?  If everyone can agree on a solution, shouldn't it become a national law?  But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's crazy! It feels like such a big deal to some people, but it doesn't seem like a good reason to change the constitution.",
            "Hmm...growing up in a Christian home, things like homosexuality are kinda confusing for me.  I've got plenty of gay friends, you see? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a big national debate, though.  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to legalize gay marriage. You know, like some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  If you live in a state that's okay with gay marriage, well,  that's just how it is there. You kinda chose to live there, right?  I think everyone deserves the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight. So, let each state make its own call. \n\nI already kinda said it, but it just feels wrong for someone like Bush, who doesn't live in every state, to ban gay marriage for the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide. I just don't think he should have that much power. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in who wants to lift the ban, it'll just be back and forth. It's better to let each state figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the decision.",
            "Okay, so let me get this straight. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? If you put something on there, anyone can see it, not just your friends.  Even if school officials aren't looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home. \n\nThink about it, if they're looking at Myspace to keep kids safe, like stopping a school shooting, that seems okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect students, right?  \n\nBut, if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy.  It's different when they're trying to prevent something bad from happening. \n\nIt's easier to express yourself in writing, so I guess I could say more about that. Since Myspace is public, if you post something and don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of silly. Everything you do online can come back to bite you later.\n\nLike, what you do in college could come back to haunt you when you're older. Once something is online, it's out there forever. \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy to look at Myspace if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen.  It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they want to know it's a safe place.\n\nMy teacher told me that schools have to do things like lock downs and drills to keep everyone safe. They want to be prepared for anything, like a school shooting.",
            "Okay, so, about this war...At first, I was all for it. Nine Eleven really hit me hard—it felt personal. I wanted to fight back, to dish out the same kind of trouble they caused us. Looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. It felt like we rushed into things without a real plan, and it just backfired. \n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It seems like those people are too busy fighting each other to bother with us. What's the point of us being there if they can't even get along? Honestly,  because of Nine Eleven, I don't really care what happens over there anymore. I just feel like they're all so different from us. They fight and fight, but they can't seem to solve anything on their own.\n\nWe went in unprepared. We didn't know what we were walking into, and war over there is unlike anything we've ever seen. They're just brutal, and I don't think they care about improving their country. They just want us out. I think that's fine with me—we should just leave.\n\nHonestly, I think we were all hyped up and angry, more than anything. We weren't thinking clearly about the consequences or how they'd react to us trying to change their whole way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge, and President Bush went along with it because the people wanted it.\n\nI get it, though. After Nine Eleven, we couldn't just ignore what happened. We had to do something. But maybe we could have done it differently.  We should have had a better plan, been clearer about our goals, and worked together better. There was no unity, no clear direction. \n\nI just think we went in with too much emotion and anger, and that's what we created there.  \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to change them. Maybe they'll always be like this. I don't know. I've said enough."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church needs to update some of its ideas.  \n\nA lot of people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very open-minded about things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but they seem a bit stuck in the past.\n\nIf they were more open to modern thinking, I think they wouldn't worry so much about losing people. I've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with its stance on these topics. They feel like the Church is wrong about these things.\n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a place where it's seen as completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage - if you support that, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the scandals we've seen. It's hard to say for sure if things would be different.\n\n\nIt just seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.",
            "Ehm...you know, I'm okay with gay marriage.  I don't think it's something you choose, like it's just how you are, ya know?  I don't think we should blame people for being gay. So, it feels wrong to say that a man and woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. It just doesn't seem fair.\n\nHonestly, I haven't thought about this too much, but I feel like it's wrong to say that. It's not like someone decides to be gay, right?  Just like I was born straight, someone else might be born gay.  It's not a choice.\n\n(clears throat) Yeah, I think it's wrong to stop people from getting married just because they're the same gender.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved, because it's not really a legal issue or something they should decide. It's more of a personal thing.  I don't want it to feel like we're putting gay people on display or making them feel like they made a mistake.\n\nSo I don't think the government should have anything to say about it. It's just not their place.\n\nIt's kind of complicated, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI guess I don't think the government should be involved because it doesn't affect national security or anything like that. It's not a moral issue. It's just about people's lives and who they love.\n\nIt just feels wrong to me to tell people they can't marry because of who they are. It's like how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "Okay, here's the thing about gay marriage.  There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some folks think that same-sex couples are a threat to families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're different but both are fruit.  It comes down to basic rights, like health care and property.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick. It's messed up if you're committed to someone and they can't be there for you when you need them. Studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not anything else.  \n\nWhat really bothers me is that people get hung up on the religious angle. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they just want a legal marriage certificate. Keep religion and government separate, right? It's like saying someone can't get married because their religion doesn't approve - that's not fair.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but there's no proof that kids raised by gay parents are any different.  It's about good parenting, not who the parents are. In some places, kids from gay families get bullied just for being different. That's wrong.\n\nWe need the government to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and treating everyone fairly. [",
            "Okay, so here's the thing about working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer.  Just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful.  I mean, I get it, making it freely available to everyone? Big no-no. But for medical reasons? Definitely yes.  I mean,  illegal doesn't equal no good, right?  \n\nThink about it, pharmacies use all sorts of controlled substances like Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet -  things that are totally illegal for regular folks. But doctors use them all the time because they can help people.  It's just that there's this crazy stigma around marijuana. We shouldn't judge something just because it's illegal. \n\nAlcohol is a good example, too.  It's legal but can be awful if you abuse it.  Marijuana can be abused too, but it's not as bad.  Maybe we should start slow with marijuana, make it legal gradually.  First, we need to ditch the bad image we have of it.  If we can get people to see it as something that can be used responsibly, then things might change. \n\nPeople think marijuana is super dangerous just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop thinking of it as this horrible drug, people might be more willing to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "So, yeah, I think the church has definitely changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be, you know? When I was a kid, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too. But now that I'm older, they have this teenager mass, and it's only thirty minutes long! People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see people coming straight from the beach in their swimsuits, families rushing in late, the whole deal. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed overall. \n\nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed about the changes. As for other stuff, I don't really know much about the inner workings of the church, but that's the church I know.\n\n\nRegarding all those accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests get married would have stopped it.  After all, there are married men who still become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not, it's about the person.  It's their choice to become a priest, and some religions allow priests to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  If they really want to marry and practice their faith, maybe they should consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia might be based on genetics,  something you're born with. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually, even if they try to hide it.  I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\nSo, you see, at first I was okay with the whole situation, but everyone was still pretty shaken up after 9/11. I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration, they linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We know now that none of that was true. It really bothers me that they led people astray like that.  Honestly, the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it yet.  Even Colin Powell, after his big speech at the UN, admitted he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then!  That's just wrong, plain and simple. To me, that's a serious offense. They don't seem to care about the Constitution at all, not since 9/11 anyway.  It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nI read in this book by a former Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – that the younger Bush was basically out for revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration. Plus, he probably wanted to control more of the world's energy supply.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nIt's been going on for far too long. Pulling out right now would be messy, though.  The country could easily fall into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nSo, the UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia involved to help fix things. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could lead to even more problems down the road because Iraq's sovereignty would become a huge issue.  The current government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.  The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, has a bunch of seats in Parliament now.  There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of trouble.\n\n(laughs)\n\nI could go on, but it's probably best not to say it all out loud.",
            "Mmm hmm. Let me just talk about my thoughts on the war in Iraq. Honestly, I feel like it’s kind of pointless. It wasn't even officially declared a war, you know? It feels like it was just a way for us to retaliate against Iraq because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks.  \n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're still there trying to establish a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. ally, and maybe also to secure their oil. But staying there just keeps causing more problems and making people upset. \n\nPlus, building a democracy takes a long time. It's not something you can just force overnight. If we leave suddenly, they'll be angry because they'll feel like we messed everything up and left them to deal with the mess. It's a real dilemma.\n\nHonestly, this topic is really hard for me. I don't know that much about it. I guess I feel torn. On one hand, I want the war to end because it's causing so much suffering. There are so many families with loved ones in Iraq, and I worry about them.  \n\nBut on the other hand, I don't want to leave Iraq in a worse state. It seems like our involvement has already caused a lot of chaos, and trying to force our way of life on them could make things even worse. I worry that it will just fuel more resentment and violence.\n\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really sad.",
            "Hmm... this whole issue about making it legal, it just feels wrong, you know? Like, it shouldn't be up to the government to decide. Our constitution, it clearly says separation of church and state.  It's written right there. Trying to force this on everyone, it feels like going against what's already been decided.  Plus, it seems like people pushing to make it illegal are just favoring one church's beliefs over others.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians aren't on board with it, except maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important, it's what makes religious freedom possible in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It would go against what's already in the constitution and would probably be the only amendment that restricts people instead of the government. \n\nHonestly, I don't think the federal government should have anything to do with this.  I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're trying to push their religion over everyone else's.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government.  There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't even impact the economy or anything like that.  It might even help society in some ways.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq... I don't really believe the government was completely honest with the people about why we went to war. They tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really related. The government used the fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one without a good reason.  This war feels a lot like Vietnam – we made the same mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The US just kicked out Iraq's government without a plan for what would happen next, which created chaos. \n\nThey wanted to put in a democracy, just like in Vietnam, but it's a really difficult and long process. It wasn't a clear victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss because there are always going to be people who resist, even if they want change. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there, and it's almost 2007, yet we're still losing soldiers. We're trying to train Iraqi troops, but it's taking forever. The US government didn't seem to understand how long and hard it takes to establish a new government. \n\nIt's complicated. We went in there, and now it's hard to just leave. We took away their government and way of life, so what do we do now? It's a tough choice. We risk more American lives for a democratic Iraq, but how many is too many? \n\nWhy are we focusing on Iraq and not other countries that need this kind of change? I think it might be about the oil.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. North Korea has those weapons, but we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not sure that will happen.",
            "Hmm...let me see... I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I truly believe it's a personal choice, you know? And studies show it's more about biology than anything else.  It's not fair to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong, you know? \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something between two people.  Like in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because the law won't let them. But they live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and doing normal things. \n\nIt's crazy how some people, like Bush, try to play God and decide what marriage means.  I think it's ridiculous. \n\nThere's tons of research showing that being gay is a biological thing, something you're born with. It's not a choice.\n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married they can just elope to Vegas and do it secretly. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a big public scandal. It shouldn't be a big deal, you know? It should be a private matter, not something the government gets involved in.",

What you post online can shape how people view you. If you're talking about violent things, someone might get worried. You can't just put anything out there.\n\nThe internet is huge, anyone can see it. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. So, if someone sees something concerning online, they might tell the school. They can't ignore it, because if something bad happens, they might have been able to stop it.\n\nIt's tricky though, because sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's serious. It could be a harmless experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. In one case, someone overheard something in school and told the school. They looked at the student's Facebook and found some posts that seemed harmless, but in light of the situation, they were worrisome.\n\nBasically, once you put something online, it's out there. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared it publicly. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger.",
            "This war feels like it's been going on forever.  In the beginning, I understood the goal – to bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove something to the world.  \n\nI even wonder if the reasons for starting the war were a bit shaky to begin with. There were those old issues between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein, and I can't help but think they played a part.\n\nIf the goal truly was to help people gain a fair political system, that would be a good reason for war. But if there were personal vendettas involved, then it wouldn't be right.\n\nAnyway, the war dragged on for way too long.  We made our point in the first few months, but now it just feels endless.\n\nI mean, if our goal was to free people from a tyrannical leader, that's a worthy cause. But over time, I think our reasons have gotten muddled. It feels like we're just stuck in a cycle of fighting, needing to declare victory, even if we've lost sight of what we're fighting for. \n\nThis war needs to end.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, money that could be used to help our own people. We have so many problems here at home – poverty, education, healthcare – that deserve our attention.\n\nIt's just not right to keep spending so much money on a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "Let me ask, though, isn't it kind of okay that someone found that information online?  Like, wasn't it good that someone saw it and was able to stop something bad from happening?\n\nI mean, it's tricky, right? You can't have someone watching every single student's profile all the time. It would be unfair to pick on certain kids and snoop on them just because they might be up to something.  \n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for specific things? \n\nIt's similar to how I feel about my own social media. I have Facebook, and it's scary to think about how much information is out there and how people can find it. I've heard stories about creeps who can easily get your information and even get you to meet up with them. It makes me nervous because they can learn a lot about you from your profile – your interests, your friends, even your schedule.\n\nI try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I also want to connect with my friends.\n\nIt's a tough balance. It's weird to think about schools banning Myspace, though. How can they really control what their students do online?  It feels like an invasion of privacy, even if they think they're trying to protect us.",
            "Hmm... Okay, so there's this thing about the Iraq War that I kinda feel weird talking about. I hate to sound like everyone else who's all, \"I knew it was a bad idea from the start!\"  But, honestly, it's just...  It feels like everyone agrees it was a mess except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong. You see it everywhere.  Poll after poll, people from the US, Iraq, even around the world, say it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think we should have never gone there. Even a lot of our own soldiers feel that way!\n\nIt's been a total disaster from the beginning.  And getting out is going to be another disaster. Honestly, it feels like anything we do in the Middle East just turns into a nightmare.\n\nIt's like we don't get it.  The US and the Middle East, we're just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. It's not how things work there.\n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about all the consequences is just reckless. It's like falling into quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some fancy reasons for staying, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually, maybe over a year, I wouldn't mind. But leaving now would be the best.\n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and some even want us to leave right now. Those are the people we're trying to help!  Maybe they know what's best for them. If we ask them and they say leave, at least we can say we tried to do what they wanted.\n\nMaybe then, if things go bad, we can step in and actually be the good guys.  I mean, we're never going to be totally loved in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Um, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  It's not just about women though. It seems to depend on what kind of work you do.  I mean, overall, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  Lots of guys struggle with the idea of working under a woman because of how society has always been. So, women often see jobs they're totally qualified for, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those top business roles.  And, it's kind of the same for men too. Like, in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's not really common to see a man doing those things. People often judge them for it, thinking a man should be working and making money for the family. It can be really hard on them, especially if it's always been their dream to stay home with the kids and help out, even if the wife has the better job.  It just works for them, but society doesn't get it.  And in fashion, sometimes people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because guys who are into fashion are often seen as having different lifestyles.  So if a guy has a typical lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might think, \"How can you really know about fashion if you're not a woman?\"  It's like they don't think he understands women's fashion.  \n\nSo, depending on the field, I definitely feel like there's gender discrimination in the US. Changing things is tough because society has these set ideas, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change is slow. I think we're making progress though. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are staying home with the kids and it's becoming more okay.  People are starting to see that it doesn't always have to be a certain way. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their female friends and wives and realizing that guys can know about fashion too. You kind of have to promote these different types of people by showing the good qualities without pushing too hard. If you force it, people resist. \n\nI think we're in a good place where things are starting to change naturally. I don't know if there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time.   \n\nOh, and by the way, it's not just about gender. People can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their education too. Like, if someone grew up on a farm and their grammar isn't perfect, but they're super smart and work their way up to a CEO position, other guys might look down on them and think they aren't serious because of their grammar. It's like, who knows what they're really saying if they can't speak properly. So yeah, there's discrimination based on a lot of things.",
            "So, basically, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the books as a criminal offense. You know, like a parking ticket instead of jail time.  My understanding is that if you get caught, it's still gonna mess with your job applications and stuff, even if it's not as bad as a full-blown arrest. The thing is, even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about those future consequences. But, on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest and process people for marijuana.  It costs a lot to keep them in jail, take them to court, and everything else.   So, for places that are struggling financially, it makes sense that they wouldn't want to decriminalize it, even if it would save them money. Some places just don't want to do it, even if they know it would be good for their budget. But, places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's totally fine. I bet they're using the money they saved to help people in need.  \n\nIt's important because we don't want weed everywhere, you know? There are other reasons why it shouldn't be super easy to get. But the money stuff is a big deal too.\n\nWhat if it got completely legal? Like cigarettes? Then everyone would be smoking it everywhere, and we'd have people driving high. And even now, it's still kind of taboo in a lot of places. It would just feel weird to have it so open.  \n\n\nI think alcohol messes with your motor skills worse, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. But they both have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it better than others. It's hard to say what's worse because it depends on the person.",
            "Hmmm...this whole Catholic thing, it's a mixed bag, you know?\n\nOn one hand, I get why people like them. They've got these strong traditions, things they've been doing for ages. Feels kinda comforting, like you've got roots. But hanging on too tight can be a problem too, gotta be able to bend with the times. \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know, they take it seriously, like going to church every week is a must. And the rules?  They're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like they think only *perfect* Catholics belong, and they're not so welcoming to folks who aren't exactly on the same page, or even from different religions.\n\nTake my parents, for example.  My mom was Catholic, my dad was Episcopalian, and the church wouldn't marry them!  Saying you love everyone but then not accepting them? Kinda hypocritical, right? It's like they preach love but then act closed off.\n\nThe church tells you to do good things, but sometimes their way of doing things just feels stuck in the past.  \n\nNow, some folks say letting priests marry would be a good idea, but honestly, I don't think it would stop the bad stuff. It's a separate issue, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they'll probably do it no matter what.  Being married doesn't change that.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage is really tough. I can't say one side is right or wrong, but it's definitely the hardest issue we're facing right now. It's like a balancing act between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.  It's super tricky, you know?  Like, should the government get involved in defining marriage at all? If it's a religious thing, shouldn't it be up to the churches?  Take baptism, for example, no one gets special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union, like two people coming together. The government shouldn't care what kind of marriage it is, just that two people are united.  And speaking of different types of marriage, this whole gay marriage thing... it's just two people wanting to be together, right?  If everyone can agree on a solution, shouldn't it become a national law?  But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's crazy! It feels like such a big deal to some people, but it doesn't seem like a good reason to change the constitution.",
            "Hmm...growing up in a Christian home, things like homosexuality are kinda confusing for me.  I've got plenty of gay friends, you see? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a big national debate, though.  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to legalize gay marriage. You know, like some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  If you live in a state that's okay with gay marriage, well,  that's just how it is there. You kinda chose to live there, right?  I think everyone deserves the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight. So, let each state make its own call. \n\nI already kinda said it, but it just feels wrong for someone like Bush, who doesn't live in every state, to ban gay marriage for the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide. I just don't think he should have that much power. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in who wants to lift the ban, it'll just be back and forth. It's better to let each state figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the decision.",
            "Okay, so let me get this straight. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? If you put something on there, anyone can see it, not just your friends.  Even if school officials aren't looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home. \n\nThink about it, if they're looking at Myspace to keep kids safe, like stopping a school shooting, that seems okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect students, right?  \n\nBut, if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy.  It's different when they're trying to prevent something bad from happening. \n\nIt's easier to express yourself in writing, so I guess I could say more about that. Since Myspace is public, if you post something and don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of silly. Everything you do online can come back to bite you later.\n\nLike, what you do in college could come back to haunt you when you're older. Once something is online, it's out there forever. \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy to look at Myspace if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen.  It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they want to know it's a safe place.\n\nMy teacher told me that schools have to do things like lock downs and drills to keep everyone safe. They want to be prepared for anything, like a school shooting.",
            "Okay, so, about this war...At first, I was all for it. Nine Eleven really hit me hard—it felt personal. I wanted to fight back, to dish out the same kind of trouble they caused us. Looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. It felt like we rushed into things without a real plan, and it just backfired. \n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It seems like those people are too busy fighting each other to bother with us. What's the point of us being there if they can't even get along? Honestly,  because of Nine Eleven, I don't really care what happens over there anymore. I just feel like they're all so different from us. They fight and fight, but they can't seem to solve anything on their own.\n\nWe went in unprepared. We didn't know what we were walking into, and war over there is unlike anything we've ever seen. They're just brutal, and I don't think they care about improving their country. They just want us out. I think that's fine with me—we should just leave.\n\nHonestly, I think we were all hyped up and angry, more than anything. We weren't thinking clearly about the consequences or how they'd react to us trying to change their whole way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge, and President Bush went along with it because the people wanted it.\n\nI get it, though. After Nine Eleven, we couldn't just ignore what happened. We had to do something. But maybe we could have done it differently.  We should have had a better plan, been clearer about our goals, and worked together better. There was no unity, no clear direction. \n\nI just think we went in with too much emotion and anger, and that's what we created there.  \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to change them. Maybe they'll always be like this. I don't know. I've said enough."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church needs to update some of its ideas.  \n\nA lot of people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very open-minded about things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong beliefs on these issues, which is fine, but they seem a bit stuck in the past.\n\nIf they were more open to modern thinking, I think they wouldn't worry so much about losing people. I've heard that some folks are turning away from the Church because they disagree with its stance on these topics. They feel like the Church is wrong about these things.\n\nFor example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a place where it's seen as completely wrong.  Same goes for gay marriage - if you support that, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't.\n\nI don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the scandals we've seen. It's hard to say for sure if things would be different.\n\n\nIt just seems unfair that priests are expected to be completely devoted to God while everyone else gets to have a family and other relationships.",
            "Ehm...you know, I'm okay with gay marriage.  I don't think it's something you choose, like it's just how you are, ya know?  I don't think we should blame people for being gay. So, it feels wrong to say that a man and woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can't. It just doesn't seem fair.\n\nHonestly, I haven't thought about this too much, but I feel like it's wrong to say that. It's not like someone decides to be gay, right?  Just like I was born straight, someone else might be born gay.  It's not a choice.\n\n(clears throat) Yeah, I think it's wrong to stop people from getting married just because they're the same gender.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved, because it's not really a legal issue or something they should decide. It's more of a personal thing.  I don't want it to feel like we're putting gay people on display or making them feel like they made a mistake.\n\nSo I don't think the government should have anything to say about it. It's just not their place.\n\nIt's kind of complicated, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI guess I don't think the government should be involved because it doesn't affect national security or anything like that. It's not a moral issue. It's just about people's lives and who they love.\n\nIt just feels wrong to me to tell people they can't marry because of who they are. It's like how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "Okay, here's the thing about gay marriage.  There's really no good reason not to allow it.  Some folks think that same-sex couples are a threat to families, but that's just not true. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're different but both are fruit.  It comes down to basic rights, like health care and property.  If you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be able to be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions if you're sick. It's messed up if you're committed to someone and they can't be there for you when you need them. Studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not anything else.  \n\nWhat really bothers me is that people get hung up on the religious angle. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they just want a legal marriage certificate. Keep religion and government separate, right? It's like saying someone can't get married because their religion doesn't approve - that's not fair.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but there's no proof that kids raised by gay parents are any different.  It's about good parenting, not who the parents are. In some places, kids from gay families get bullied just for being different. That's wrong.\n\nWe need the government to step up and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and treating everyone fairly. [",
            "Okay, so here's the thing about working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer.  Just because something's illegal doesn't mean it can't be helpful.  I mean, I get it, making it freely available to everyone? Big no-no. But for medical reasons? Definitely yes.  I mean,  illegal doesn't equal no good, right?  \n\nThink about it, pharmacies use all sorts of controlled substances like Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet -  things that are totally illegal for regular folks. But doctors use them all the time because they can help people.  It's just that there's this crazy stigma around marijuana. We shouldn't judge something just because it's illegal. \n\nAlcohol is a good example, too.  It's legal but can be awful if you abuse it.  Marijuana can be abused too, but it's not as bad.  Maybe we should start slow with marijuana, make it legal gradually.  First, we need to ditch the bad image we have of it.  If we can get people to see it as something that can be used responsibly, then things might change. \n\nPeople think marijuana is super dangerous just because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop thinking of it as this horrible drug, people might be more willing to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "So, yeah, I think the church has definitely changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be, you know? When I was a kid, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in cute dresses and matching shoes and purses, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on Sundays too. But now that I'm older, they have this teenager mass, and it's only thirty minutes long! People dress way more casually now, especially in the summer. You see people coming straight from the beach in their swimsuits, families rushing in late, the whole deal. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. It's a lot more relaxed overall. \n\nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed about the changes. As for other stuff, I don't really know much about the inner workings of the church, but that's the church I know.\n\n\nRegarding all those accusations against Catholic priests about pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or letting priests get married would have stopped it.  After all, there are married men who still become pedophiles. It's not about being married or not, it's about the person.  It's their choice to become a priest, and some religions allow priests to be married, like in that show \"Seventh Heaven.\"  If they really want to marry and practice their faith, maybe they should consider a different religion.\n\nI think pedophilia might be based on genetics,  something you're born with. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually, even if they try to hide it.  I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, shame on them. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\nSo, you see, at first I was okay with the whole situation, but everyone was still pretty shaken up after 9/11. I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration, they linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We know now that none of that was true. It really bothers me that they led people astray like that.  Honestly, the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\n\nIt feels like the Bush administration straight-up lied to the American people and they haven't even admitted it yet.  Even Colin Powell, after his big speech at the UN, admitted he wasn't really convinced by the evidence back then!  That's just wrong, plain and simple. To me, that's a serious offense. They don't seem to care about the Constitution at all, not since 9/11 anyway.  It seems like they came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nI read in this book by a former Treasury Secretary – I can't remember his name – that the younger Bush was basically out for revenge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration. Plus, he probably wanted to control more of the world's energy supply.  That's a pretty sneaky way to do things.\n\nIt's been going on for far too long. Pulling out right now would be messy, though.  The country could easily fall into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nSo, the UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia involved to help fix things. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either.  It could lead to even more problems down the road because Iraq's sovereignty would become a huge issue.  The current government is falling apart, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.  The Prime Minister doesn't really have any power, and even that guy, Mugtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, has a bunch of seats in Parliament now.  There are a lot of different groups fighting for control, and it's causing a lot of trouble.\n\n(laughs)\n\nI could go on, but it's probably best not to say it all out loud.",
            "Mmm hmm. Let me just talk about my thoughts on the war in Iraq. Honestly, I feel like it’s kind of pointless. It wasn't even officially declared a war, you know? It feels like it was just a way for us to retaliate against Iraq because they were suspected of being behind the 9/11 attacks.  \n\nI'm not really into following all the details of the war, but it seems like we're still there trying to establish a democracy, kind of like making Iraq another U.S. ally, and maybe also to secure their oil. But staying there just keeps causing more problems and making people upset. \n\nPlus, building a democracy takes a long time. It's not something you can just force overnight. If we leave suddenly, they'll be angry because they'll feel like we messed everything up and left them to deal with the mess. It's a real dilemma.\n\nHonestly, this topic is really hard for me. I don't know that much about it. I guess I feel torn. On one hand, I want the war to end because it's causing so much suffering. There are so many families with loved ones in Iraq, and I worry about them.  \n\nBut on the other hand, I don't want to leave Iraq in a worse state. It seems like our involvement has already caused a lot of chaos, and trying to force our way of life on them could make things even worse. I worry that it will just fuel more resentment and violence.\n\n\nI think this whole situation is going to drag on for a long time, and it's really sad.",
            "Hmm... this whole issue about making it legal, it just feels wrong, you know? Like, it shouldn't be up to the government to decide. Our constitution, it clearly says separation of church and state.  It's written right there. Trying to force this on everyone, it feels like going against what's already been decided.  Plus, it seems like people pushing to make it illegal are just favoring one church's beliefs over others.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians aren't on board with it, except maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to tell churches what they can and can't do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is super important, it's what makes religious freedom possible in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It would go against what's already in the constitution and would probably be the only amendment that restricts people instead of the government. \n\nHonestly, I don't think the federal government should have anything to do with this.  I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're trying to push their religion over everyone else's.  It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone else in government.  There's no good reason for an amendment banning it, it wouldn't even impact the economy or anything like that.  It might even help society in some ways.",
            "Okay, so, about the war in Iraq... I don't really believe the government was completely honest with the people about why we went to war. They tried to connect it to the 9/11 attacks, even though those two things weren't really related. The government used the fear and anger from 9/11 to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially starting one without a good reason.  This war feels a lot like Vietnam – we made the same mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking. The US just kicked out Iraq's government without a plan for what would happen next, which created chaos. \n\nThey wanted to put in a democracy, just like in Vietnam, but it's a really difficult and long process. It wasn't a clear victory like they made it seem. It's more like a loss because there are always going to be people who resist, even if they want change. \n\nI think the government wasn't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government.  We're still there, and it's almost 2007, yet we're still losing soldiers. We're trying to train Iraqi troops, but it's taking forever. The US government didn't seem to understand how long and hard it takes to establish a new government. \n\nIt's complicated. We went in there, and now it's hard to just leave. We took away their government and way of life, so what do we do now? It's a tough choice. We risk more American lives for a democratic Iraq, but how many is too many? \n\nWhy are we focusing on Iraq and not other countries that need this kind of change? I think it might be about the oil.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but we never found any. North Korea has those weapons, but we're not doing anything about it.  I don't think the US government is being truthful about its reasons for going to war.\n\nI just hope it ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but I'm not sure that will happen.",
            "Hmm...let me see... I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I truly believe it's a personal choice, you know? And studies show it's more about biology than anything else.  It's not fair to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control. It feels wrong, you know? \n\nI've always been a supporter of gay marriage. Politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's a personal matter, something between two people.  Like in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who aren't married because the law won't let them. But they live their lives just like any other family, walking their dogs and doing normal things. \n\nIt's crazy how some people, like Bush, try to play God and decide what marriage means.  I think it's ridiculous. \n\nThere's tons of research showing that being gay is a biological thing, something you're born with. It's not a choice.\n\nThe thing is, if a guy and a girl want to get married they can just elope to Vegas and do it secretly. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a big public scandal. It shouldn't be a big deal, you know? It should be a private matter, not something the government gets involved in.",

What you post online can shape how people view you. If you're talking about violent things, someone might get worried. You can't just put anything out there.\n\nThe internet is huge, anyone can see it. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their updates. So, if someone sees something concerning online, they might tell the school. They can't ignore it, because if something bad happens, they might have been able to stop it.\n\nIt's tricky though, because sometimes people joke around online, and it's hard to know what's serious. It could be a harmless experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. In one case, someone overheard something in school and told the school. They looked at the student's Facebook and found some posts that seemed harmless, but in light of the situation, they were worrisome.\n\nBasically, once you put something online, it's out there. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy because the person shared it publicly. They have to take it seriously if there's a potential danger.",
            "This war feels like it's been going on forever.  In the beginning, I understood the goal – to bring democracy to a country that needed it. But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, trying to prove something to the world.  \n\nI even wonder if the reasons for starting the war were a bit shaky to begin with. There were those old issues between George Bush's dad and Saddam Hussein, and I can't help but think they played a part.\n\nIf the goal truly was to help people gain a fair political system, that would be a good reason for war. But if there were personal vendettas involved, then it wouldn't be right.\n\nAnyway, the war dragged on for way too long.  We made our point in the first few months, but now it just feels endless.\n\nI mean, if our goal was to free people from a tyrannical leader, that's a worthy cause. But over time, I think our reasons have gotten muddled. It feels like we're just stuck in a cycle of fighting, needing to declare victory, even if we've lost sight of what we're fighting for. \n\nThis war needs to end.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, money that could be used to help our own people. We have so many problems here at home – poverty, education, healthcare – that deserve our attention.\n\nIt's just not right to keep spending so much money on a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "Let me ask, though, isn't it kind of okay that someone found that information online?  Like, wasn't it good that someone saw it and was able to stop something bad from happening?\n\nI mean, it's tricky, right? You can't have someone watching every single student's profile all the time. It would be unfair to pick on certain kids and snoop on them just because they might be up to something.  \n\nBut, I guess it depends on the situation. Was someone just randomly looking, or were they looking for specific things? \n\nIt's similar to how I feel about my own social media. I have Facebook, and it's scary to think about how much information is out there and how people can find it. I've heard stories about creeps who can easily get your information and even get you to meet up with them. It makes me nervous because they can learn a lot about you from your profile – your interests, your friends, even your schedule.\n\nI try to be careful about what I share, but it's hard because I also want to connect with my friends.\n\nIt's a tough balance. It's weird to think about schools banning Myspace, though. How can they really control what their students do online?  It feels like an invasion of privacy, even if they think they're trying to protect us.",
            "Hmm... Okay, so there's this thing about the Iraq War that I kinda feel weird talking about. I hate to sound like everyone else who's all, \"I knew it was a bad idea from the start!\"  But, honestly, it's just...  It feels like everyone agrees it was a mess except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong. You see it everywhere.  Poll after poll, people from the US, Iraq, even around the world, say it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think we should have never gone there. Even a lot of our own soldiers feel that way!\n\nIt's been a total disaster from the beginning.  And getting out is going to be another disaster. Honestly, it feels like anything we do in the Middle East just turns into a nightmare.\n\nIt's like we don't get it.  The US and the Middle East, we're just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that isn't ready for it. It's not how things work there.\n\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but invading a country without thinking about all the consequences is just reckless. It's like falling into quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure the government has some fancy reasons for staying, but I haven't heard anything convincing.\n\nIf they want to leave gradually, maybe over a year, I wouldn't mind. But leaving now would be the best.\n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and some even want us to leave right now. Those are the people we're trying to help!  Maybe they know what's best for them. If we ask them and they say leave, at least we can say we tried to do what they wanted.\n\nMaybe then, if things go bad, we can step in and actually be the good guys.  I mean, we're never going to be totally loved in the Middle East, but at least it would be better than where we are now.",
            "Um, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the US.  It's not just about women though. It seems to depend on what kind of work you do.  I mean, overall, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  Lots of guys struggle with the idea of working under a woman because of how society has always been. So, women often see jobs they're totally qualified for, but the board might not choose them because historically, women haven't been in those top business roles.  And, it's kind of the same for men too. Like, in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's not really common to see a man doing those things. People often judge them for it, thinking a man should be working and making money for the family. It can be really hard on them, especially if it's always been their dream to stay home with the kids and help out, even if the wife has the better job.  It just works for them, but society doesn't get it.  And in fashion, sometimes people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because guys who are into fashion are often seen as having different lifestyles.  So if a guy has a typical lifestyle and he's in fashion, people might think, \"How can you really know about fashion if you're not a woman?\"  It's like they don't think he understands women's fashion.  \n\nSo, depending on the field, I definitely feel like there's gender discrimination in the US. Changing things is tough because society has these set ideas, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change is slow. I think we're making progress though. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are staying home with the kids and it's becoming more okay.  People are starting to see that it doesn't always have to be a certain way. And in fashion, maybe people are listening to their female friends and wives and realizing that guys can know about fashion too. You kind of have to promote these different types of people by showing the good qualities without pushing too hard. If you force it, people resist. \n\nI think we're in a good place where things are starting to change naturally. I don't know if there's anything else we can do right now besides what's already being done. Change takes time.   \n\nOh, and by the way, it's not just about gender. People can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their education too. Like, if someone grew up on a farm and their grammar isn't perfect, but they're super smart and work their way up to a CEO position, other guys might look down on them and think they aren't serious because of their grammar. It's like, who knows what they're really saying if they can't speak properly. So yeah, there's discrimination based on a lot of things.",
            "So, basically, they didn't actually make it legal, they just took it off the books as a criminal offense. You know, like a parking ticket instead of jail time.  My understanding is that if you get caught, it's still gonna mess with your job applications and stuff, even if it's not as bad as a full-blown arrest. The thing is, even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about those future consequences. But, on the other hand, it costs a lot of money to arrest and process people for marijuana.  It costs a lot to keep them in jail, take them to court, and everything else.   So, for places that are struggling financially, it makes sense that they wouldn't want to decriminalize it, even if it would save them money. Some places just don't want to do it, even if they know it would be good for their budget. But, places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, I think it's totally fine. I bet they're using the money they saved to help people in need.  \n\nIt's important because we don't want weed everywhere, you know? There are other reasons why it shouldn't be super easy to get. But the money stuff is a big deal too.\n\nWhat if it got completely legal? Like cigarettes? Then everyone would be smoking it everywhere, and we'd have people driving high. And even now, it's still kind of taboo in a lot of places. It would just feel weird to have it so open.  \n\n\nI think alcohol messes with your motor skills worse, but marijuana can really mess with your life in other ways. But they both have bad effects, and everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it better than others. It's hard to say what's worse because it depends on the person.",
            "Hmmm...this whole Catholic thing, it's a mixed bag, you know?\n\nOn one hand, I get why people like them. They've got these strong traditions, things they've been doing for ages. Feels kinda comforting, like you've got roots. But hanging on too tight can be a problem too, gotta be able to bend with the times. \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know, they take it seriously, like going to church every week is a must. And the rules?  They're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like they think only *perfect* Catholics belong, and they're not so welcoming to folks who aren't exactly on the same page, or even from different religions.\n\nTake my parents, for example.  My mom was Catholic, my dad was Episcopalian, and the church wouldn't marry them!  Saying you love everyone but then not accepting them? Kinda hypocritical, right? It's like they preach love but then act closed off.\n\nThe church tells you to do good things, but sometimes their way of doing things just feels stuck in the past.  \n\nNow, some folks say letting priests marry would be a good idea, but honestly, I don't think it would stop the bad stuff. It's a separate issue, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they'll probably do it no matter what.  Being married doesn't change that.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about marriage is really tough. I can't say one side is right or wrong, but it's definitely the hardest issue we're facing right now. It's like a balancing act between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means.  It's super tricky, you know?  Like, should the government get involved in defining marriage at all? If it's a religious thing, shouldn't it be up to the churches?  Take baptism, for example, no one gets special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. So maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union, like two people coming together. The government shouldn't care what kind of marriage it is, just that two people are united.  And speaking of different types of marriage, this whole gay marriage thing... it's just two people wanting to be together, right?  If everyone can agree on a solution, shouldn't it become a national law?  But trying to ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's crazy! It feels like such a big deal to some people, but it doesn't seem like a good reason to change the constitution.",
            "Hmm...growing up in a Christian home, things like homosexuality are kinda confusing for me.  I've got plenty of gay friends, you see? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to do their own thing.  It shouldn't be a big national debate, though.  I feel like each state should decide for themselves whether or not to legalize gay marriage. You know, like some states are more liberal, some are more conservative.  If you live in a state that's okay with gay marriage, well,  that's just how it is there. You kinda chose to live there, right?  I think everyone deserves the same opportunities, whether they're gay or straight. So, let each state make its own call. \n\nI already kinda said it, but it just feels wrong for someone like Bush, who doesn't live in every state, to ban gay marriage for the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide. I just don't think he should have that much power. Plus, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in who wants to lift the ban, it'll just be back and forth. It's better to let each state figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the decision.",
            "Okay, so let me get this straight. Myspace is like a public bulletin board, right? If you put something on there, anyone can see it, not just your friends.  Even if school officials aren't looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home. \n\nThink about it, if they're looking at Myspace to keep kids safe, like stopping a school shooting, that seems okay.  Schools have a responsibility to protect students, right?  \n\nBut, if they're just snooping around to catch kids doing stuff they shouldn't, like drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy.  It's different when they're trying to prevent something bad from happening. \n\nIt's easier to express yourself in writing, so I guess I could say more about that. Since Myspace is public, if you post something and don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of silly. Everything you do online can come back to bite you later.\n\nLike, what you do in college could come back to haunt you when you're older. Once something is online, it's out there forever. \n\nI don't think it's an invasion of privacy to look at Myspace if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen.  It's like when parents drop their kids off at school, they want to know it's a safe place.\n\nMy teacher told me that schools have to do things like lock downs and drills to keep everyone safe. They want to be prepared for anything, like a school shooting.",
            "Okay, so, about this war...At first, I was all for it. Nine Eleven really hit me hard—it felt personal. I wanted to fight back, to dish out the same kind of trouble they caused us. Looking back, I think we were too caught up in the emotions. It felt like we rushed into things without a real plan, and it just backfired. \n\nNow, I'm totally against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. It seems like those people are too busy fighting each other to bother with us. What's the point of us being there if they can't even get along? Honestly,  because of Nine Eleven, I don't really care what happens over there anymore. I just feel like they're all so different from us. They fight and fight, but they can't seem to solve anything on their own.\n\nWe went in unprepared. We didn't know what we were walking into, and war over there is unlike anything we've ever seen. They're just brutal, and I don't think they care about improving their country. They just want us out. I think that's fine with me—we should just leave.\n\nHonestly, I think we were all hyped up and angry, more than anything. We weren't thinking clearly about the consequences or how they'd react to us trying to change their whole way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge, and President Bush went along with it because the people wanted it.\n\nI get it, though. After Nine Eleven, we couldn't just ignore what happened. We had to do something. But maybe we could have done it differently.  We should have had a better plan, been clearer about our goals, and worked together better. There was no unity, no clear direction. \n\nI just think we went in with too much emotion and anger, and that's what we created there.  \n\nMaybe we're not the ones to change them. Maybe they'll always be like this. I don't know. I've said enough."
