            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "So, I think the Catholic Church needs to, like, update its views a bit. You know, people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not super accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions about these things, which is fine, but they seem a little stuck in the past to me. If they were more open to new ideas, maybe they wouldn't worry so much about losing people.\n\nI've heard some folks are starting to turn on the Church because of how they see these issues. People don't always agree with them anymore. For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that says it's completely wrong. \n\nSame goes for gay marriage or other things like that. If you support those things, you might not want to be in a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the recent scandals. It's hard to say for sure. \n\nI mean, even if priests were allowed to marry, would that have changed things? It's tough to know. But I think it's fair for priests to have both a job and a family life, just like everyone else.",
            "Okay, so, like, about gay marriage, I'm totally cool with it. I don't think it's something people choose, you know? It's just how they are.  Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay - it's just how life goes. It doesn't feel like a choice anyone makes, so it wouldn't be fair to judge them for it.  \n\nIt feels wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.  I haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems like it shouldn't be that way.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it's a security issue, or a big moral thing. It's just people wanting to be happy. It's not like the government should be telling people who they can and can't love.  It's their lives, you know?",
            "Okay, so I think gay marriage should totally be legal. I mean, seriously, what's the big deal? \n\nSome people freak out about gay couples messing up families, but it's just not the same thing. It's like comparing apples and oranges, you know? They're both fruit, but totally different.\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of rights that come with marriage, like taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's crazy! How can they not be considered family if they're spending their lives together?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples have just as much success in their relationships as straight couples. They have the same issues, the same joys, the same stuff. It's just love, right?\n\nHonestly, all the fuss about gay marriage being a religious issue doesn't make sense. They're not asking for a church wedding, just a legal document from the government.  It's like saying a civil union is okay, but a marriage isn't. That's just messed up.\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal.  They're the same relationship, just with different genders.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but that's just fear-mongering. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples. It's about love and support, not who you're attracted to.\n\nThe government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal in every state. It's not a political issue, it's a human rights issue. We need to be accepting of everyone, regardless of who they love.",
            "Okay, so, picture this: I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It makes you think, right? Just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's not good for you.  Like, should the public have access to it? Absolutely not. But for medicine?  Totally. Because, honestly, being illegal doesn't mean something's bad. It just means it's, well, illegal.  Think about it, there are a ton of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those kinds of things. They're serious drugs, but they're helpful.  So, why should we be afraid of marijuana just because of the stigma?  We should look at its benefits, you know?\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though.  Alcohol can get messed up too, but with marijuana, it's more about how you use it.  It's tricky, but maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just throw it open.  We need to get rid of the bad rap first, then people might use it responsibly.  People think marijuana is super bad because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or anything. It's not that scary. If we change how we see it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "You know, I think the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in a cute dress, matching shoes and purse. That was the routine. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends. But now, things are different. They have this teen mass, which is only thirty minutes long!  People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the sand!  Families run in late, it's a lot more relaxed. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis these days.  It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\n\n\nAs for all the stuff about priests and the accusations, I don't think allowing priests to get married or have female priests would have stopped those things from happening.  Married men can still be pedophiles, you know? It's about the person, not their marital status.  Plus, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where priests can be married, like that Reverend guy on that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and also be married, maybe they should look into a different religion.\n\n\n\nI think pedophilia is probably more about genetics. It's not like people choose to be that way. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening.  If they knew about it and covered it up, that's terrible, but I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\n\nHonestly, at first, I was okay with the idea, but everyone was still so shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq for the wrong reasons. There were lots of excuses used to justify it.  I think the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We now know that was all a lie, and it really bothers me.\n\nThe whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil. It feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it.\n\nEven Colin Powell, after that big speech he gave at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence even when he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong.  It feels like a serious abuse of power, something that should be punishable by law.  I think the Bush administration has totally disregarded the Constitution and tried to weaken it ever since 9/11. They probably came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was even that Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who said in his book (after he was probably pushed out) that the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  And I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil resources, which is just a sneaky way to do things.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for too long.  Pulling out right now would probably cause problems because Iraq could collapse into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nThe UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could create even more problems in the long run because it would raise questions about Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nRight now, the government seems to be falling apart. The Parliament isn't working well, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in control. Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, now has a lot of seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for power, and the political situation is really tense. \n\n(laughs)\n\nThere's a lot more I could say, but it's probably not appropriate for polite company.",
            "Mmm, this is a tough one.  The whole Iraq war thing... it just feels pointless, you know? I mean, it wasn't even a real declared war.  It feels like we just went in there to get back at Iraq after 9/11. I'm not really into keeping up with all the details, but it seems like we're trying to build democracy over there, kind of like making Iraq another America. And maybe we want their oil too.  But honestly, it's just making everyone upset. \n\nStaying there forever to build democracy is a long shot. Democracy doesn't just appear overnight. Plus, if we leave, they'll probably be mad because they'll have to start over.  It's a real mess.\n\nI honestly don't know much about this topic.  It's so complicated.\n\nMaybe the war should keep going, but not really as a \"war\". It feels like we're just showing off our military power, like saying \"Look how strong we are!\" But maybe we shouldn't have called it a war in the first place, because it wasn't officially declared by Congress.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam.\n\nAnd it's hard to think about the families who have loved ones in Iraq. You want them to come home safe, but it feels like we're hurting the Iraqi people too.  They're dealing with violence and lost education because of the conflict.\n\nBut trying to change their culture to be more like ours might make things worse. It could make them hate us even more.\n\nI just don't know what the answer is. This whole thing is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal, I just don't feel right about it. It should be up to the churches, you know?  The constitution even says separation of church and state, it's clear as day. Trying to force anything on this, trying to control it, that's going against what's already written.  \n\nThose pushing to make it illegal, I think they're just picking one church's belief over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal, it's what allows for religious freedom in this country. Even thinking about an amendment, that's wrong. It would go against what's already there and be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved at all.  I don't know why this guy is pushing for an amendment unless it's just because of his own Catholic beliefs. It seems like he's choosing one religion over others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There isn't a good reason to ban it, it's just personal opinion.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th terrorist attacks, even though there wasn't a strong link. They used the emotions from 9/11 to push people into supporting the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes.  This war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.  The US took down the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for the chaos and power vacuum that followed.\n\nThey tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and promote democracy.  But the US government should have known it would be a long and difficult fight, not a quick victory.  \n\nThere will always be resistance, no matter how many people want the US there.  You're fighting citizens, not an army, which makes it really hard.  \n\nI think the government should have planned better.  They weren't prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We're still there in 2006, with American troops dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi forces. It's a long process.\n\nI feel like the government tried to mislead the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission.  Building a new government takes time, as we saw in our own country.  \n\nIt's a tough decision because we've been there so long. How can we just leave now, after removing their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice for a democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, isn't it all about oil?  We're getting our oil from there.  The whole thing feels like it's about control and resources.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though they have WMDs.\n\nI just hope for peace in Iraq soon, but I'm not optimistic.",
            "Okay, so like, I'm totally for gay marriage, always have been. It's just a personal thing, you know? And it's becoming more and more clear that it's actually biological, not just something people choose. It feels wrong to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control.  It's just not fair. I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. This is about personal choices, families, real lives. Think about it - there are gay couples in my neighborhood who are as loving and normal as any other family, even if they can't legally get married. They walk their dogs, they hang out, just like everyone else. It's ridiculous that the government tries to dictate who can and can't get married.\n\nPlus, I've read a lot about how being gay might actually be something in your genes or brain chemistry. It's not a choice, like deciding to play a sport. It's just who you are. \n\nThe whole thing feels so unfair. Straight couples can get married secretly if they want, no big deal. But if two people who love each other want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone's obsessed with.",
            "Look, when you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. Everyone can see it!  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  \n\nWhatever you post online can change how people see you. If you're talking about causing trouble or violence, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet is a public space.\n\nIf your friend on Myspace gets a bulletin about something you posted, it's not just them who knows.

They might have been able to prevent it.\n\nBut, it's tough to know what's serious and what's just messing around. Like, maybe it was a school project gone wrong, or maybe it was something really serious. \n\nIn one case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked into it, they found some concerning things on the person's Facebook page. It was stuff that might have been a joke, but in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want it seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it. \n\nI don't think teachers should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, it's hard to say it's an invasion of privacy if the person themselves shared it publicly. They have a responsibility to take threats seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war has just dragged on for way too long. At first, I thought it was for a good reason, you know, to bring democracy to a country that didn't have it.  But now, I'm not so sure. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to prove something to the world. \n\nAnd honestly, I think some of the reasons we started it might have been a little shady, maybe linked to old issues between President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to give people in that country a fair political system, then that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we showed our strength in the beginning, those first few months of the war were pretty powerful. But it's been years now, and it just seems to keep going and going.\n\nLook, if our goal was to help people who were being oppressed by a dictator, that's a good thing. But I feel like that original purpose has gotten lost somewhere along the way. Now it feels like we're just stuck in this endless fight, and we need a clear end, a real victory or something.\n\nIt's just gone on too long.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country, right? We've been pouring billions and billions of dollars into this war, money that we could be using for our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. It's a drain on our resources when the reason for the war has become unclear.",
            "So, I have a question about privacy.  Like, what if someone sees something on Myspace that could be harmful and stops something bad from happening? Is that okay?\n\nI mean, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right?  So if you add someone as a friend, aren't you giving them permission to see your stuff?\n\nAnytime you put something online, you should know that lots of people might see it.  If someone found something on Myspace that could have saved a life, wouldn't that be a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time.  It would be unfair to single out certain students and look at their profiles just because they seem \"bad.\"\n\nIt depends on the situation, I guess.  Was someone looking for something specific, or were they just randomly browsing?\n\nPersonally, I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are people out there who can see things about me online. I saw a story on TV about a guy who found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute!\n\nIt makes me nervous because people can learn so much about you from your profiles. They can see your pictures, your interests, your class schedule, even who your friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share online, but it's hard because I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who's looking at what.\n\nI heard that some high schools have banned Myspace entirely. That seems a bit extreme to me.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Hmm, you know,  this Iraq situation is tough. It feels wrong to talk about it, like I'm just jumping on the bandwagon of people saying \"I told you so.\"  But honestly, it's hard to argue against the fact that the war was a bad idea from the start.  Everyone agrees except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong.  It's like looking at all these polls – in the US, in Iraq, even worldwide –  most people think it was a mistake.  Even US soldiers there feel it was a bad call and want us out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be another mess.  There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's like a clash of cultures,  and our government just doesn't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. Saddam was bad, that's for sure, but invading a country just turns things into a disaster. It's like quicksand. \n\nI don't know what to say about it. There's no good reason to stay there anymore.  I'm sure they have reasons they think are good, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but just get us out!  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone in a year, and some want us gone now.  They're the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't be blamed if things go bad.\n\nWe might not ever be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be better off leaving than staying in this mess.",
            "Hmm, yeah, I think gender inequality is still a thing in the U.S.  It's not just about women, though. It kinda depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nWomen still face a lot of challenges because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to be a thing, sometimes guys find it hard to work under a woman because of how society has always been.  Women often get all the qualifications for a higher position but don't get promoted because people think women shouldn't be in charge.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Like, imagine a dad staying home with the kids while his wife works - it's not common. People might judge him for it, thinking a man should be the breadwinner.  But maybe he wants to be with his kids, and it works for their family.\n\nAnd in fashion,  straight guys don't always get taken seriously. Maybe because people think fashion is \"for women\" and they don't know how a man could really understand it. It's like they're questioning his knowledge just because of his gender. \n\nSo yeah, I think gender discrimination is still around, but it's different for different people depending on their field.\n\nChanging this stuff is tough because society has set ways of thinking. We've come a long way, but change is slow. But things are getting better.  More women are becoming CEOs, and people are starting to accept it.  More dads are staying home with their kids, and people are getting used to it.  And people in fashion are starting to see that guys can have a good understanding of style too. \n\nMaybe the key is to show the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped.  If we just keep pushing for change, it will happen.\n\nIt's not just about gender either.\n\nThere are other kinds of discrimination too, like based on where you're from.  Someone who grew up on a farm might not have the best grammar, but they could be super smart.  If they become a CEO, some people might look down on them because of their accent or the way they speak.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list. You know, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket now. You get a citation, not arrested. I think if someone gets caught, it won't be as bad for things like job interviews.  Usually, a drug charge can really mess you up, but with marijuana, maybe not as much.  Even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about the future.  It's expensive to arrest and process people for drugs, and then court costs a lot too.  Lots of places don't want to spend that money, even if it means they could use that money for other things, like schools or helping the elderly. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, they probably think it's fine to decriminalize it. They can use that money for better things.  \n\nBut we shouldn't just have marijuana everywhere, you know?  It's still kind of a taboo thing.  If it was legal, it might be sold everywhere, and people could be smoking in public.  That would be weird. Plus, alcohol can be pretty bad for you, but marijuana can really mess with your life more, maybe even more than alcohol. It's hard to say because everyone reacts differently to drugs. Some people can handle it, others not so much.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yes to the idea of change in the Catholic Church. You know, a lot of what they do is pretty traditional, like things they've been doing for ages. And that's good, having roots in tradition. But, wouldn't it be nice to be a bit more open to change?  Some Catholics, they feel like they *have* to go to church every week, and there are all these strict rules about how things *should* be done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly.  They don't always welcome people who aren't exactly \"perfect\" Catholics, and they don't really accept other religions either.  \n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the Church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths, does it? We're always taught to love everyone, but it seems kinda hypocritical to say you love people but then not accept them.\n\nIt's like the rules say one thing, but how they actually act goes against it.  It's all so old-fashioned, but they just keep clinging on to it. \n\n  I don't think letting priests get married would solve everything, though.  I mean, I think it would be great if they could, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know, doing bad things. It's a different kind of problem.\n\nPeople who hurt children probably wouldn't stop just because they're married.  It's not about having a spouse, it's about something much deeper.  They would probably do it anyway.",
            "Hmm... this whole marriage thing is really tough, ya know? I'm still trying to figure out where I stand. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate, and figuring out how to define marriage without upsetting anyone. \n\nIt's a real head-scratcher.  Should the government even have a say in what marriage is, especially if it's seen as a religious sacrament?  I mean, we don't get special treatment from the government just because we're baptized, right? So maybe we should just see marriage as a civil union, a simple agreement between two people? \n\nIt's like, two people love each other, they want to be together, that's all that matters. The government shouldn't be getting involved in who they are or how they define their relationship. \n\nAnd this whole gay marriage debate...  It just seems so personal. I mean, if two people love each other, why not let them get married?\n\nIf each state can agree on something like this, maybe it should become a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage? That just feels wrong.  The constitution is for big, important things, not for deciding who can get married. It just doesn't seem like the right way to go about it.",
            "Um, growing up in a Christian home, my views on homosexuality are kinda complicated.  I have lots of gay friends and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I think they should have the right to marry. I don't think it's a big national issue, though.  Each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a rule for the whole country, you know?\n\nLike, some states are more liberal, and they'll probably support gay marriage, right?  If you live in a state that's okay with it, I don't think you should really try to argue against it. You chose to live there. \n\nBasically, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So, let each state decide if they want to legalize it.\n\nI already said it, but I just don't think it's fair for Bush to say the whole country can't have gay marriage. It should be up to the individual states. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide what they want to do.\n\nSome things should be left up to each state, plus he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so like, Myspace is open to everyone, right? It's like a public bulletin board where you share stuff for people to see. So, if you post something there, you gotta know people will see it, even school officials. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home.\n\nBut you know, if checking Myspace helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, that's a good thing, right? Schools have a responsibility to keep us safe. That's super important.\n\nBut, it's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. It's easier to express yourself in writing, but you gotta be careful what you put out there because everything stays online forever.  \n\nLike, if you post something bad about someone, even in an email, it could come back to bite you later.  \n\nIt's just, you know, Myspace is public, so if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get in trouble, that's kinda their own fault.\n\nI mean, school officials have a responsibility to keep us safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then I think it's okay.",
            "Okay, so... about this whole war thing... At first, I was totally for it.  Nine Eleven really got to me, you know? I felt like we needed to hit back hard, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were all so emotional about it that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a plan, and it backfired big time.\n\nNow I'm totally against it. I don't think it's doing anything. Honestly, as long as those people are fighting amongst themselves, they're not going to be causing trouble for us.  It feels like we're just getting in the way.  \n\nNine Eleven made me kind of numb to what's going on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. They fight each other constantly and can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there totally unprepared. We had no idea what we were facing, and their idea of war is so different from ours. They're just savage, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. And maybe that's what's best.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, caught up in the emotions of it all. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change their way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge.\n\nPresident Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because people wanted it, and I understand where he was coming from. But I think we could have handled it differently. We should have had a better plan, clearer goals, and more unity.\n\nIt feels like we were just acting on anger and emotion, and that's all we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're probably always going to be like that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there forever. We can't just stay there forever, and I think we're hurting ourselves by trying to."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "So, I think the Catholic Church needs to, like, update its views a bit. You know, people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not super accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions about these things, which is fine, but they seem a little stuck in the past to me. If they were more open to new ideas, maybe they wouldn't worry so much about losing people.\n\nI've heard some folks are starting to turn on the Church because of how they see these issues. People don't always agree with them anymore. For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that says it's completely wrong. \n\nSame goes for gay marriage or other things like that. If you support those things, you might not want to be in a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the recent scandals. It's hard to say for sure. \n\nI mean, even if priests were allowed to marry, would that have changed things? It's tough to know. But I think it's fair for priests to have both a job and a family life, just like everyone else.",
            "Okay, so, like, about gay marriage, I'm totally cool with it. I don't think it's something people choose, you know? It's just how they are.  Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay - it's just how life goes. It doesn't feel like a choice anyone makes, so it wouldn't be fair to judge them for it.  \n\nIt feels wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.  I haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems like it shouldn't be that way.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it's a security issue, or a big moral thing. It's just people wanting to be happy. It's not like the government should be telling people who they can and can't love.  It's their lives, you know?",
            "Okay, so I think gay marriage should totally be legal. I mean, seriously, what's the big deal? \n\nSome people freak out about gay couples messing up families, but it's just not the same thing. It's like comparing apples and oranges, you know? They're both fruit, but totally different.\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of rights that come with marriage, like taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's crazy! How can they not be considered family if they're spending their lives together?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples have just as much success in their relationships as straight couples. They have the same issues, the same joys, the same stuff. It's just love, right?\n\nHonestly, all the fuss about gay marriage being a religious issue doesn't make sense. They're not asking for a church wedding, just a legal document from the government.  It's like saying a civil union is okay, but a marriage isn't. That's just messed up.\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal.  They're the same relationship, just with different genders.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but that's just fear-mongering. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples. It's about love and support, not who you're attracted to.\n\nThe government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal in every state. It's not a political issue, it's a human rights issue. We need to be accepting of everyone, regardless of who they love.",
            "Okay, so, picture this: I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It makes you think, right? Just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's not good for you.  Like, should the public have access to it? Absolutely not. But for medicine?  Totally. Because, honestly, being illegal doesn't mean something's bad. It just means it's, well, illegal.  Think about it, there are a ton of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those kinds of things. They're serious drugs, but they're helpful.  So, why should we be afraid of marijuana just because of the stigma?  We should look at its benefits, you know?\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though.  Alcohol can get messed up too, but with marijuana, it's more about how you use it.  It's tricky, but maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just throw it open.  We need to get rid of the bad rap first, then people might use it responsibly.  People think marijuana is super bad because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or anything. It's not that scary. If we change how we see it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "You know, I think the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in a cute dress, matching shoes and purse. That was the routine. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends. But now, things are different. They have this teen mass, which is only thirty minutes long!  People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the sand!  Families run in late, it's a lot more relaxed. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis these days.  It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\n\n\nAs for all the stuff about priests and the accusations, I don't think allowing priests to get married or have female priests would have stopped those things from happening.  Married men can still be pedophiles, you know? It's about the person, not their marital status.  Plus, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where priests can be married, like that Reverend guy on that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and also be married, maybe they should look into a different religion.\n\n\n\nI think pedophilia is probably more about genetics. It's not like people choose to be that way. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening.  If they knew about it and covered it up, that's terrible, but I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\n\nHonestly, at first, I was okay with the idea, but everyone was still so shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq for the wrong reasons. There were lots of excuses used to justify it.  I think the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We now know that was all a lie, and it really bothers me.\n\nThe whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil. It feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it.\n\nEven Colin Powell, after that big speech he gave at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence even when he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong.  It feels like a serious abuse of power, something that should be punishable by law.  I think the Bush administration has totally disregarded the Constitution and tried to weaken it ever since 9/11. They probably came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was even that Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who said in his book (after he was probably pushed out) that the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  And I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil resources, which is just a sneaky way to do things.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for too long.  Pulling out right now would probably cause problems because Iraq could collapse into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nThe UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could create even more problems in the long run because it would raise questions about Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nRight now, the government seems to be falling apart. The Parliament isn't working well, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in control. Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, now has a lot of seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for power, and the political situation is really tense. \n\n(laughs)\n\nThere's a lot more I could say, but it's probably not appropriate for polite company.",
            "Mmm, this is a tough one.  The whole Iraq war thing... it just feels pointless, you know? I mean, it wasn't even a real declared war.  It feels like we just went in there to get back at Iraq after 9/11. I'm not really into keeping up with all the details, but it seems like we're trying to build democracy over there, kind of like making Iraq another America. And maybe we want their oil too.  But honestly, it's just making everyone upset. \n\nStaying there forever to build democracy is a long shot. Democracy doesn't just appear overnight. Plus, if we leave, they'll probably be mad because they'll have to start over.  It's a real mess.\n\nI honestly don't know much about this topic.  It's so complicated.\n\nMaybe the war should keep going, but not really as a \"war\". It feels like we're just showing off our military power, like saying \"Look how strong we are!\" But maybe we shouldn't have called it a war in the first place, because it wasn't officially declared by Congress.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam.\n\nAnd it's hard to think about the families who have loved ones in Iraq. You want them to come home safe, but it feels like we're hurting the Iraqi people too.  They're dealing with violence and lost education because of the conflict.\n\nBut trying to change their culture to be more like ours might make things worse. It could make them hate us even more.\n\nI just don't know what the answer is. This whole thing is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal, I just don't feel right about it. It should be up to the churches, you know?  The constitution even says separation of church and state, it's clear as day. Trying to force anything on this, trying to control it, that's going against what's already written.  \n\nThose pushing to make it illegal, I think they're just picking one church's belief over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal, it's what allows for religious freedom in this country. Even thinking about an amendment, that's wrong. It would go against what's already there and be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved at all.  I don't know why this guy is pushing for an amendment unless it's just because of his own Catholic beliefs. It seems like he's choosing one religion over others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There isn't a good reason to ban it, it's just personal opinion.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th terrorist attacks, even though there wasn't a strong link. They used the emotions from 9/11 to push people into supporting the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes.  This war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.  The US took down the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for the chaos and power vacuum that followed.\n\nThey tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and promote democracy.  But the US government should have known it would be a long and difficult fight, not a quick victory.  \n\nThere will always be resistance, no matter how many people want the US there.  You're fighting citizens, not an army, which makes it really hard.  \n\nI think the government should have planned better.  They weren't prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We're still there in 2006, with American troops dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi forces. It's a long process.\n\nI feel like the government tried to mislead the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission.  Building a new government takes time, as we saw in our own country.  \n\nIt's a tough decision because we've been there so long. How can we just leave now, after removing their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice for a democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, isn't it all about oil?  We're getting our oil from there.  The whole thing feels like it's about control and resources.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though they have WMDs.\n\nI just hope for peace in Iraq soon, but I'm not optimistic.",
            "Okay, so like, I'm totally for gay marriage, always have been. It's just a personal thing, you know? And it's becoming more and more clear that it's actually biological, not just something people choose. It feels wrong to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control.  It's just not fair. I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. This is about personal choices, families, real lives. Think about it - there are gay couples in my neighborhood who are as loving and normal as any other family, even if they can't legally get married. They walk their dogs, they hang out, just like everyone else. It's ridiculous that the government tries to dictate who can and can't get married.\n\nPlus, I've read a lot about how being gay might actually be something in your genes or brain chemistry. It's not a choice, like deciding to play a sport. It's just who you are. \n\nThe whole thing feels so unfair. Straight couples can get married secretly if they want, no big deal. But if two people who love each other want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone's obsessed with.",
            "Look, when you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. Everyone can see it!  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  \n\nWhatever you post online can change how people see you. If you're talking about causing trouble or violence, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet is a public space.\n\nIf your friend on Myspace gets a bulletin about something you posted, it's not just them who knows.

They might have been able to prevent it.\n\nBut, it's tough to know what's serious and what's just messing around. Like, maybe it was a school project gone wrong, or maybe it was something really serious. \n\nIn one case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked into it, they found some concerning things on the person's Facebook page. It was stuff that might have been a joke, but in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want it seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it. \n\nI don't think teachers should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, it's hard to say it's an invasion of privacy if the person themselves shared it publicly. They have a responsibility to take threats seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war has just dragged on for way too long. At first, I thought it was for a good reason, you know, to bring democracy to a country that didn't have it.  But now, I'm not so sure. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to prove something to the world. \n\nAnd honestly, I think some of the reasons we started it might have been a little shady, maybe linked to old issues between President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to give people in that country a fair political system, then that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we showed our strength in the beginning, those first few months of the war were pretty powerful. But it's been years now, and it just seems to keep going and going.\n\nLook, if our goal was to help people who were being oppressed by a dictator, that's a good thing. But I feel like that original purpose has gotten lost somewhere along the way. Now it feels like we're just stuck in this endless fight, and we need a clear end, a real victory or something.\n\nIt's just gone on too long.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country, right? We've been pouring billions and billions of dollars into this war, money that we could be using for our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. It's a drain on our resources when the reason for the war has become unclear.",
            "So, I have a question about privacy.  Like, what if someone sees something on Myspace that could be harmful and stops something bad from happening? Is that okay?\n\nI mean, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right?  So if you add someone as a friend, aren't you giving them permission to see your stuff?\n\nAnytime you put something online, you should know that lots of people might see it.  If someone found something on Myspace that could have saved a life, wouldn't that be a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time.  It would be unfair to single out certain students and look at their profiles just because they seem \"bad.\"\n\nIt depends on the situation, I guess.  Was someone looking for something specific, or were they just randomly browsing?\n\nPersonally, I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are people out there who can see things about me online. I saw a story on TV about a guy who found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute!\n\nIt makes me nervous because people can learn so much about you from your profiles. They can see your pictures, your interests, your class schedule, even who your friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share online, but it's hard because I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who's looking at what.\n\nI heard that some high schools have banned Myspace entirely. That seems a bit extreme to me.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Hmm, you know,  this Iraq situation is tough. It feels wrong to talk about it, like I'm just jumping on the bandwagon of people saying \"I told you so.\"  But honestly, it's hard to argue against the fact that the war was a bad idea from the start.  Everyone agrees except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong.  It's like looking at all these polls – in the US, in Iraq, even worldwide –  most people think it was a mistake.  Even US soldiers there feel it was a bad call and want us out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be another mess.  There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's like a clash of cultures,  and our government just doesn't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. Saddam was bad, that's for sure, but invading a country just turns things into a disaster. It's like quicksand. \n\nI don't know what to say about it. There's no good reason to stay there anymore.  I'm sure they have reasons they think are good, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but just get us out!  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone in a year, and some want us gone now.  They're the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't be blamed if things go bad.\n\nWe might not ever be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be better off leaving than staying in this mess.",
            "Hmm, yeah, I think gender inequality is still a thing in the U.S.  It's not just about women, though. It kinda depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nWomen still face a lot of challenges because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to be a thing, sometimes guys find it hard to work under a woman because of how society has always been.  Women often get all the qualifications for a higher position but don't get promoted because people think women shouldn't be in charge.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Like, imagine a dad staying home with the kids while his wife works - it's not common. People might judge him for it, thinking a man should be the breadwinner.  But maybe he wants to be with his kids, and it works for their family.\n\nAnd in fashion,  straight guys don't always get taken seriously. Maybe because people think fashion is \"for women\" and they don't know how a man could really understand it. It's like they're questioning his knowledge just because of his gender. \n\nSo yeah, I think gender discrimination is still around, but it's different for different people depending on their field.\n\nChanging this stuff is tough because society has set ways of thinking. We've come a long way, but change is slow. But things are getting better.  More women are becoming CEOs, and people are starting to accept it.  More dads are staying home with their kids, and people are getting used to it.  And people in fashion are starting to see that guys can have a good understanding of style too. \n\nMaybe the key is to show the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped.  If we just keep pushing for change, it will happen.\n\nIt's not just about gender either.\n\nThere are other kinds of discrimination too, like based on where you're from.  Someone who grew up on a farm might not have the best grammar, but they could be super smart.  If they become a CEO, some people might look down on them because of their accent or the way they speak.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list. You know, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket now. You get a citation, not arrested. I think if someone gets caught, it won't be as bad for things like job interviews.  Usually, a drug charge can really mess you up, but with marijuana, maybe not as much.  Even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about the future.  It's expensive to arrest and process people for drugs, and then court costs a lot too.  Lots of places don't want to spend that money, even if it means they could use that money for other things, like schools or helping the elderly. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, they probably think it's fine to decriminalize it. They can use that money for better things.  \n\nBut we shouldn't just have marijuana everywhere, you know?  It's still kind of a taboo thing.  If it was legal, it might be sold everywhere, and people could be smoking in public.  That would be weird. Plus, alcohol can be pretty bad for you, but marijuana can really mess with your life more, maybe even more than alcohol. It's hard to say because everyone reacts differently to drugs. Some people can handle it, others not so much.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yes to the idea of change in the Catholic Church. You know, a lot of what they do is pretty traditional, like things they've been doing for ages. And that's good, having roots in tradition. But, wouldn't it be nice to be a bit more open to change?  Some Catholics, they feel like they *have* to go to church every week, and there are all these strict rules about how things *should* be done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly.  They don't always welcome people who aren't exactly \"perfect\" Catholics, and they don't really accept other religions either.  \n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the Church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths, does it? We're always taught to love everyone, but it seems kinda hypocritical to say you love people but then not accept them.\n\nIt's like the rules say one thing, but how they actually act goes against it.  It's all so old-fashioned, but they just keep clinging on to it. \n\n  I don't think letting priests get married would solve everything, though.  I mean, I think it would be great if they could, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know, doing bad things. It's a different kind of problem.\n\nPeople who hurt children probably wouldn't stop just because they're married.  It's not about having a spouse, it's about something much deeper.  They would probably do it anyway.",
            "Hmm... this whole marriage thing is really tough, ya know? I'm still trying to figure out where I stand. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate, and figuring out how to define marriage without upsetting anyone. \n\nIt's a real head-scratcher.  Should the government even have a say in what marriage is, especially if it's seen as a religious sacrament?  I mean, we don't get special treatment from the government just because we're baptized, right? So maybe we should just see marriage as a civil union, a simple agreement between two people? \n\nIt's like, two people love each other, they want to be together, that's all that matters. The government shouldn't be getting involved in who they are or how they define their relationship. \n\nAnd this whole gay marriage debate...  It just seems so personal. I mean, if two people love each other, why not let them get married?\n\nIf each state can agree on something like this, maybe it should become a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage? That just feels wrong.  The constitution is for big, important things, not for deciding who can get married. It just doesn't seem like the right way to go about it.",
            "Um, growing up in a Christian home, my views on homosexuality are kinda complicated.  I have lots of gay friends and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I think they should have the right to marry. I don't think it's a big national issue, though.  Each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a rule for the whole country, you know?\n\nLike, some states are more liberal, and they'll probably support gay marriage, right?  If you live in a state that's okay with it, I don't think you should really try to argue against it. You chose to live there. \n\nBasically, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So, let each state decide if they want to legalize it.\n\nI already said it, but I just don't think it's fair for Bush to say the whole country can't have gay marriage. It should be up to the individual states. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide what they want to do.\n\nSome things should be left up to each state, plus he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so like, Myspace is open to everyone, right? It's like a public bulletin board where you share stuff for people to see. So, if you post something there, you gotta know people will see it, even school officials. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home.\n\nBut you know, if checking Myspace helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, that's a good thing, right? Schools have a responsibility to keep us safe. That's super important.\n\nBut, it's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. It's easier to express yourself in writing, but you gotta be careful what you put out there because everything stays online forever.  \n\nLike, if you post something bad about someone, even in an email, it could come back to bite you later.  \n\nIt's just, you know, Myspace is public, so if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get in trouble, that's kinda their own fault.\n\nI mean, school officials have a responsibility to keep us safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then I think it's okay.",
            "Okay, so... about this whole war thing... At first, I was totally for it.  Nine Eleven really got to me, you know? I felt like we needed to hit back hard, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were all so emotional about it that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a plan, and it backfired big time.\n\nNow I'm totally against it. I don't think it's doing anything. Honestly, as long as those people are fighting amongst themselves, they're not going to be causing trouble for us.  It feels like we're just getting in the way.  \n\nNine Eleven made me kind of numb to what's going on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. They fight each other constantly and can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there totally unprepared. We had no idea what we were facing, and their idea of war is so different from ours. They're just savage, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. And maybe that's what's best.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, caught up in the emotions of it all. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change their way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge.\n\nPresident Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because people wanted it, and I understand where he was coming from. But I think we could have handled it differently. We should have had a better plan, clearer goals, and more unity.\n\nIt feels like we were just acting on anger and emotion, and that's all we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're probably always going to be like that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there forever. We can't just stay there forever, and I think we're hurting ourselves by trying to."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "So, I think the Catholic Church needs to, like, update its views a bit. You know, people are saying the Church is losing followers, and I think it might be because they're not super accepting of things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions about these things, which is fine, but they seem a little stuck in the past to me. If they were more open to new ideas, maybe they wouldn't worry so much about losing people.\n\nI've heard some folks are starting to turn on the Church because of how they see these issues. People don't always agree with them anymore. For example, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that says it's completely wrong. \n\nSame goes for gay marriage or other things like that. If you support those things, you might not want to be in a group that doesn't.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married. But I'm not sure if that would have stopped the recent scandals. It's hard to say for sure. \n\nI mean, even if priests were allowed to marry, would that have changed things? It's tough to know. But I think it's fair for priests to have both a job and a family life, just like everyone else.",
            "Okay, so, like, about gay marriage, I'm totally cool with it. I don't think it's something people choose, you know? It's just how they are.  Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay - it's just how life goes. It doesn't feel like a choice anyone makes, so it wouldn't be fair to judge them for it.  \n\nIt feels wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.  I haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems like it shouldn't be that way.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it's a security issue, or a big moral thing. It's just people wanting to be happy. It's not like the government should be telling people who they can and can't love.  It's their lives, you know?",
            "Okay, so I think gay marriage should totally be legal. I mean, seriously, what's the big deal? \n\nSome people freak out about gay couples messing up families, but it's just not the same thing. It's like comparing apples and oranges, you know? They're both fruit, but totally different.\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of rights that come with marriage, like taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you if you're sick. It's crazy! How can they not be considered family if they're spending their lives together?\n\nAnd studies show that gay couples have just as much success in their relationships as straight couples. They have the same issues, the same joys, the same stuff. It's just love, right?\n\nHonestly, all the fuss about gay marriage being a religious issue doesn't make sense. They're not asking for a church wedding, just a legal document from the government.  It's like saying a civil union is okay, but a marriage isn't. That's just messed up.\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal.  They're the same relationship, just with different genders.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how kids will turn out, but that's just fear-mongering. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples. It's about love and support, not who you're attracted to.\n\nThe government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal in every state. It's not a political issue, it's a human rights issue. We need to be accepting of everyone, regardless of who they love.",
            "Okay, so, picture this: I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It makes you think, right? Just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's not good for you.  Like, should the public have access to it? Absolutely not. But for medicine?  Totally. Because, honestly, being illegal doesn't mean something's bad. It just means it's, well, illegal.  Think about it, there are a ton of drugs pharmacies use that are illegal, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet—those kinds of things. They're serious drugs, but they're helpful.  So, why should we be afraid of marijuana just because of the stigma?  We should look at its benefits, you know?\n\nIt's not like alcohol, though.  Alcohol can get messed up too, but with marijuana, it's more about how you use it.  It's tricky, but maybe we should ease into making it legal, not just throw it open.  We need to get rid of the bad rap first, then people might use it responsibly.  People think marijuana is super bad because it's illegal, but it's not like heroin or anything. It's not that scary. If we change how we see it, people might use it responsibly, especially for medicine.",
            "You know, I think the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, every Sunday I'd go to church, all dressed up in a cute dress, matching shoes and purse. That was the routine. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends. But now, things are different. They have this teen mass, which is only thirty minutes long!  People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. You'll see people in their beach clothes, straight from the sand!  Families run in late, it's a lot more relaxed. Even at the morning masses, where I used to always dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis these days.  It's definitely more casual overall.  That's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\n\n\nAs for all the stuff about priests and the accusations, I don't think allowing priests to get married or have female priests would have stopped those things from happening.  Married men can still be pedophiles, you know? It's about the person, not their marital status.  Plus, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where priests can be married, like that Reverend guy on that show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone really wants to practice their faith and also be married, maybe they should look into a different religion.\n\n\n\nI think pedophilia is probably more about genetics. It's not like people choose to be that way. You can't just change that by getting married. It might come out eventually. I don't think the church could have prevented this from happening.  If they knew about it and covered it up, that's terrible, but I don't think they always knew.",
            "(laughs)\n\nHonestly, at first, I was okay with the idea, but everyone was still so shaken up after 9/11.  I think we went into Iraq for the wrong reasons. There were lots of excuses used to justify it.  I think the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 right away, saying Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We now know that was all a lie, and it really bothers me.\n\nThe whole Iraq War just makes my blood boil. It feels like the Bush administration straight up lied to the American people and still hasn't admitted it.\n\nEven Colin Powell, after that big speech he gave at the UN, now says he wasn't really convinced by the evidence even when he was presenting it! To me, that's just wrong.  It feels like a serious abuse of power, something that should be punishable by law.  I think the Bush administration has totally disregarded the Constitution and tried to weaken it ever since 9/11. They probably came into office wanting to go to war.\n\nThere was even that Treasury Secretary - I can't remember his name - who said in his book (after he was probably pushed out) that the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam Hussein because of what happened to his dad.  And I think he also wanted to control Iraq's oil resources, which is just a sneaky way to do things.\n\nThis whole thing has gone on for too long.  Pulling out right now would probably cause problems because Iraq could collapse into civil war and even more people would die.\n\nThe UN and the US are trying to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It could create even more problems in the long run because it would raise questions about Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nRight now, the government seems to be falling apart. The Parliament isn't working well, and the Prime Minister doesn't really seem to be in control. Even that guy, Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting not too long ago, now has a lot of seats in Parliament. We're still dealing with all these different groups fighting for power, and the political situation is really tense. \n\n(laughs)\n\nThere's a lot more I could say, but it's probably not appropriate for polite company.",
            "Mmm, this is a tough one.  The whole Iraq war thing... it just feels pointless, you know? I mean, it wasn't even a real declared war.  It feels like we just went in there to get back at Iraq after 9/11. I'm not really into keeping up with all the details, but it seems like we're trying to build democracy over there, kind of like making Iraq another America. And maybe we want their oil too.  But honestly, it's just making everyone upset. \n\nStaying there forever to build democracy is a long shot. Democracy doesn't just appear overnight. Plus, if we leave, they'll probably be mad because they'll have to start over.  It's a real mess.\n\nI honestly don't know much about this topic.  It's so complicated.\n\nMaybe the war should keep going, but not really as a \"war\". It feels like we're just showing off our military power, like saying \"Look how strong we are!\" But maybe we shouldn't have called it a war in the first place, because it wasn't officially declared by Congress.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, like another Vietnam.\n\nAnd it's hard to think about the families who have loved ones in Iraq. You want them to come home safe, but it feels like we're hurting the Iraqi people too.  They're dealing with violence and lost education because of the conflict.\n\nBut trying to change their culture to be more like ours might make things worse. It could make them hate us even more.\n\nI just don't know what the answer is. This whole thing is going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Hmm... this whole thing about making it legal, I just don't feel right about it. It should be up to the churches, you know?  The constitution even says separation of church and state, it's clear as day. Trying to force anything on this, trying to control it, that's going against what's already written.  \n\nThose pushing to make it illegal, I think they're just picking one church's belief over another.  Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for maybe in some places like Boston. But it shouldn't be up to the government to decide what churches can and can't do. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal, it's what allows for religious freedom in this country. Even thinking about an amendment, that's wrong. It would go against what's already there and be one of the few amendments that restricts people instead of the government.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved at all.  I don't know why this guy is pushing for an amendment unless it's just because of his own Catholic beliefs. It seems like he's choosing one religion over others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There isn't a good reason to ban it, it's just personal opinion.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq.  Honestly, I don't think the government was completely upfront with the American people about why we went to war.  Before invading Iraq, they tried to connect it to the September 11th terrorist attacks, even though there wasn't a strong link. They used the emotions from 9/11 to push people into supporting the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes.  This war in Iraq feels a lot like the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes.  So many American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.  The US took down the Iraqi government, but they weren't ready for the chaos and power vacuum that followed.\n\nThey tried to install a democracy, similar to what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and promote democracy.  But the US government should have known it would be a long and difficult fight, not a quick victory.  \n\nThere will always be resistance, no matter how many people want the US there.  You're fighting citizens, not an army, which makes it really hard.  \n\nI think the government should have planned better.  They weren't prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We're still there in 2006, with American troops dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi forces. It's a long process.\n\nI feel like the government tried to mislead the American people, making it seem like a short, successful mission.  Building a new government takes time, as we saw in our own country.  \n\nIt's a tough decision because we've been there so long. How can we just leave now, after removing their government and way of life?  But how many more American lives are we willing to sacrifice for a democratic Iraq?\n\nAnd let's be real, isn't it all about oil?  We're getting our oil from there.  The whole thing feels like it's about control and resources.  Remember, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any.  Yet, we haven't done anything about North Korea, even though they have WMDs.\n\nI just hope for peace in Iraq soon, but I'm not optimistic.",
            "Okay, so like, I'm totally for gay marriage, always have been. It's just a personal thing, you know? And it's becoming more and more clear that it's actually biological, not just something people choose. It feels wrong to take away someone's rights because of something they can't control.  It's just not fair. I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. This is about personal choices, families, real lives. Think about it - there are gay couples in my neighborhood who are as loving and normal as any other family, even if they can't legally get married. They walk their dogs, they hang out, just like everyone else. It's ridiculous that the government tries to dictate who can and can't get married.\n\nPlus, I've read a lot about how being gay might actually be something in your genes or brain chemistry. It's not a choice, like deciding to play a sport. It's just who you are. \n\nThe whole thing feels so unfair. Straight couples can get married secretly if they want, no big deal. But if two people who love each other want to get married, it's like a national scandal. It should be a private matter, not something that everyone's obsessed with.",
            "Look, when you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. Everyone can see it!  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  \n\nWhatever you post online can change how people see you. If you're talking about causing trouble or violence, someone's going to take notice. You can't just put that out there for the world to see. The internet is a public space.\n\nIf your friend on Myspace gets a bulletin about something you posted, it's not just them who knows.

They might have been able to prevent it.\n\nBut, it's tough to know what's serious and what's just messing around. Like, maybe it was a school project gone wrong, or maybe it was something really serious. \n\nIn one case, someone overheard a conversation at school and reported it. When they looked into it, they found some concerning things on the person's Facebook page. It was stuff that might have been a joke, but in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe thing is, when you put stuff online, you're basically giving up any expectation of privacy. If you don't want it seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret it. \n\nI don't think teachers should be friends with their students on social media and snooping through their profiles. But if something is brought to their attention, it's hard to say it's an invasion of privacy if the person themselves shared it publicly. They have a responsibility to take threats seriously.",
            "Hmm... this war has just dragged on for way too long. At first, I thought it was for a good reason, you know, to bring democracy to a country that didn't have it.  But now, I'm not so sure. It feels like we're just fighting for the sake of fighting, like we need to prove something to the world. \n\nAnd honestly, I think some of the reasons we started it might have been a little shady, maybe linked to old issues between President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to give people in that country a fair political system, then that would be a good reason. But if there were personal motives mixed in, that wouldn't be right.\n\nI think we showed our strength in the beginning, those first few months of the war were pretty powerful. But it's been years now, and it just seems to keep going and going.\n\nLook, if our goal was to help people who were being oppressed by a dictator, that's a good thing. But I feel like that original purpose has gotten lost somewhere along the way. Now it feels like we're just stuck in this endless fight, and we need a clear end, a real victory or something.\n\nIt's just gone on too long.  At some point, those people have to take responsibility for their own country, right? We've been pouring billions and billions of dollars into this war, money that we could be using for our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. It's a drain on our resources when the reason for the war has become unclear.",
            "So, I have a question about privacy.  Like, what if someone sees something on Myspace that could be harmful and stops something bad from happening? Is that okay?\n\nI mean, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, right?  So if you add someone as a friend, aren't you giving them permission to see your stuff?\n\nAnytime you put something online, you should know that lots of people might see it.  If someone found something on Myspace that could have saved a life, wouldn't that be a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though, because you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time.  It would be unfair to single out certain students and look at their profiles just because they seem \"bad.\"\n\nIt depends on the situation, I guess.  Was someone looking for something specific, or were they just randomly browsing?\n\nPersonally, I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are people out there who can see things about me online. I saw a story on TV about a guy who found a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger. He got her to meet him in less than a minute!\n\nIt makes me nervous because people can learn so much about you from your profiles. They can see your pictures, your interests, your class schedule, even who your friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share online, but it's hard because I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a tricky balance.\n\nI only accept friend requests from people I know, but you never really know who's looking at what.\n\nI heard that some high schools have banned Myspace entirely. That seems a bit extreme to me.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Hmm, you know,  this Iraq situation is tough. It feels wrong to talk about it, like I'm just jumping on the bandwagon of people saying \"I told you so.\"  But honestly, it's hard to argue against the fact that the war was a bad idea from the start.  Everyone agrees except for the people in charge, who don't want to admit they were wrong.  It's like looking at all these polls – in the US, in Iraq, even worldwide –  most people think it was a mistake.  Even US soldiers there feel it was a bad call and want us out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and getting out is going to be another mess.  There's no easy solution when it comes to the Middle East.  It's like a clash of cultures,  and our government just doesn't understand. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. Saddam was bad, that's for sure, but invading a country just turns things into a disaster. It's like quicksand. \n\nI don't know what to say about it. There's no good reason to stay there anymore.  I'm sure they have reasons they think are good, but I haven't heard anything convincing.  If they want to leave gradually, I guess that's okay, but just get us out!  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone in a year, and some want us gone now.  They're the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't be blamed if things go bad.\n\nWe might not ever be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be better off leaving than staying in this mess.",
            "Hmm, yeah, I think gender inequality is still a thing in the U.S.  It's not just about women, though. It kinda depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nWomen still face a lot of challenges because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though equality is supposed to be a thing, sometimes guys find it hard to work under a woman because of how society has always been.  Women often get all the qualifications for a higher position but don't get promoted because people think women shouldn't be in charge.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Like, imagine a dad staying home with the kids while his wife works - it's not common. People might judge him for it, thinking a man should be the breadwinner.  But maybe he wants to be with his kids, and it works for their family.\n\nAnd in fashion,  straight guys don't always get taken seriously. Maybe because people think fashion is \"for women\" and they don't know how a man could really understand it. It's like they're questioning his knowledge just because of his gender. \n\nSo yeah, I think gender discrimination is still around, but it's different for different people depending on their field.\n\nChanging this stuff is tough because society has set ways of thinking. We've come a long way, but change is slow. But things are getting better.  More women are becoming CEOs, and people are starting to accept it.  More dads are staying home with their kids, and people are getting used to it.  And people in fashion are starting to see that guys can have a good understanding of style too. \n\nMaybe the key is to show the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped.  If we just keep pushing for change, it will happen.\n\nIt's not just about gender either.\n\nThere are other kinds of discrimination too, like based on where you're from.  Someone who grew up on a farm might not have the best grammar, but they could be super smart.  If they become a CEO, some people might look down on them because of their accent or the way they speak.",
            "Okay, so basically, they didn't make it legal, they just took it off the criminal list. You know, instead of being a serious crime, it's more like a traffic ticket now. You get a citation, not arrested. I think if someone gets caught, it won't be as bad for things like job interviews.  Usually, a drug charge can really mess you up, but with marijuana, maybe not as much.  Even though it's not a crime anymore, people still worry about the future.  It's expensive to arrest and process people for drugs, and then court costs a lot too.  Lots of places don't want to spend that money, even if it means they could use that money for other things, like schools or helping the elderly. In places like Denver, where people are more open-minded, they probably think it's fine to decriminalize it. They can use that money for better things.  \n\nBut we shouldn't just have marijuana everywhere, you know?  It's still kind of a taboo thing.  If it was legal, it might be sold everywhere, and people could be smoking in public.  That would be weird. Plus, alcohol can be pretty bad for you, but marijuana can really mess with your life more, maybe even more than alcohol. It's hard to say because everyone reacts differently to drugs. Some people can handle it, others not so much.",
            "Hmm, I'd say yes to the idea of change in the Catholic Church. You know, a lot of what they do is pretty traditional, like things they've been doing for ages. And that's good, having roots in tradition. But, wouldn't it be nice to be a bit more open to change?  Some Catholics, they feel like they *have* to go to church every week, and there are all these strict rules about how things *should* be done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly.  They don't always welcome people who aren't exactly \"perfect\" Catholics, and they don't really accept other religions either.  \n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the Church wouldn't marry them because of his religion. That doesn't seem very accepting of other faiths, does it? We're always taught to love everyone, but it seems kinda hypocritical to say you love people but then not accept them.\n\nIt's like the rules say one thing, but how they actually act goes against it.  It's all so old-fashioned, but they just keep clinging on to it. \n\n  I don't think letting priests get married would solve everything, though.  I mean, I think it would be great if they could, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know, doing bad things. It's a different kind of problem.\n\nPeople who hurt children probably wouldn't stop just because they're married.  It's not about having a spouse, it's about something much deeper.  They would probably do it anyway.",
            "Hmm... this whole marriage thing is really tough, ya know? I'm still trying to figure out where I stand. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate, and figuring out how to define marriage without upsetting anyone. \n\nIt's a real head-scratcher.  Should the government even have a say in what marriage is, especially if it's seen as a religious sacrament?  I mean, we don't get special treatment from the government just because we're baptized, right? So maybe we should just see marriage as a civil union, a simple agreement between two people? \n\nIt's like, two people love each other, they want to be together, that's all that matters. The government shouldn't be getting involved in who they are or how they define their relationship. \n\nAnd this whole gay marriage debate...  It just seems so personal. I mean, if two people love each other, why not let them get married?\n\nIf each state can agree on something like this, maybe it should become a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage? That just feels wrong.  The constitution is for big, important things, not for deciding who can get married. It just doesn't seem like the right way to go about it.",
            "Um, growing up in a Christian home, my views on homosexuality are kinda complicated.  I have lots of gay friends and while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I think they should have the right to marry. I don't think it's a big national issue, though.  Each state should decide for themselves instead of the president making a rule for the whole country, you know?\n\nLike, some states are more liberal, and they'll probably support gay marriage, right?  If you live in a state that's okay with it, I don't think you should really try to argue against it. You chose to live there. \n\nBasically, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So, let each state decide if they want to legalize it.\n\nI already said it, but I just don't think it's fair for Bush to say the whole country can't have gay marriage. It should be up to the individual states. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide what they want to do.\n\nSome things should be left up to each state, plus he's leaving office soon anyway. If a different president comes in and wants to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide what's right for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so like, Myspace is open to everyone, right? It's like a public bulletin board where you share stuff for people to see. So, if you post something there, you gotta know people will see it, even school officials. Even if they're not looking under the school's name, they can still find it from home.\n\nBut you know, if checking Myspace helps prevent a school shooting and keeps students safe, that's a good thing, right? Schools have a responsibility to keep us safe. That's super important.\n\nBut, it's different if they're just snooping around to catch kids drinking or smoking. That feels like an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. It's easier to express yourself in writing, but you gotta be careful what you put out there because everything stays online forever.  \n\nLike, if you post something bad about someone, even in an email, it could come back to bite you later.  \n\nIt's just, you know, Myspace is public, so if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get in trouble, that's kinda their own fault.\n\nI mean, school officials have a responsibility to keep us safe, and if checking Myspace helps with that, then I think it's okay.",
            "Okay, so... about this whole war thing... At first, I was totally for it.  Nine Eleven really got to me, you know? I felt like we needed to hit back hard, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were all so emotional about it that we didn't really think things through. We went in unprepared, without a plan, and it backfired big time.\n\nNow I'm totally against it. I don't think it's doing anything. Honestly, as long as those people are fighting amongst themselves, they're not going to be causing trouble for us.  It feels like we're just getting in the way.  \n\nNine Eleven made me kind of numb to what's going on over there. I just don't care about those people anymore. They fight each other constantly and can't seem to solve their own problems.\n\nWe went in there totally unprepared. We had no idea what we were facing, and their idea of war is so different from ours. They're just savage, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. And maybe that's what's best.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, caught up in the emotions of it all. We didn't think about the consequences or how they would react to us trying to change their way of life. It felt like we were just looking for revenge.\n\nPresident Bush probably felt pressured to declare war on Iraq because people wanted it, and I understand where he was coming from. But I think we could have handled it differently. We should have had a better plan, clearer goals, and more unity.\n\nIt feels like we were just acting on anger and emotion, and that's all we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're probably always going to be like that.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying there forever. We can't just stay there forever, and I think we're hurting ourselves by trying to."
